It is tabled in the context of clarification provided to the House by the Minister's predecessor prior to his rather hasty departure from the Department in which he indicated that a special sub-committee to investigate the 21 year rule had been established as part of the conciliation process.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	As I have previously outlined in the House, a claim from the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, in respect of this matter is being dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration. As military life places unique physical and psychological demands on individuals, it is necessary that members of the Defence Forces be physically and mentally prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations and undertake their duties on deployment overseas. It is vital that the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised. As such, to maintain the age profile of the Permanent Defence Force to carry out the operational tasks required by Government, it is necessary to have a constant input of new recruits into the Permanent Defence Force. The maximum age for personnel who have enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force post-1 January 1994 provides the mechanism through which a satisfactory age profile can be achieved.  I understand the concerns this issue raises for the personnel due to be discharged in terms of their personal circumstances and the impact on their families. I assure the Deputy that in examining this issue all pertinent facts have been considered. However, while significant progress was made in discussions between PDFORRA and civil and military management, it was not possible to reach full agreement. As a result, the issue is being referred to third party adjudication for a ruling. It is expected that the adjudication hearing will take place in the next few weeks following the exchange of submissions between the parties. In the meantime, work is continuing on measures to support those exiting the Permanent Defence Force. A number of military courses are already accredited with various third level institutions and a comprehensive training course to aid transition to civilian life for the personnel in question is being piloted.

We must first consider the profile of those who are being discharged under the 21 year rule. They are largely young men and women aged in their late 30s and early 40s who are carrying heavy mortgages and have considerable family responsibilities arising from the overall costs of day-to-day life. These individuals are to be discharged into an economy in which full employment remains some way off. The Minister has invested considerable time, political capital and energy in trying to address the crisis in the beef sector, which is appropriate. I put it to him, however, that this issue is at least as important to the Defence Forces as the critical circumstances in the beef sector are to farmers. For this reason, I ask him to invest the same level of effort and political capital and energy in efforts to resolve this matter.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	It is important to make a distinction between policy decisions and a process that was agreed and is under way in the Defence Forces to try to bring this issue to a conclusion by finding an acceptable and reasonable compromise.That is what we have been trying to do through arbitration and we have now moved to a third-party process. Instead of making a political decision on the basis of lobbying or in an effort to be popular, we are seeking a solution that is in the best interests of the Defence Forces and the people who serve in them by ensuring they are of an age and health profile to do the very difficult work they need to do. We have had many examples of the demands of that work, particularly overseas, in recent months. The primary concern here must be to ensure we have the right age profile in the Defence Forces so that people are prepared for and able to cope with the tough life of a soldier. It is important, of course, to look after people who have been in the Defence Forces and take into account their personal circumstances. It is also important that we provide an avenue into the forces for new recruits. We must have a constant feed of fresh blood in the form of young and fit men and women. In order to facilitate that, we have to take people out of the system.

#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I appreciate what the Minister is saying and we are not at odds on this issue. My point is that people should be able to continue to serve where they are capable of doing so, have the necessary level of mental and physical fitness and in the context of the huge investment the Defence Forces have made in their training. Changes have already been made in that commandants can now serve until they are 58 years of age and lieutenants until age 54. Members of the Garda Síochána and prison officers, who have fairly onerous responsibilities, can now serve until the age of 60. When one does a comparison between the exit age this 21-year rule imposes on Defence Forces personnel, one sees it is very much out of kilter with that which applies to the permanent defence forces in other countries. We should by all means use the mechanisms to which the Minister referred to address this issue but, ultimately, he has a critical role to play in resolving it.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	It is important to bear in mind the historical context here. The individuals concerned started off on a five-year contract and a great deal of flexibility has been shown in accommodating and extending their careers within the Defence Forces. I expect that some flexibility will also be shown in this instance. I want to see an arbitration process and an independent third party adjudicating to make decisions which take everything into account rather than the pure political considerations. I accept that some of the families concerned are facing very real difficulties. However, my primary responsibility is to ensuring the overall coherence and effectiveness of the Defence Forces in terms of policy around age and health profiles and the fitness of personnel, individually and collectively, for the difficult work they must do. Of course, if some of the individuals concerned have a skillset which adds to that and should be accommodated through flexibilities, then I expect the third-party arbitrator will point to that. We must await the outcome of that process rather than making a political decision.

David's family members appreciate the assistance they have received from the Army Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence. My colleague, Deputy Ó Fearghaíl, is familiar with all of this as he also has been working on this case. Will the Minister agree to meet members of the family to resolve this matter finally?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. As Minister for Defence, I take the opportunity to express my sympathy for the family of Cadet David Jevens following the very tragic and difficult accident in which he lost his life. I realise it has taken a very severe toll on David's parents. We want to do everything we can to assist the family in getting through a very difficult and dark time. I will, of course, meet members of his family if that is their wish. My predecessor met them and there have been ongoing meetings at Secretary General and Chief of Staff level to try to address the results of the three inquiries that have taken place into the circumstances of this tragic accident, all of which reaffirmed the fact that David had no responsibility or fault in this matter. That is the factual position as shown in those three inquiries. We are making the appropriate statements and adjustments where necessary to assure the family that this is the factual position and is recorded as such. It is also my understanding that there is a level of agreement between the family, the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff on the issue. However, if it would be helpful and reassuring, I will be happy to meet members of David's family.

My understanding is the same as the Minister, namely, that the issue is very close to being resolved. Nevertheless, the family would very much like a meeting with the Minister. We can never give these parents back their son, but we can move to take away any suggestion that he had any responsibility whatsoever for the accident which caused his death. I hope the Minister will organise a meeting as soon as possible.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I am happy to do so.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	The issue I am raising was raised by my colleague, Deputy Mick Wallace, on the last occasion on which the Minister for Defence took Question Time. It relates to the effectiveness of our overseas missions. Currently, we operate under a number of different banners and on a fairly ad hoc basis. Does the Minister intend to stand back and review the effectiveness of our overseas missions? Would it not be better to restrict ourselves to fully-fledged UN missions rather than the system of ad hoc engagements we have been pursuing?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland's foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting our international obligations as a member of the UN and the EU. Irish foreign policy is directed at supporting co-operative arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, especially the United Nations, and supporting effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights. This approach continues to define Irish priorities within the UN system and Ireland remains willing to play a full role in contributing to the security of Europe and the world. The Defence Forces are currently primarily deployed on overseas missions in support of international peace and security under UN mandates. However, with the increased use of more robust chapter VII missions, the UN has turned to regional organisations such as the EU, the African Union and NATO to manage operations on its behalf and under its authority. This is one of the most significant changes in UN efforts at maintaining international peace and security. In effect, the EU and NATO, together with other similar such organisations, are now major players in UN peacekeeping. Peacekeeping also adds to Ireland's national security by containing conflicts and reducing the threat of conflicts spreading. UN peacekeeping missions, such as UNIFIL, have made a real difference in countries such as Lebanon. The UNIFIL operation has supported political transitions and helped the region to close a chapter of conflict and open a path to normal development, even if major peace-building challenges remain.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	The point I am making is not that we should stop participating in overseas missions but rather that we should take a step back and consider where and how we engage in such missions. The Minister referred to "effective peacekeeping" and that is precisely what I am talking about. Our current policy has been described as a type of scattergun approach which sends Irish soldiers as unarmed observers to a multitude of locations.These are often sent in small numbers. In the context of the limited resources available to the Defence Forces and the limited impact small numbers can have, we should stand back from that. It is a worrying trend that we are getting involved with forces under EU and NATO banners. For example, the mission in Chad is more about furthering French economic interests than a serious attempt at peacekeeping. The question seeks to examine missions such as the Congo, where 5 million people have died due to conflict since 1996. This has been ignored by European states and others. A fully-fledged UN mission, with Irish troops participating, could have an effective role rather than the current scattergun approach.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	I understand the point the Deputy is making and we must prioritise. The Defence Forces has limited capacity in terms of peacekeeping abroad and we do not want to spread ourselves too thinly. It is important to distinguish between peacekeeping missions or other peace support missions the UN or NATO co-ordinate and the role of the UN in that. The way the UN undertakes missions in different parts of the world has changed. The UN asks collective organisations like NATO to lead missions on behalf of the UN. Ireland is not involved in any peacekeeping missions that do not have the blessing, support or mandate of the UN. We work with international partners in order to effectively do a job in partnership with, or for, the UN. The Partnership for Peace is a good example of how people work together. The missions we are on have UN support and normally Ireland goes at the request of UN in order to do that. This week, we made a decision to send Defence Forces personnel to Sierra Leone in west Africa to support efforts to combat Ebola. If we were waiting for a UN resolution, we would have real difficulties but we are doing a job in response to a call from the UN for assistance. That is how these things work.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	We are not asking the Minister to slavishly follow any international organisation but to stand back, as Minister for Defence, and look at the effectiveness of our troops abroad. The reality is that countries like the Congo have been exploited and abused by western powers and colonialism for decades. No one is interested in them but French interests are being advanced in Chad and that gets support. There are UN missions we are involved in but we should not just accept them because they are UN missions. We must look at areas where conflicts have been running for decades, like the Middle East, which is going on since 1948 and there has been Irish involvement since 1958 in the Golan Heights. There comes a time when the presence of UN peacekeepers becomes a facilitating mechanism for the continuation of conflict and does not deliver peace. That is why we must stand back and look at all of our missions to see how our troops can be more effectively deployed for the best reasons.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	We do not accede to every request. We have a strong reputation within the UN for a country that has Defence Forces with the level of experience, expertise and skill set to do difficult post-conflict and peacekeeping operations. We do that in partnership with a number of other countries that have a reputation for doing the same. Any decision to send Defence Forces personnel abroad is not taken lightly. We have not been in the Golan Heights since 1958. The current United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, mission in Golan Heights has only had Irish involvement for little over a year. We were asked by the UN to fulfil a particular role in that UNDOF mission and we have done so. We did so in difficult circumstances and Irish people should be proud of that. We have avoided any tragedy, injury or loss of life in that mission. My job is to make recommendations to the House and Government in terms of where we prioritise resources in different parts of the world. I take the Deputy's point on the Congo and agree it is a part of Africa that has been abandoned in many ways to tragic effect. However, Ireland cannot solve every problem and we must prioritise where we send our troops. We evaluate in a detailed way before we do that.

It did so because of issues concerning the standard of living of members of the Defence Forces. The question directly challenges the Minister to establish what he proposes to do about the very difficult standard of living many members of the Defence Forces must contend with.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I was made aware of number of issues for the first time at the recent PDFORRA annual conference. I presume the Deputy is referring to the claim that five members of the Permanent Defence Force were sleeping in cars because they could not afford the cost of commuting to their place of work and claims that approximately 20% of PDFORRA’s membership are availing of family income supplement. There is no reason any member of the PDF should be sleeping in their car. I am advised that military management wrote to the general secretary of PDFORRA requesting information to facilitate the chain of command addressing any legitimate concerns of PDFORRA. I understand that a response has been received from PDFORRA and that individual issues raised within it are now being appropriately addressed through the normal operational chain of command. We have a lot of residential infrastructure within barracks and people should be accommodated if they need to be. PDFORRA also asserted that approximately 20% of its membership is availing of family income supplement, qualifying for it because their take home pay had fallen owing to various public service agreements and statutory deductions. As the circumstances surrounding an application for family income supplement are a private matter between the applicant and the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Defence is not aware of the number of PDF members that may be in receipt of this financial assistance, or their individual circumstances.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	We all accept the Defence Forces have been leaders in change management as far as the Irish public service is concerned. To a certain extent, it has become victim of its own success. The issue of people sleeping in the car is the direct consequence of the radical changes made by the Minister's predecessor in terms of the closure of barracks and creating situations where people were forced to make daily round trips of up to 300 km to their place of work. The issue of family income supplement is more fundamental. We have been talking about the valuable role our Defence Forces play in observation and peacekeeping internationally and of the pride the Minister, all Members and the Irish people have. Is it not appalling to think that people we deploy internationally to carry out these responsible tasks must depend, in the case of 20% of them, on the Department of Social Protection to meet their day-to-day living costs?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I cannot confirm the 20% figure because I do not know that it is factually true. I have no reason to disbelieve PDFORRA and I will be meeting the organisation shortly to discuss a range of issues. I presume this will be one of them. There are many sectors of Irish society, particularly across the public sector that have seen and experienced financial pressures over the past five years. Members are aware of that. It is important that we are realistic about the context of the financial pressure many Irish families find themselves under and the context of wage agreements, the latest of which is the Haddington Road agreement. It is my job to review pay structures and the way we pay members of the Defence Forces. I will do that within the Government.A review is ongoing in that regard. It is important to recognise where we have come from over the past five years, as well as the extent of financial pressure that the public sector has been facing. That is the context in which these issues have been raised. Hopefully we can look to a more positive future in terms of income levels across the public and private sectors.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	What the Minister said about the pressures on Irish families and income pressures on people in the public service generally is correct. However, it appears that a particular problem arises in the Defence Forces. I have no difficulty accepting the 20% figure given by PDFORRA because it reflects my experience in my constituency, where a large number of Defence Forces personnel live. I am also aware of anecdotal evidence that the pressure on the Defence Forces' credit union is enormous, as people struggle to meet their day-to-day living costs. The Minister referred to pay negotiations. I have proposed to the House that members of the Defence Forces should be allowed at least associate membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in order that they have an input into pay negotiations. Is the Minister prepared to concede that?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	No, I am not prepared to concede that. The Defence Forces are different from other organisations and public sector roles. When one signs up for the Defence Forces, one is signing up to a life defending the State and this is accompanied by certain rights and responsibilities. I am not willing to concede that at the moment, but certainly there are channels within the Defence Forces through which people can raise issues. Arbitration is also available in the Defence Forces. The Government's decision in September 2012 and the review of allowances and premium payments conducted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recognise there is a structural weakness in the way members of the Defence Forces are paid, and a decision was made to conduct a full review of overall pay structures and pay systems in the Defence Forces in the medium term. It is my intention that such a review will take place subsequent to the review of the security duty allowance and technical pay which is under way. That is proof we are investigating the matter with a view to making improvements but we must also recognise that the Defence Forces are somewhat different from other organisations in the public sector.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	This is essentially the same issue as that raised by Deputy Ó Fearghaíl. I note the Minister acknowledged there is a problem with pay in the Defence Forces but his defence is that he did not know about it or is now looking at it. The facts speak for themselves. The level of pay in the Defence Forces does not meet a threshold of decency in a large number of cases and has to be supplemented by the social welfare system. He is correct that the situation has been aggravated by the austerity cutbacks on public sector workers over the past several years but the roots of it lie in the fact that traditionally members of the Defence Forces have been paid less than their peers in other areas. That has to be addressed.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I take some of those points. I do not want to repeat my reply to the previous question. Two Departments are involved in this matter, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. We are trying to maintain a Defence Forces strength of 9,500. We are in the process of taking on a significant number of new recruits to ensure we maintain that strength, which obviously will have budgetary consequences. I will insist that the reviews to which we have committed take place. We will consider the outcome of those reviews when they are ready and, hopefully, we will be able to act on them. Many families and people in the public sector and, in particular, in the private sector have needed support from the State in terms of income levels in recent years, for all sorts of individual and, in some cases, very complex reasons. I do not think we should draw broad sweeping conclusions from this particular matter. The issues arising in the Defence Forces around pay and remuneration will be the subject of a review in the not too distant future, and let us await the outcome of that review.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	It is not a case of broad sweeping conclusions. The criteria operated by the Department of Social Protection provide that if an individual's income falls below a certain level, social welfare steps in to bring it to a level of decency. One need only look at the pay rates in the Defence Forces to know why this support is particularly necessary in this context. Irish Defence Forces personnel have always been poorly paid. I was brought up in a Defence Forces family and I know these long-standing problems. However, the problem has been aggravated by the cuts and the 20% loss of earnings since 2009. That has consequences. Unless the review is prepared to examine the basic pay rates for Defence Forces personnel, the problem will persist. The Minister does not appear willing to budge in that regard. The issue of people sleeping in cars is linked to barracks closures but it is also linked to the undermining of residential accommodation to which, according to the Minister, people are referred. I know of people in the Curragh who are not affected by barracks closures but who cannot find residential accommodation on the Curragh because of the way it has deteriorated and the number of families who have been forced out of residential accommodation due to Defence Forces policy. The Minister has a duty of care to Defence Forces personnel and these pressing issues have to be addressed.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I take seriously my duty of care to Defence Forces personnel. In regard to basic pay, the only pay agreement for which this Government is responsible is the Haddington Road agreement. There was no cut to basic pay for enlisted Defence Forces personnel under that agreement. I will not go into previous pay deals or decisions previous Governments were forced to take. That is our record. We have also recognised the need to review some of the elements of pay and remuneration in the Defence Forces, and we are proceeding with that. I take the Deputy's point and, on the basis of the review, I will have a credible set of recommendations on which to act. When we get the recommendations we can bring them before the House for discussion and, hopefully, the Government will be in a position to act on them.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	Pay does not solely comprise basic pay. While basic pay may not have been cut under Haddington Road, it is none the less a fact that the payments to and average earnings of soldiers have deteriorated by 20% since 2009 because of the cuts in allowances which form an essential part of their pay packets. These issues have to be addressed. I note that the Minister is not in favour of giving them negotiating rights but he will be aware that PDFORRA is taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights and, as a consequence of the judgment in the case brought by gardaí which allowed them to access the State's industrial relations machinery, that privilege should be extended to the Defence Forces. The Minister might be better off agreeing that with them rather than being forced to act by Europe.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	The only reason I referred to basic pay was because the Deputy referred to basic pay. I accept that other elements also affect people's incomes. I am not pretending this is not an issue. I also acknowledge that other elements of Haddington Road have impacted on effective take-home pay of people in the Defence Forces. Of course we will take note of any legal judgments made in Ireland or the European Union and if there are consequences to those judgments, we will act on them.

Following the closure of the accident and emergency department in Roscommon County Hospital, the local community took the initiative of seeking to establish an air ambulance service.In 2012, the Government established a 12-month pilot air ambulance service using the Air Corps helicopter. Although the service has been a phenomenal success, we have no clear commitment regarding the retention of the service. It is being extended on a three-month basis.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	As the Deputy will be aware, as he has been involved in this issue, in June 2012, a memorandum of understanding was agreed between my Department and the Department of Health, in regard to Air Corps support of a pilot emergency aeromedical support, EAS, service operating out of Custume Barracks, Athlone. The purpose of the pilot service was to assess the level and type, if any, of dedicated aeromedical support needed to assist the national ambulance service, primarily in the west for certain types of patients. The pilot focused on the requirements of the HSE clinical care programmes, such as acute coronary care and stroke. An evaluation of the pilot service was undertaken last year by an inter-agency audit and evaluation group and a report submitted to the then Minister for Health, who accepted the report's recommendations that an EAS service should be established in the region and that consideration should be given on how best to provide such a service. A working group, chaired by the Department of Health and comprising representatives from my Department, the HSE and the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services, was then established to examine options for the provision of a permanent EAS service into the future. The group is nearing completion of its work and its report will be finalised shortly. Meanwhile, my Department has agreed to extend Air Corps participation in the pilot service, in order to allow time for the working group to complete its work. As the Deputy knows, it has been agreed in principle to maintain the service. What is being decided is how to do it and under what cost structure. The details will be available very shortly.

However, would he not agree that continually rolling over the three-month period is undermining the service? Would he not agree that the Air Corps, in conjunction with the national ambulance service, has developed a very fine service? There is great mutual respect between the organisations, and the Air Corps is very anxious to be part of the permanent structure. Can the Minister assure the House that the Air Corps will form an integral part of any new structure announced?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	This has been a very good success and a great partnership. The Defence Forces, as always, have shown they can be flexible and accommodate broad requests and concerns with which they are asked to assist. The Air Corps has done a great job. We await the result of an implementation group on how we can provide the service into the future on a permanent basis. If the recommendation is that the Defence Forces continue to provide a service, we will look at it, I suspect, very favourably. However, it may not be the recommendation. Let us wait until we get that recommendation. We will keep the service in place until the working group's recommendations are clear and we have a plan to implement them. I am happy to do so. There will be no end to the service. It is about maintaining a pilot project, to which my Department and the Defence Forces, through the Air Corps, have been integral. We will maintain that service until there is an implementation plan and a clear understanding as to how the permanent service will be put in place. If it involves a request to the Defence Forces, we will consider it, I suspect favourably, but I will wait and see what the recommendations are first.

The nub of the issue is that the most cost-effective way to deliver the service is through the Air Corps. There is no net cost to the Department of Defence for providing the service. Due to air traffic control rules, the Air Corps has more flexibility than a commercial operation would have. Why does there seem to be reluctance on the part of the Department of Defence to grasp this wholeheartedly and ensure the Air Corps is central to the development of any new service?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	There is no reluctance at all. We have been a fully-fledged partner in providing the service, which everybody accepts has been a great success. However, it is a pilot project which we will keep in place until a permanent structure and implementation plan has been agreed. If such a plan involves a request for Defence Forces participation, we will consider it, and I suspect we will do so favourably. The Defence Forces are not a health service. We are part of a pilot project that has worked very well and will look at partnering any future proposals and roll-out plan if we are asked to do so. We should wait and see what the implementation group proposes, how it proposes to fund it and how the structure will work, so we can have an air ambulance service for the west of Ireland that functions well on the back of the very successful pilot project. The Defence Forces are, and will continue to be, very supportive of the project.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I ask the Minister for a breakdown of his plans for new recruitment in the Defence Forces, including the Permanent Defence Force, Reserve Defence Force, Air Corps and Naval Service. Are there any plans for new apprentices and agency staff? Can he also comment on revising the 21-year limit for members of the Defence Forces who are willing and able to continue in service?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	I thank the Deputy for his question. The Government is committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 people, comprising 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service personnel. I am advised by the military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, at 30 September 2014, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,200 comprising 7,413 Army, 757 Air Corps and 1,030 Naval Service personnel. The personnel requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force, targeted recruitment has been and is taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels. General service recruitment will continue in 2015 from the recruitment panels formed from the current general service recruitment competition launched in March 2014. Some 441 recruits have been enlisted to the Army and Naval Service to date, of which 385 remain in training. The intake of cadets into the Permanent Defence Force is normally carried out on an annual basis taking into consideration the operational requirements of the Defence Forces and the resource envelope allocated to the Department of Defence. It is too early to say what the requirement for an intake of cadets in 2015 may be. Direct entry competitions are held as required from which specialist appointments are filled. A competition for the recruitment of five engine room personnel for the Naval Service is currently under way, with a closing date of 14 November 2014. A competition for the appointment of doctors remains open with applications being accepted on an ongoing basis. A Reserve Defence Force, RDF, competition was also launched in March 2014. As a continuation of this campaign, the Defence Forces are currently accepting applications for the RDF until 14 November 2014. Future recruitment into the RDF will be informed by RDF strength figures. With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas. On the 21-year rule, I would refer the Deputy to a very long and detailed answer I gave on that issue earlier.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	I thank the Minister for his response. Is he satisfied with the level of training new recruits will receive and the level of ongoing training for current members of the Defence Forces? Does he believe the Defence Forces are adequately equipped? In the context of the inspectorate's review of the Garda, how would the Defence Forces stand up if the spotlight was shone on the situation that prevails at present? With regard to pay, Deputy Daly noted that changes to allowances have resulted in Defence Forces pay reducing by 20% since 2009. Is the Minister happy the pay levels are sufficient to encourage new recruits to enter the Defence Forces?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	There is certainly strong demand for the recruitment calls that are under way at present. In fact, I have received letters from various Deputies making cases for people who have applied and so on. There seems to be strong demand for that, despite the fact there are issues in need of review in regard to remuneration and pay. In terms of equipment, I am satisfied we have adequate and appropriate levels of equipment and we are investing in new equipment all the time. As the Deputy will know, for example, the big expenditure in the Naval Service has been on new ships, which means there will be three new ships in three years. I cannot ever remember a time when that has happened before, and it is happening at a time when the Government is under a lot of financial pressure. We have already seen the LE Samuel Beckett, next year we will see the LE James Joyce and we will see a third ship 12 months later. Likewise, there are investment programmes for the Army and Air Corps. I am satisfied that we are investing in the Defence Forces. With regard to the overall situation, as it happens, the Defence Forces have been looking at themselves. We have had an outside person who is eminently qualified looking at issues like morale, bullying and reporting channels and support systems for personnel within the Defence Forces.

When will that report be completed and published? I ask him to provide more detail on the extra investment in the Army and Air Corps. I accept investment has taken place in the Naval Service.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	That report has been published. I launched it in Collins Barracks some two months ago. The author was there and talked about her experience of literally being immersed in the Defence Forces and all of its complexity, and so on. It was the third such report published by the same team as part of the attempt to modernise and put new structures within the Defence Forces. We see on the front of The
Irish Examiner today, unfortunately, a case of totally unacceptable behaviour within the Defence Forces which is currently being investigated by military police. That should not be happening within the Defence Forces and we will deal with it. In terms of the broader look at the Defence Forces, I want to reassure the House there is a very critical look in the mirror to make sure we are doing everything that is appropriate in terms of a modern, well equipped, well trained and motivated Defence Forces. If mistakes are being made, we will address them in an open way.

He will also probably know United States forces no longer use this drug. I want to probe whether there are alternatives and whether the Minister will stop the use of this drug in the Defence Forces.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The lariam debate is controversial and has been for many years. I remember taking lariam at one point when I went to travelling in Africa, and having the debate with my doctor on this issue, so it is not new. The Deputy will be aware that malaria is a very serious disease which kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone. It is a grave threat to any military force operating in that area. In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria. The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces includes the use of lariam, and I would contend it is working. The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, formerly the Irish Medicines Board, is the statutory authority with responsibility for quality, safety and efficacy of medicines in Ireland. The Defence Forces policy in regard to the use of anti-malaria medication is in line with current HPRA guidelines. The Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side effects attaching to all anti-malarial medications. Significant precautions are taken by the Medical Corps in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications, all of which have some side effects. There are three anti-malarial drugs licensed by the HPRA in use in the Defence Forces, lariam, malarone and doxycycline. It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness and medical suitability for service overseas, including a medical risk assessment for lariam.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
Where malaria has been identified as a risk in a particular mission area, the choice of chemoprophylaxis medication is dependent on a number of factors, including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller - contra-indications, underlying health conditions and purpose of travel - the duration of travel and adherence issues. The choice of medication is a medical decision made by medical officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. Former Ministers for Defence have had the various allegations surrounding the use of lariam investigated thoroughly and obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces. Anti-malarial medications, including the use of lariam, must remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.

I am aware there are legal cases under way. My worry is that, rather than the State just acknowledging there is an issue, it will defend it to the last and continue to use lariam when there are other options available. It worries me that the United States armed forces have stopped the use of lariam. We know the array of advisers they have - multiples of what we have in Ireland - yet they have made that decision. I am not a qualified scientist or pharmacist but it causes me concern that the reason we have not stopped the use of this drug is that we are going to defend legal cases and fight them all the way. My concern is that the outcome of this may be a damning indictment of this State.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I want to set the record straight on something I consider very important. We are not continuing the use of lariam because of legal cases that are being taken. We are continuing the use of lariam in the Defence Forces to ensure we have a responsible approach towards ensuring members of the Defence Forces do not contract malaria. We are acting on the advice of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the former Irish Medicines Board, as most people will know it. I am not a qualified doctor either but I took medical advice before I took lariam. Luckily, I did not have any side effects from it and I did not contract malaria either, and I have been to Africa many times. The Defence Forces are making decisions on the basis of the best medical advice that is available in Ireland and in terms of the best and most effective way of protecting our Defence Forces when they are operating in a country that has malaria. That is the only motivation here. If we get a change of recommendation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, we will act on that, regardless of court cases. The only priority for me is protecting our Defence Forces and to ensure we do everything we can to protect them when they are in a difficult environment abroad. Malaria is a big part of that because we have a lot of troops in Africa.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	There is no challenge to the fact the Minister is fine after taking lariam or that we need to protect ourselves from the threat of malaria.My point is that a number of former members of the Defence Forces believe their mental health problems are connected to side effects from taking lariam. The United States forces have stopped using lariam. Have our relevant authorities ever engaged with the relevant authorities in the United States to ask why they removed lariam and if there are grounds for us to do the same?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	There are many people in this House who sometimes are not overly complimentary about the US military in terms of some of the decisions it makes but for me, that is not so much the issue. We have medical advice available to us in Ireland, which is of the highest standard, and we follow that advice. That is from where we take our lead. If there is growing international evidence to the contrary, we will look at it, whether it is in the US or in some other part of Europe or the world. I assure the Deputy that the only motivation here is the best interests of and the medical protection of our armed forces. If the Deputy has a concern about anything in this area, he should send it to me and we will look at it. The only reason I mentioned I took lariam was that I was making the point that if one is not a doctor, is a policy-maker or has a different skills set and is making a medical decision, one takes one's lead on that decision from those who know what they are talking about and who understand medicine and the challenges of lariam and malaria which, as far as I am concerned and from an Irish perspective, is the Health Products Regulatory Authority. We will take our lead from that body unless there is reason to raise questions because of international evidence, which we will look at. 
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	In the lifetime of this Government, although not under the Minister's watch, just short of €3 million of taxpayers' money was spent on security contracts with the Israeli company, Elbit Systems, which has been found guilty of violating international law. Now that the Minister is Minister for Defence, will he give us an assurance that the public procurement policy of the Defence Forces will include a ban on any dealings with companies found in violation of international law?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I have previously outlined the position in regard to the procurement of defensive equipment by the Department of Defence. I have also explained the scale and type of such equipment the Department has acquired from Israeli companies in recent years and the purpose of such acquisitions, which is to afford the greatest possible force protection to Irish troops. The matter of barring Israeli companies from entering tender competitions for the provision of military goods would be akin to Ireland unilaterally placing an embargo on such goods from Israel and this raises serious implications for Irish foreign policy which are outside the remit of my Department. As the Deputy is aware, trade policy and market access are largely EU competencies and any restriction or ban on imports from any particular country would have to be concerted at EU level. The manner in which the Department of Defence procures goods and services remains constant with international best practice and is in line with EU and UN decisions on trade embargoes. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate way in which to continue rather than Ireland taking any unilateral decision to target individual companies or countries in that respect.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	The Minister outlined previously what was bought, what it was used for and under what procurement policies it was bought but that was not really the question he was asked to deal with, as I am aware of all of those things. The question being posed here is that when companies engage in unlawful practices and we do business with them, then we are facilitating that. While there might be procurement policies, it is also the case that many of the Minister's international peers, recognising this injustice, have taken positive action to ensure they do not have dealings with companies which violate international law, as all of those operating in the settlements do. I am thinking, for example, of the British Government which has an overseas business risk policy that outlines and tries to encourage people not to deal with the settlements. The Dutch Government has been actively involved in providing advice to companies not to deal with the settlements while the Norwegian Ministry of Finance prevented pension funds' money from going into this system for the same reason. The Minister can take proactive action. It is not unilateral action. The Minister had no problem signing us up to sanctions against Russia, which affected Irish farmers, but he does not seem to have any difficulty standing by while women and children are massacred in Gaza. We can take positive action in these matters.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	Is the Deputy suggesting we should not have taken the foreign policy decisions we took in regard to Russia?

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	We have not taken unilateral action in regard to Russia. We are part of an EU decision to impose sanctions because of what has been happening in eastern Ukraine. It is not unilateral action. None of the examples the Deputy outlined in Britain, Norway and the Netherlands involve an embargo being imposed by a government on individual companies or on Israel, as a country. They are examples of countries trying to use pressure points to get change. Ireland has made strong statements on much of what has happened in Israel and Gaza in recent months and we will continue to do so because we have a strong Government position on those issues. However, what the Deputy is asking me to do is effectively to blacklist companies because of a policy position or a view on those companies. What I am saying is that Ireland generally makes decisions as part of a collective within the EU or the UN in regard to sanctions or embargoes on the basis of a recommendation at multilateral level rather than a unilateral level.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	The point I was making was that the Minister supported an embargo in regard to Russia but is not, in any way, advocating a similar action be taken against Israel. The question did not relate to all Israeli companies but specifically to those which violated international law and those involved in illegal Israeli settlements, which is a slightly different thing. The Norwegian Government took direct action. I am not asking the Minister to deal with public procurement policy, as that is not his ministerial brief, but he is responsible for how the Defence Forces spend taxpayers' money. Is he prepared to stand over a situation where taxpayers' money, spent on Defence Forces' machinery, is being given to companies involved in violating international law because that is the case with Elbit Systems? It is not up for any dispute whatsoever-----

That is a decision we have made. If there is a collective proposal at UN level to take targeted action and to use trade as a way to force change in some part of the world or in a region, then Ireland will be part of that discussion but I am not in a position to make foreign policy decisions in regard to individual companies, and certainly not on the back of a parliamentary question.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	The Afghan war was probably the most senseless and useless one we can recall. It has gone on for twice as long as the Second World War. There really is not much merit in Irish troops being there and they probably should never have been sent there in the first place. US and British troops are leaving Afghanistan with their tails between their legs. How soon will the Irish troops leave Afghanistan?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	I am not sure I agree with the Deputy's assessment. Ireland has participated in the NATO–led UN mandated International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, in Afghanistan since 5 July 2002. Seven members of the Permanent Defence Force are currently serving in the mission headquarters. The ISAF mission is due to conclude on 31 December 2014 when Afghani National Security Forces will take over full responsibility for security within Afghanistan. NATO will lead a follow on training and support operation called resolute support mission with effect from 1 January 2015.  Defence force participation in all overseas missions is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The overall drawdown of ISAF personnel is currently under way and the withdrawal of the Defence Force personnel will be co-ordinated in this context. Irish personnel will complete their service with the ISAF mission in December 2014, which is when the ISAF mission ends.  The proposed NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, post 2014, will be a follow-on training advisory and assistance mission in support of the Afghan National Security Forces capacity building. The question of Ireland's contributing to the follow-on mission in Afghanistan is being considered in the context of what other contributing countries are planning. Any participation by Ireland in the follow-on training mission will be subject to Government approval.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	The Irish troops were involved in advising NATO personnel on bomb disposal. If the Government leaves the troops there for the next phase they will advise Afghani state troops, which will be a very dangerous exercise. It would be like an outsider coming to Ireland during the Civil War and giving Michael Collins’ men advice on bombs. It is just looking for trouble. The Minister questioned my analysis of the war. The war started as an effort to destroy Al-Qaeda, which has mushroomed since. It went on to become a campaign for democracy and women’s rights. Women’s rights have gone backwards since then. It became a war to protect Western cities, and it has done the opposite. It became a war to eradicate opium production but that is at a record high with the production and supply of 90% of the world trade. Any action on the part of Western powers in Afghanistan has been a disaster.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	I am saying that I do not agree with the Deputy’s full assessment of it. There have been and continue to be huge challenges in Afghanistan. Ireland’s view has always been that we would make a limited contribution to sharing an expertise that we have from a training perspective. Our people are in headquarters there, and are not involved on the front line. It is not akin to joining a civil war. If we make decisions in the future it will be on the back of a request and a consideration of that request as to whether Ireland can contribute to stability and peace-building in Afghanistan following a very difficult, traumatic and tragic war there, about which I fully agree with the views expressed by the Deputy. That will be the consideration. We are not considering front-line troops. We are considering potentially making a contribution to building capacity within the Afghani security forces so that they can run their country.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	The Irish personnel who get involved in these missions are very well trained and highly qualified. We have nothing but peace to work towards when we get involved but the people we often get involved with do not. Peace is not the objective of the Western powers in this or the Middle East region. If it was, things would be happening differently. President Obama in his term of office has bombed seven Muslim countries-----

It is a good time to review progress from where we were four or five years ago. I compliment the Minister for Social Protection on her efforts. I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, on his elevation and I wish him well in that office. How lucky this country is that it was possible to survive in the kind of climate the present Government was greeted with when it took office three and a half years ago. Every morning when we woke up over those years we had a concern or query as to whether there was something coming down the track that would cause further confusion and create a problem for the Government and the people. We must recognise the huge sacrifices made by the people the length and breadth of the country, those who were employed and those who were unemployed, those in need of care and carers, those who have disabilities. Every part of our social strata was detrimentally affected in some way or another by the exigencies within which the Government had to operate. We have been very well catered for in the way the Government has handled the situation. If it had done something different and behaved irresponsibly three and a half years ago we would be in a far worse situation than we were five years ago. It was a question of being cruel to be kind, to make sure there was something available to everybody in so far as was possible and that the most vulnerable in society survived. At the same time it tried to encourage and create employment. That was a very difficult task.  The incoming Government was told that unemployment was at an all-time high, the bills and debts had mounted hugely and it must run the country with no money and try to survive. That was a tall order. I have been listening to Opposition Members in recent weeks and have at the back of my mind a concern that they seem to have forgotten where we came from and where we could quickly return if we are not careful.The dangerous notion that everything in the garden is rosy is developing quickly. Many improvements have been made and a great deal has been achieved, albeit at great cost. If we are not careful to be judicious in the way we spend our money and cater for our economy, we will quickly go back to where we were and there will be no recourse from any quarter. We will not even have the benefit of bailouts because we will not be regarded as a good risk. Many people say there are alternatives, but I assure the House that if there were alternatives, the Government would have found them long ago. Those who glibly put these so-called alternatives into the public arena, including my good friend on the other side of the House, have suggested that €1 billion can be gathered from various sectors of the wealthy, the well-off and the rich-----

We will not go there. Careful management of this country is now required. I remind the House and especially the sole Deputy sitting on the Opposition benches that when the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, left office in 1997, the books were balanced and everything on the record was in order. Every single economic indicator was right. Along with his colleagues in the outgoing Government at that time, he was blamed for not spending more money to buy the 1997 general election. Elections were bought subsequently by people who spent money unwisely and created expectations that were above and beyond the ability of this country to deliver on them. If there is anybody here now who believes we should take that course again, they should stand up and say how they are going to do it. I know it cannot be done. I compliment the Government on their efforts to date. I hope they can continue to run the country effectively, efficiently, fairly and in a balanced way without selling it and its people down the drain for repayments at a later stage. I hope all the hard work that has been done so far will be rewarded. I hope the people who made all the sacrifices so far will be rewarded in the time ahead in the way they should be and expect to be. It cannot all come at one time, but the intention is there. It will happen as long as we manage our finances carefully.

#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	111	I am delighted to congratulate him on his appointment and to welcome him here in his official capacity. I would like to address two aspects of the Social Welfare Bill 2014. First, I draw attention to the degree to which the Bill recognises the sacrifices and huge efforts made by ordinary people in keeping faith with this Government's correct economic strategy, which has clearly worked across all measurements and criteria. I refer, for example, to fiscal management, job creation, consumer confidence and inward investment. The people kept faith with it and made great personal sacrifices in very difficult times. The wonderful thing about the Bill before the House is that it rewards and recognises the people's effort, sacrifice and faith for the first time. I would like to mention some of the headline features of the Bill. The increase of €5 in the rate of child benefit will increase the monthly payment from €130 to €135. This is a recognition of the submission made by the Children's Rights Alliance, which reported that 18.8% of children and young people under the age of 18 are currently at risk of poverty and 9.9% of them are currently living in poverty. The incremental restoration of the Christmas bonus - this year's increment is a significant 25% - is another great recognition of the sacrifices made by the people over recent years. It means a great deal to old people who want to buy presents for their darling grandchildren and their other family members at Christmas. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, and the Tánaiste to ensure this wonderful initiative continues next year in order that we can get back to the full bonus. That would be good. I would like to applaud the Tánaiste on a remarkable achievement of this Government that is being continued. I refer to the retention of core social welfare rates in the middle of the deepest recession - our Great Depression. I also recognise the increase in the living alone allowance, which is another new thing in this budget. The increase of 3,000 in the number of people participating in the JobsPlus initiative will bring the total number of participants to 6,000. Some €12 million is being provided for the introduction of a new employment service to be known as JobPath, which I will discuss in a minute. The provision of an additional €2 million for the school meals initiative is a hugely important piece of social engineering and social justice. Although it might be missed by many people because it seems trivial, it will have an impact. I am a teacher by profession and I have taught in all types of schools and areas. I am aware that the school meals initiative needs expansion and should be expanded. As we address this Social Welfare Bill, I commend to the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, and the Cabinet in general the extension for a second year of the early childhood education initiative, which is a wonderful thing. I want to address the Government's big achievement in the Department of Social Protection since it came into office. In addition to retaining core rates and maintaining the dignity of vulnerable people by supporting them, it has changed what was known paternalistically in the past as the dole - a handout to mollify people and keep them quiet - by introducing job activation measures that give jobseekers an opportunity to seek work.The great success has been JobBridge and the number of people who have found employment and returned to dignity through it. While there are little aberrations and malpractices, there are also supervisory dimensions. JobBridge has been a great Government initiative. When we entered into office, 7,000 jobs were being lost per month. Now, 5,000 jobs are being created per month and unemployment has decreased to 11%. We have moved from the concept of unemployment to one of job activation. The back-to-work family dividend that will come into play in January 2015 as a consequence of this legislation will assist families in availing of employment opportunities and moving off social welfare. They will be able to retain their increases in qualified child payments of €29.80 per week for up to two years after leaving social welfare. This is a great initiative. I am also gladdened by the number of extra people on JobsPlus. I would like to have developed my next point further, but I must recognise the constraints of time. I am keen for us to work hard on the job activation front, including training and interviewing people in a supportive rather than aggressive or intimidatory way to find their strengths and give them opportunities to return to the workforce and regain their dignity and self-confidence. This is critical. I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence. This Bill is great legislation and we should be proud of it. The Bill's hallmark is how it tells the people that, having made sacrifices, now is the time for payback. We have begun the process of restoring the fortunes of people who made great efforts for our country.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	114	I would love to. I thank Deputy McGuinness. Many of the points that I want to make on this legislation are not positive, but I do not want the Minister of State to believe they are directed at him. I made them during the motion on the budget three weeks ago. This is a Second Stage debate on social protection legislation to put into effect those budgetary decisions, but it is not a debate at all because the decisions have already been made. We are just going through the motions, which forms part of the reason that I have a problem with how the Dáil operates. The decisions were not even made by the Cabinet. Rather, they were made before they went to the Cabinet. I do not know why we continue to stand over practices in which we do not believe. Labour Party Ministers who are not members of the Economic Management Council, EMC, have criticised its operations and how it sidelines the Cabinet. They are right. We have a Cabinet Government, which means no fewer than seven Ministers. This may not be the most efficient way to run a Government, but if one believes that, one should change the Constitution, which puts the Cabinet at the centre of the Government. The Cabinet is the body with the authority to make decisions. However, when it comes to matters like the budgetary process, we have seen how even the Cabinet has been sidelined. Labour Party Ministers also do not agree with the idea of a budget day on which we spend one day per year announcing all of these secrets, as they were described, to the country. Those Ministers called this crazy, which has been repeated at the Committee of Public Accounts. Why do we continue doing it? These are processes we want to change, yet we are not changing them. To answer the question of why knowledge and power should not be concentrated in the hands of a few people, it leads to bad decision-making. Consider 2008 and 2010. Why should we not debate in detail budgetary figures on a year-end basis, get them costed independently as Deputies and go through the different ideas, possibilities and permutations before we make a decision? That is what the Dáil is meant to do. Consider the eight years that led up to the financial collapse and what the Dáil did not do. Why are these debates important? In just a short time, and based on economic data covering what was also a short period, we went from taking €2 billion out of the economy to investing €1 billion. We have not discussed that decision at all. It smacks of a mentality of, if we have it, we will spend it. We know where that got us. I want to go into the details and examine the consequences of the decisions we are making, but what is the point if I cannot even be involved in the debate before the decision is taken? It is counter-intuitive. When there is an unexpected buoyancy in the economy that may be temporary, why do we commit that money to permanent spending measures? Does this Bill signal the end of the reform of our State sector and how it spends money? We have increased child benefit, a universal payment that goes to some of the wealthiest people in the country. How can we stand over that? If the payment were not universal, there would be more money to go to those who need it most. After we commissioned an independent report on whether to continue universal payments, we ignored it. The report recommended continuing universal payments, but at a much lower level and with means-tested increases for those who needed them most. This is what we are supposed to be doing. Before going into government, we discussed how to do things differently, yet we ignored a report that we commissioned. We did the same in the case of Irish Water, which is why we have problems with that body's current structure, including its system of payments. Consider the back-to-work family dividend. The OECD criticised our level of social welfare payments for acting as a disincentive to people returning to work, yet we increased social welfare spending to achieve just that. It is a perverse logic that the Dáil has not discussed in detail. People may not agree with me, but there is no point in having a Second Stage debate when the decisions have already been made and the only room for amendment is where the Department realises it has overlooked something or made a mistake. That is not the proper approach. In no way can Parliament or Cabinet hold the EMC to account when the process operates in this way. On a final but positive note, I will refer to some of the labour activation initiatives that the Minister of State has been undertaking. He announced one recently during an evening with a chamber of commerce. They are fantastic. He is considering a new website and using technology to provide to employers the live curricula vitae of people who are trying to return to work. It is another brilliant idea, one that I hope is implemented quickly. Positive initiatives like that one show what new people can do in their roles to break old thinking.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	I join Deputy Eoghan Murphy's comments on how we set out the budget strategy. We debate measures after the event. For example, we are debating the Social Welfare Bill after the announcements have been made in the budget. It is true that for years, every Government and Opposition has called for reform in the House, but we never seem to get it. There is a need for reform, but this Government did not bring it about despite being mandated to do so. That is a pity. Had there been reform, the budgetary process could have been fed into by Deputies who deal with matters in their constituencies every week that show up the faults of a system. If Deputies could use that knowledge in a meaningful debate that brought about real policy change, it would be exceptionally good, not only for the Department, but for the people who found themselves having to engage with social welfare. Instead, the budget debate sees a tinkering with the system - €5 here, a cut there and a change in regulation somewhere else - but no strategic thinking on where we are going with social welfare, job activation and care for pensioners and the marginalised. Not all of us will march to the same frantic drumbeat. There will always be those who must be looked after in society. If we are to acknowledge this fact, we should do so efficiently and well. I question the four people who run the Cabinet and the country. I consider their qualifications and the last time they created a job or were on the front line looking into the abyss and had nothing. It was a long time ago. Without personalising the debate, the Taoiseach has been in the House for a long number of years.The same is true of the Tánaiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Finance. I do not suggest they do not hear things at their constituency clinics that influence them one way or the other. However, this simply is not a good way in which to do business. People are making decisions who, quite frankly, are not able to be influenced by debate in this Chamber and it is meaningless unless this can be the case. I acknowledge it is the job of Government party Members to pick out the best and to deliver the message for the various parties. Members of my party did it when they were on the Government side of the House as well. However, if one considers the measures in the context of what I see in my clinics, there is a huge delay in the processing of applications. For example, in the case of carer's allowance applications, six or nine months could elapse before someone gets an application for a carer's allowance through. Moreover, if it is refused and goes to review, appeal or oral hearing, it will take much longer. I have seen cases in the system that have been there for more than 12 months. At times, those who really are entitled to such an allowance are refused it for some unknown reason. These people have made a good case, have presented their medical information and are looking after someone, but yet they are put through the wringer excessively in respect of qualifying for carer's allowance. The same applies if one considers the appeals system itself. It simply goes on forever and at the end of that line, one is dealing with someone who has no money, probably is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance and probably is entitled to what he or she is getting. Consequently, I seek an audit of all these applications, how they are processed, how long it takes and how quickly they then can be turned around into an efficient and positive return for the client who has been forced by circumstances to seek social welfare benefits. Were the Minister of State to set his mind to this and were he to achieve it, he would be doing a great deal for those who are marginalised and have nothing. If, at the end of the process, the answer was the applicant was not entitled to the benefit for which he or she had applied, at least then the applicant knows. However, it is just unforgivable to leave people in limbo and to have them go back into the system repeatedly. I do not suggest it is the fault of the Minister of State; it is the fault of Members here in this House that they do not recognise it and then, if necessary, force the people on the Minister of State's right, that is, the departmental officials, to bring about the appropriate changes in policies that will make the system more efficient. Another point about efficiency that is evident at the meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts is that each year, millions of euro are lost to the Exchequer because of what the Department of Social Protection puts down as being a fraud or errors in the system. If a business had fraud and errors that were losing €500 million through that process each year, it would be bust. The Department of Social Protection, like many other Departments does not learn from the mistakes. It does not learn that this is how something happened and, therefore, it should apply itself to ensure it does not happen again. How many more people in receipt of social welfare benefits would be satisfied with an increased benefit or would benefit from a saving in respect of these losses? The Department would have €500 million more to ease the pain and the burden on those who are in receipt of social welfare benefits. Sometimes, it is not a question of securing the increase that is the challenge or the success story; it actually is taking the system and making it work more efficiently and for those who must engage with it because of their circumstances. I ask the Minister of State to give consideration to this point. All Members have heard about the difficulties arising in respect of the JobBridge scheme. I came across a number of people who were employed in a sporting area who were let go and subsequently replaced by a person from the JobBridge scheme. That does not achieve anything and is just a waste of time. It may be nice to massage the figures afterwards and, incidentally, all Governments do that. This is not a direct criticism of the present Administration as it has been done in the past. However, the Government would not allow this to happen in respect of the establishment of new businesses. One could not get a grant from a county enterprise board if a similar business was nearby, as that would be called displacement. Yet, there is a willingness to tolerate displacement in the JobBridge area. This has not been thought out and it is not working to the extent it should to bring the success to the scheme that was planned for initially. It would be worthwhile to consider this issue. The issue of domiciliary care allowance has been raised here and, in particular, women came to Leinster House and raised it. While I acknowledge some effort has been made to streamline it and make it more effective, many more simple things could be done that would deal with this issue and would bring about an understanding from the applicant as to what is required in an application. The simple comparison made by the mothers and those who were concerned about the domiciliary care allowance when they visited Leinster House was that were the Department of Social Protection to take the application form used in the United Kingdom and use it here, it would simplify matters and would allow them to focus on what the Department really was examining. That is what they sought and suggested, but I must tell the Minister of State and his officials that they left Leinster House seriously disappointed that the engagement they were allowed to have with the Minister and the system did not yield for them the simple changes they perceived to be necessary to make life easier for them and others in the context of the application. Again, this reverts to systems and to an application form. This is similar to the time when the rental allowance scheme was being operated by the Department of Social Protection. When the figures began to reach an almighty high, no one paused to say this scheme was not fulfilling the housing needs where it should be. No one thought of diverting the funds in question to building local authority houses and giving people secure homes. Everything just went on in the same vein and nothing really has changed that much. The Government now has put in place the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, which is the same nonsense with a different description. It is the same thing. When will we get around to having a reform that gives local authority houses to people, thereby giving them a sense of a home and a sense of place? It would also give people a sense that the Government actually cares for them, because the main message to come out of a lot of these issues is the Government does not care - be it the previous Government or its predecessors - because people do not perceive the necessary reform that would have a positive impact on their lives. Members owe it to those who elected them to stand by the mandate the Government was given, which is for reform and greater efficiencies. Before the budget, Members spoke of those who were self-employed. They came through the good times, paid their taxes, were employed and were central to the economy. Now however, they do not get anything from the economy. They are forced to leave these shores and seek employment elsewhere. We are losing an entire generation, a lot of whom were enthusiastic entrepreneurs, some of whom were employed by others but in the same vein as an entrepreneur, and they are gone. An entire generation of knowledge and experience has departed from these shores simply because the system would not look after them. Moreover, they were not lifers but wanted access to the system while they got on their feet, after which they would be back creating employment. Members are looking to the small to medium-sized enterprise sector to create the same level of employment as previously, namely, almost 1 million give or take, and now those people have left and are gone. The greatest con trick in the budget and what has happened subsequently is the Government gave small increases.Small as they are, those increases are welcome, but taking the money back in the form of water charges is just a joke. In its current form, Irish Water needs to generate a certain level of income from water charges that will allow it to pay both the wages of its bloated complement of staff and the extras and top-ups it has introduced for them and also to pay for the services of consultants. Deputy O'Dowd is aware of what is going on within Irish Water and he was correct in highlighting it. One cannot create a super-quango such as Irish Water which is going to feed off the unfortunates in society who do not have anything in order to obtain its income and then state that an entire raft of people will not be obliged to pay water charges. How does the Government propose to balance the books in this regard, particularly if it is going to exempt certain individuals from paying or give them a number of credits? Somebody must pay for Irish Water. I suggest that the Government abolish the latter and not charge people for water. It should instead consider how the open taxation system which previously held sway might be restructured. As the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, is aware, Europe is telling us that we must raise cash and deal with our loans off the books. In order to do this, one must create an entity. We refer to such entities as quangos and the one we established was Irish Water. What is wrong with county councils dealing with leaks in the system, etc.? If one contacts Irish Water to report a burst pipe, it will be fixed by staff from one's local friendly county council. What is happening now is that we are being obliged to pay for an extra level of bureaucracy which is just not needed. Nobody identified either the quantity of leaks within the system or the number of pipes which must be replaced. What has all of this to do with the Social Welfare Bill? The answer is that those in receipt of social welfare payments are going to be obliged to pay water charges. The Minister of State's party is obliged to appease its supporters, which is what the Labour Party should be all about. I respect the input of the Labour Party into this Government's work but its members must be stronger, they must represent the people and they need to tell the fat cats to whom they often referred when they were on the Opposition side of the House to get off the bus. Those so-called fat cats are not doing the job they were appointed to do. That job could be done more efficiently and at less cost elsewhere. Those are the facts. When one considers the increases people received in the budget and then examines the position with regard to the taxes - water tax, property tax etc. - they are obliged to pay, one must ask how they can afford to live. I have met older people who are not putting food on the table in order to make ends meet. These individuals are members of a generation of men and women who like to pay their bills. I am sure that, like me, the Minister of State has been informed by such people at his clinics that they would not like to die owing money. We are creating a situation whereby, in light of the establishment of the fair deal scheme and everything else, they will die owing money. Is there no humanity or compassion in the system at all? Are we simply striding towards the European model where everyone is a number and where interventions by public representatives are considered a nuisance? It will only be when we, as public representatives, take charge of policy and force it into place and actually begin to represent the people who elected us that we will garner more respect and be in a position to respond to the needs of society. In the context of the small things, I wish to refer to alarms and the telephone allowance for the elderly. These are things which make them safe in their homes. Do we not understand what we have done to these people? We have forced them to apply for medical cards through the system that has been put in place only for them to be informed that their applications have not been received. They must then go through the whole rigamarole again of completing what is a very long form and obtaining doctors' letters and resubmitting their applications. Those applications are then either refused or placed under review and the people involved are obliged to lodge appeals. In the name of God, what are we doing to those we represent? These people have served this country for generations. They worked harder than we have ever worked and they saw bad times of a type we have never seen. We call the country in which we live a republic. The Minister of State is a republican and so am I. Would he treat his people in the way I have described? If he is a republican, he should not. Would a republican dip his or her hand into the pockets of citizens and take money out of them? I do not believe so. We will be celebrating the centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016. Is ours the type of country for which those who took part in the Rising died? I do not believe it to be. The country they wanted would have been one in which the common good and people and their homes would have been central and which would have been willing to support those who are marginalised and elderly. All I want of this Parliament is for it to ensure that the elderly and those who are marginalised will be looked after. I am also seeking that those in government should fulfil the first responsibility of Government, namely, to care for the people and ensure they are safe. Governments have failed in that responsibility. They have failed to keep the people safe. As a result, elderly people throughout the country are terrorised not by the fear that their homes may be broken into but as a result of the fact that they do not count anymore and their belief that the Government is after them. This big State of Ireland is frightening the life out of its citizens, which is a disgrace. This has been happening for so long that we do not even notice it. We are scaring the living daylights out of people who are on waiting lists or in hospital and elderly individuals who want just a little money, comfort and an acknowledgement of their plight. However, we are running away from them. The Labour Party has always been respected in Irish society as a result of its efforts to defend those who are marginalised and less well off. I urge the Minister of State and his party colleagues to put the pressure on within Government and to remember the people who elected them and who they represent.

I agree with him regarding the issues affecting our society that need to be addressed. Obviously, I would not agree with all the prescriptions he offered but I concur with him that the need to care for people who are less well off, who are ill or who have families must be central to our society. That is what the Government is trying to do with this Bill, particularly in the context of the increase in child benefit. Notwithstanding the fact that the amount of money involved will be small, this is the first occasion in a significant number of years that support for families and children will be increased. That is a good start. The living alone allowance will also be increased and the Christmas bonus will be paid at a rate of 25%. We are not yet in a position to restore the bonus in its entirety but we are certainly making a move in the right direction. When we entered office three years ago, the unemployment rate stood at 15.3%. It has now fallen to 11%. As more people return to work and find themselves in a position to better sustain their families, it is only right that whatever money is available be used to support those who are unemployed to return to work also. We must support and encourage those who are less well off than us. In the context of democracy, that is the proper route to take. Members of different political parties on the Opposition side of the House often complain about our social welfare system. I accept that it has many faults.However, it is not at fault in the sense that it is a better system than the one in the North. Notwithstanding the concerns of older people, they are better off in the South than in the North, and our support systems are better. I have always said, both in opposition and in government, that the Department of Social Protection is the most efficient Department I have encountered. When I was sitting in the seat now occupied by the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, he had some nice things to say about me so I will start with him today. His Department is important and very responsive, accountable and focused. I was recently invited to the Department's local office to see the changes it is bringing about to help the unemployed, encourage them to come in for an interview and have their CVs examined, and determine how to encourage them to get a new qualification, perhaps in an area they never thought about. It is a question of the joining up of social elements and working out what is best for the people by changing. We must all change and help to bring about that change. It is a case of providing new resources in a respectful way. I do not know whether the Minister of State remembers the day of the hatch. I remember people going to the hatch to do their business. I very much objected to that. Now one is interviewed while sitting down in a private space, and one can communicate with the officials. That is how it should be. Notwithstanding that, there are serious delays in the system. I agree that appeals times are far too long. One can apply for a review, and I acknowledge that the Department accepts new information given to it at any stage, even if the relevant date has passed by. The Department is available to listen to one's case, read the relevant documentation and make judgments and changes when one can show they would benefit those concerned. My staff recently brought to my attention the fact that people on long-term illness benefit cannot get the fuel allowance. My office and constituents believe this needs to be reviewed. If one is on long-term illness benefit, one should benefit from the fuel allowance. That one cannot do so is an anomaly. A good aspect of the current reforms is the housing assistance payment to people who are looking for housing. The system in this regard is administered through the local authority. I welcome the payment because this is the first time that constituents working for a very low income can and will be considered for increased financial supports. That is a very positive move because the transition from unemployment to work is very difficult for families. If they can get financial support, which was previously unavailable to them, this will be very welcome. The question of carers has been raised by other speakers, with whom I agree. The means testing of carers takes a long time. Many of the cases are complex and may not be as simple as we might think at times. However, more resources need to be made available to deal with the applications. It would make a fundamental difference to those being cared for, their families and carers. A significant reduction in the delays is very important. The Department may not have a role in respect of all my views on the role of the community welfare officer. The community welfare officer system is excellent. The training, skills and knowledge of community welfare officers, which they clearly demonstrate throughout the country, including in my county, are top class and excellent in every way. I work with community welfare officers every week. A big mistake that has been made is the centralisation of the medical card application system, which resulted in an appalling debacle. When responsibility for applications was removed from the local community welfare office and transferred to some place in Dublin, or wherever it is, it was a bad day for every applicant. The community welfare officer had the necessary skills, knowledge and communication ability, and knew the applicants and their families. The officers were always available to listen to applicants' cases. We all know that it is not a question of making a black-and-white decision in the health system. There are grey areas in that although people may have more money theoretically than they are allowed to have, there can be extenuating circumstances that a community welfare officer would be in a position to judge. Not accounting for such circumstances is the major downside of the administrative decision to centralise the system. It has made it unacceptable to people. When I get on to the medical card authorities, I do not have a problem, but some of my colleagues tell me one can raise no more than three cases per day. I do not receive this complaint about the number of cases I raise but, if I did, I would not accept it from the officer. If the complaint is made, some policy needs to change. I fundamentally believe that getting back to basics and returning to the concept of the community welfare officer is important. The system for allocating grants to people with disabilities who need to make adjustments to their homes to allow for independent living was the responsibility of the former health boards and is now the responsibility of the local authorities. There needs to be much more flexibility. There is far too much black-and-white thinking in this regard. A simple sit-down shower in somebody's home would make a great difference to one's quality of life. It just seems impossible to get it in many cases. We need an urgent review of the system. It is not necessarily the remit of the Minister of State but it is part of the process of caring for people in their homes to which we need to return.  I welcome the legislation and the changes that are being made. The legislation is a start. It is easy to be critical and say it is not enough. Of course, it is not enough; it will never be enough but at least there is social change and we are giving an opportunity to the less well-off, unemployed, those with young children and those living alone to have better quality of life. The change is small but it will be significant. As our economy improves, I hope we will increase the amount of money to which people are entitled to live out their lives in a proper way. As the awful, appalling misery that was visited upon the State by the previous Government fades into the background, quality of life will improve for everybody.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	117	I formally congratulate my friend, colleague and former neighbour, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection. It is apt that he has this role because he has experience of unemployment. His life experience makes him particularly well suited to the role he is playing. I am glad he has responsibility for job activation because we need to move away from the old handout mentality that was characteristic of the social welfare system. It should be a case of a hand up rather than a handout so we can help people move towards employment rather than just languish in unemployment, which has such a detrimental effect on both individuals and communities. The more we do that, the better. With regard to job activation measures, assuming that the unemployment rate will continue to decrease, we will need to examine very carefully whether measures that continue to be in place will continue to be fit for purpose. In the past, many schemes were left in place long after their sell-by date. We need to ensure programmes such as JobBridge remain appropriate and are not being abused by employers.While there is clear evidence of a majority moving from JobBridge into full employment, there are also complaints about those on JobBridge being abused and the scheme being used merely to fill a job that should properly be filled by a paid person. That culture needs to permeate the Department. If I can also address the move towards the housing assistance payment scheme, which is a good scheme, the fundamental issue in terms of housing is to construct more housing, whether social or private, particularly in the cities. The housing assistance payment scheme is a good one in the sense that it helps to remove a poverty trap but it will need to be watched carefully because I suspect that there will be considerable resistance to it from tenants. There are many aspects of the budget for social welfare where for the first time in seven years we have seen increases, and some of those are very welcome. Obviously, even though it is a small increase, it is welcome that there is a €5 increase in child benefit. I particularly welcome the extra €2 million for the school meals programme. From what I am told by school principals, it would be beneficial if that could be pushed out as much as possible because there is no doubt that school children who are hungry do less well than those who are sufficiently fed. It is a fairly obvious point but it contributes in the long run towards preparing people for being able to work. The more the scheme is improved over the years, the better. It is worth noting that in spite of the trauma that this country has gone through, for most we managed to maintain the basic unemployment rate at €188 per week. That is in considerable contrast to our neighbours across the water where one is talking about a rate is less than £65 a week. It is worth noting that we managed to do that. In conclusion, I also support the remarks Deputy Eoghan Murphy made on the Economic Management Council. It is time to go back to regular Cabinet Government.

The first issue is in the area of jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed. It is something I feel strongly about. I was self-employed before I went into politics. We need to have parity of treatment. If the business of someone who is self-employed fails, it is a traumatic time. In that situation, the person does not qualify for jobseeker's benefit and must apply for jobseeker's allowance which can take a considerable amount of time. The issue has been examined by the Department and by the Minister over time. In terms of being reforming, we need to examine putting in place a system whereby the self-employed can qualify for jobseeker's benefit. At present, the PAYE taxpayer can qualify for jobseeker's benefit based on the contributions he or she earns. If there are more than 260 contributions paid, one gets jobseeker's benefit over nine months and if there are fewer than 260, he or she gets it over six months. Perhaps we need to put something in place for jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed for three or six months. It is something we need to examine. I would ask that it would be reviewed urgently by the Minister and her Department. The second key area which comes up quite often at present is PAYE taxpayers being able to claim jobseeker's benefit. If someone has lost a job or where, for instance, the number of hours in which he or she is on the job are reduced, currently one can only claim jobseeker's benefit as an employee if one is unemployed for four or more days per week, which translates into working for three or fewer days per week. If one goes above the latter threshold, one does not qualify for jobseeker's benefit. I have dealt with cases recently, including someone who was in a job working 30 hours a week. The employer decided to reduce the worker's hours to eight hours per week, but wished the employee to come in at least an hour per day and the employee was working over the five days. The employee did not qualify for jobseeker's benefit. It is completely unfair. It is a draconian measure. We need to examine how we can reform the system to allow such employees to base it on hours as distinct from days. In the case of this individual, he did not qualify for family income supplement, FIS, because he was not working the requisite hours and he could not qualify for jobseeker's benefit because he was working more than three days per week, even though that was only roughly an hour or an hour and a half per day. Effectively, he was forced to give up his job because he had a young family. We must look at the way the system works currently. I would advocate two simple straightforward measures which relate to both employees and the self-employed. For PAYE workers, it is a relatively straightforward measure. We need to change jobseeker's benefit from being assessed on a daily basis where one may work only three days or less, which would equate to 20 to 24 hours per week, to where one cannot work more than 20 or 21 hours, or whatever, per week. Given the trends, one should translate it from days into hours and allow workers remain in employment. Regarding the self-employed, if we are looking to adopt an entrepreneurial culture where citizens will create jobs, both for themselves and for others, we must allow them the same treatment as a PAYE taxpayer. We need to examine putting a structure in place whereby the self-employed can qualify for jobseeker's benefit, make contributions towards that and be given such facility so that if their business fails, they are not placed in the dramatic position where they are unable to provide for themselves and their families. I would ask that those two simple measures be taken on board by the Minister and implemented. It is something I feel strongly about for my constituents in Limerick.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	I note Deputy McGuinness asked, "Would a republican dip his or her hand into the pockets of citizens"? If that republican was a member of Fianna Fáil, then he or she certainly would. I am not a republican; I am an international socialist. My criticism of the Government is that it continued the policies of Fianna Fáil in taking money out of the pockets of citizens in order to pay back debts that were never ours in the first place. We cannot discuss the budget without putting it in the context of the debacle around Irish Water and what is going on in the economy in general. We had a discussion here this morning about the Defence Forces and frightening statistics that 20% of soldiers in the Defence Forces are so poorly paid that they must rely on FIS payments coming out of the Department of Social Protection's budget. In effect, the race to the bottom in terms of wages not only in the private sector, but in the public sector as well, is putting an enormous strain on social protection in order to bring people up to a certain level of decency or baseline. I will not repeat points that have been well articulated. We heard terrible stories of citizens who are in the category of the working poor, and people who are simply sick of managing. People are working harder and longer than they were a number of years ago for less pay. They are being told by the Taoiseach and other members of the Government that the economy is improving, that things are getting better, but they do not feel that is the case. The payment of a new water bill has been foisted onto people's shoulders. I agree with Deputy McGuinness’s point that Irish Water should be abolished and that we should fund water infrastructure through general taxation. I would be more in favour of taxation being increased on high earners and corporations. In the context of budgets and not being able to do enough for people on social protection, it is ironic that we heard this morning the debunking of the myth that the hundreds of millions of euro going into Irish Water will improve conservation. The regulator confirmed statistics showing that the introduction of water charges will not have an impact on water conservation and that the reduction will be approximately 6%. That confirms analysis done previously which showed that the installation of water meters was not an economically viable position, yet the Government and taxpayer are underwriting Irish Water’s investment to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro to facilitate a useless process that will not in any way contribute to water conservation. The reason I posit the argument now is that those hundreds of millions of euro could have been used to repair the water infrastructure, which is necessary, and could also have been used to ease the burden of people on social protection payments. In many cases the contributors to this debate on the Bill deal with not so much as to what it contains, as to what is not in it and what should have been in it. Other Deputies referred to the treatment of carers in the lifetime of the Government, which has been reprehensible. Given that we had greater flexibility in the budget, increased payments together with the restoration of the full respite care grant should have been made to the 40,000 full-time carers. Although the respite care grant is a payment that is supposed to be used to provide people with respite, everybody knows that because of the cumulative cutbacks families have already endured, the grant is not always used for that purpose, but in many instances it is used for essentials such as to pay for heating, electricity and in some cases food, clothes and other such items. Everybody knows stories about families having to sell their cars and not being able to turn on their heating because of the cuts in payments. It is a false economy because the health of carers is then impacted and when they cannot do the job they too will become a cost to the Exchequer, apart from the human cost to those people who play such an important role in society. Another area on which the Minister made great play was the change to the system of supports for one-parent families. She said in 2012 that seven was too young an age to consider removing the one-parent family support and that her goal was to bring us up to Scandinavian models of child care. If the Minister agrees that seven is too young for the payments to stop then why is that the case and where are the measures to bring in affordable child care? Nobody realistically expected the Scandinavian model to be delivered but why not at the least allow for the benefit of tax relief in the budget to off-set child care costs? There was nothing in that regard. Unless the situation is addressed then the poverty endured by one-parent families, who are primarily women, will continue. We should note that Ireland, along with the United States, has the highest child care costs in the world and the highest birth rate in Europe but we are not dealing with the issue or the level of child poverty that exists. Another issue not addressed in the Bill, but one of which the Minister is well aware, relates to pensioners. The pension levy is having an impact on people’s income in their retirement years. Other changes introduced in previous social welfare and pensions Bills under the lifetime of the Government mean that currently measures affecting some pension schemes will have a significant detrimental impact on the livelihood of citizens. I refer in particular to the aviation pension scheme-----

We would all probably agree there is a crisis in funding pension schemes. However, what is not agreed is how one deals with the crisis and who is responsible for it. The Government could introduce measures to address the situation in the context of the Bill. Members of the Opposition will push strongly for changes to the Bill on Committee Stage in order to deal with this inequality. The problem must be addressed because if we do not deal with it under the Bill that will mean in six weeks’ time, in the new year, thousands of existing pensioners will be subjected to a six-week loss in earnings on top of the other cutbacks. Some people on deferred pensions will see a decimation of their livelihood. That is not good enough. This is not the fault of the people concerned so why should they bear the cost? They had a reasonable and legitimate expectation that they would have a certain standard of living on their retirement. Membership of the scheme was a condition of their employment. They could not get out of it and they had no choice in the matter. Through no fault of their own they potentially face their livelihood being decimated, yet their colleagues in the United States and in Britain who also work for the national airline did not have to endure the cut. Too much has been done to protect the employer in this situation and to expect pensioners to bear the cost. We can deal with the issue on Committee Stage. I accept there was a funding problem with the scheme. However, the primary blame for the problem rests on the shoulders of the employers. It is not just me who says that. The High Court has already adjudicated on these matters. Mr. Justice Murphy deemed the Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme to be a contingent creditor in terms of Aer Lingus when the company tried previously to move money around. The court ruled that Aer Lingus owed the pension scheme more than €500 million. What the company is putting into the scheme now as part of the new deal is not a fraction of the money required yet the company is highly profitable and benefitted from the exit of thousands of employees before their normal retirement date. It is now expecting those people to bear the cost for what was a legitimate responsibility on its part.

To put it as mildly and politely as I can, some of the decisions made by those trustees were at best ill-judged, ill-timed and very peculiar. They sold off €1.4 billion of assets as part of a freeze and de-risk strategy at a time when property portfolios were increasing. Properties they sold off at rock bottom prices increased in value very shortly afterwards. Those who paid the price for that are deferred and existing pensioners and those who are still actively contributing to the pension schemes at the moment. That really is not good enough. The reason those groups are being disproportionately impacted upon is because of changes we made to previous legislation. We will be pushing the issue on Committee Stage. It is regrettable that the Government has not done it. I hope the Minister will table amendments in that regard on Committee Stage in order that we can address the issue.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	127	I wish to raise a bread and butter issue with the Tánaiste which has a real impact on the level of disposable income of many people, the 300,000 or so mortgage holders who are paying a variable rate of interest which is way over the odds. The interest rates on variable rate mortgages being charged by banks in Ireland are completely unjustifiable. A person taking out a new mortgage on a variable rate can be paying anything up to 4.5% compared to a euro area average of 2.5%. For example, a person with a mortgage of €200,000, the difference in interest every year is about €4,000, that is over €300 extra per month being paid by an Irish mortgage holder compared to a counterpart in another eurozone country. This is completely unacceptable at a time when the cost of funds for the banks is decreasing, the net interest margin is increasing very significantly and yet the cost of variable rate mortgages is not coming down, with the exception of the very welcome move announced recently by AIB. The ECB rate reductions have not been passed on to variable rate customers and yet the Government appears to be completely uninterested in this issue. Is the Government merely a neutral bystander on this issue? Has the Government a view on the interest rates being charged by banks in respect of variable rate mortgages? Has the Government specifically discussed this issue with the banks and with the Central Bank?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	I will place this issue in context.

Of course we know that at a certain stage the banks stopped offering tracker deals. I am sure Deputy McGrath will be happy to acknowledge that it was very much on his party's watch that when the tracker deals ended the people who came after that period faced variable rates. There are times in financial structures when a fixed rate can militate against borrowers and this has been proved in Irish financial history. There are times when variable rates can offer advantages and disadvantages. The critical point is that the banks should return to normal operational capacities and do what banks should do which is to offer funding and reliable sources of funding to people who have the financial resources and the employment and income structures which will allow them to borrow and to borrow at a reasonable cost rate.  As the Deputy said, the recent move by AIB to bring back competition to the variable rate market is extremely welcome. I hope it is a move by the banks towards a more competitive offering on mortgage costs because this is critical for people.  The banks are working their way through their collapse. The new managing director of PIMCO said at a recent conference in Kilkenny how foolish and misguided was Fianna Fáil's fatally flawed bank guarantee, which he maintains, destroyed the economic capacity of the country. Unfortunately, the banks are still in a recovery situation but I hope that they will now move to more competitive offerings on mortgage charges of all kinds but in particular on interest charges for current borrowers and for those anxious to purchase a family home, of which there are many, thankfully.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	131	The Tánaiste has taken us on an interesting historical tour as she sees it but she avoided the key issue and she avoided answering my direct questions. The cost of funds for the banks today is in the region of 1%. Bank of Ireland has put it on the record that its cost of funds is 1.15% and yet variable rate customers are being charged up to 4.5%. It is exploitative and exorbitant and there is no justification whatsoever for it and it is being presided over by the Tánaiste's Government. Up until recently, Brian Hayes, MEP, was the Minister of State in the Department of Finance but he is now safely ensconced in the European Parliament. He has stated that variable rate customers are being fleeced and yet the Government does not seem to have a view on this issue.  The ECB rate is virtually zero. Anyone with savings will know that the banks are paying little or nothing on deposits. The cost of funds has never been lower and yet the banks are milking it in respect of the profits they are earning on variable rate customers. Both AIB and Bank of Ireland are profitable again so there is no point in the Tánaiste trying to spin that it is all Fianna Fáil's fault; that is nonsense. The banks are profitable, they are accessing money at 1% and they are charging 4.5% and the Tánaiste is standing over this. I asked her direct questions: Does the Government have a view on this? Has the Government discussed this issue directly with the banks? Has the Government discussed this issue with the Central Bank? It would be very helpful if we could have some straight answers.

Hard-pressed families are not looking for a temporary reduction in their bills. Families at risk of poverty, including working families, are not looking for a social welfare payment. In October, 100,000 people marched through Dublin and made this crystal clear. In November, 150,000 people marched throughout the State and made this crystal clear. They are simply not in a position to pay this unjust charge. They are opposed to it and they are telling the Government to scrap it. Instead of listening to the people, the Government is cooking up some half-baked package of measures which it hopes will get it through the next general election. This is not good enough. The Tánaiste claims she wishes to help people so perhaps she can help today. Will she give a commitment that she will not allow unpaid water bills to be deducted at source from people's wages, pensions or social welfare? Will the Tánaiste further confirm she will not allow attachment orders to be used by Irish Water to enforce payment?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	157	The priority of the Government is to offer people, as I have stated in previous discussions, a clear modest affordable charge with regard to Irish Water. We have listened very carefully, unlike at times Sinn Féin, to what people have had to say. We have been working on a package, which my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is finalising. This will provide clarity on the Irish Water framework, which has as its objective the provision of clean safe water to people who live in the country, and which will also enable the future industrial and commercial development of the country so we get people back to work. This is an issue for everybody, whether on a high or low income. In addition, for the first time since the crisis began, I am happy to say we have a budget which will mean that in January and February people will see modest reductions in the universal social charge and income tax, alongside increases in child benefit and a number of other social welfare allowances. We are very cognisant of the fact people have found it very difficult to make ends meet. The budget is a very carefully designed package to provide relief to families and individuals who depend on social protection and social welfare payments, and to families at work, especially those who have told me they would like to see reform and relief and particularly regarding the universal social charge which affects lower-paid workers, about whom the Deputy is speaking, and with regard to taxation. With regard to Irish Water, I have stated previously what I want, which is what we are working on. This is a programme for a very clear package which, I hope, will be with the House by the end of next week, which will provide certainty as to the charges over a long period of time. I stated before, and I say again, that Irish Water was far too ambitious in its timeline for the very large undertaking-----

Leaving aside entirely the fact she is clearly not listening to what people have told her, here is the clarity: people have told her in unprecedented numbers to abolish this charge. That is the message. Let me return, if I might, to the two specific questions I put to the Tánaiste, who is also the Minister for Social Protection. I asked her specifically to give an assurance to the Dáil she will not allow for unpaid bills to be deducted from people's wages, pensions or social welfare. My second question is to confirm she will not allow for attachment orders to be used by Irish Water for unpaid bills. The House will sit next Friday and I understand there will be a vote. I have wondered to myself, and there is some speculation, whether emergency legislation will be presented, perhaps to allow for these very things. Will the Tánaiste put people's minds at rest and make it clear today that she will not allow for deductions of unpaid bills from wages, pensions or social welfare? Will she please address the issue of attachment orders and make it clear she will not allow for the use of such orders by Irish Water in respect of unpaid bills?

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	234	I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned was granted temporary permission to remain in the State in 1999 under the arrangements then applicable to the non-EEA national parents of Irish born citizen children. This permission was renewed on a regular basis by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), with the latest permission granted to him expiring on 26 March, 2014. The person concerned applied to the INIS for renewal of permission to remain in the State on 21 May, 2014. He was requested to provide documentary evidence regarding his financial situation and continuous residence in the State and some documentation was received on 30 September, 2014, including his passport, which on examination showed that he was absent from the State for considerable periods of time. The person concerned was then requested to provide additional documentation and information in regard to his travel outside the State by letter dated 7 October, 2014. To date, no reply has been received. Upon receipt of a response and appropriate documentation, his case will be examined by the relevant officials in INIS and a decision on his future status in the State communicated to him in due course. I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specially established for this purpose. The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary questions process.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that further information was requested by INIS on 29 October from the person mentioned by the Deputy. On receipt of the information requested, the application will be examined in detail. Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited. 

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	237	As the Deputy will be aware, one of the primary functions of the Garda Commissioner under the Garda Síochána Acts, is to direct and control An Garda Síochána. In this regard, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of all resources, including fully sworn members and Reserve Gardaí, among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the full complement of Gardaí, Reserve Gardaí and civilians attached to each Garda Station in the Cavan-Monaghan Division, on the 30 September 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the table below. As you will be aware the first intake since 2009 of 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore on Monday 15 September 2014. This marked a positive step forward for policing in Ireland. Furthermore, as provided for in Budget 2015 the process of recruiting 200 new Gardaí to the force will continue over the next few months. The situation will be kept under review and when these additional personnel next become available the needs of the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country. It is my intention that there will be ongoing recruitment and I am discussing the details of this with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	238	The information requested is being compiled and I will pass it on to the Deputy as soon as possible.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-13 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	239	The provision and allocation of Garda transport is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the light of identified operational circumstances and the availability of resources.  Responsibility for the efficient deployment of Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances. The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet. As a consequence it is not fully practicable to provide a breakdown of Garda vehicles by each individual Garda station. In that context, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda vehicles assigned to the Garda Districts in which the stations referred to are located is 29 and 21 respectively. The Deputy will be aware that I recently secured an additional €10 million for investment in the Garda fleet. This funding will provide for a significant number of new Garda vehicles. In that context, I am advised by the Garda authorities that, to date, an order for 370 new vehicles has been placed. These vehicles will be allocated over the coming months, following fit out, in accordance with the Garda Commissioner's identified operational requirements.
