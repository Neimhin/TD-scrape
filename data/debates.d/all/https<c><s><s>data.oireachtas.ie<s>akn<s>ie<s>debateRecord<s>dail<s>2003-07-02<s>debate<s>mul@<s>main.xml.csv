#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The revelations made known by the Taoiseach to the House yesterday in respect of Mr. Justice Flood's resignation have added greater confusion to the issue, and give the impression that the Taoiseach has misled the House. The Attorney General knew of and attended a meeting on 26 May with two other judges in relation to the costs issue on the pending resignation of Mr. Justice Flood. Did the Attorney General inform the Taoiseach of this meeting and, if so, did that not mean that the Government was then in possession of the information that Mr. Justice Flood intended to resign? Why did the Taoiseach give the impression last week, in answer to a number of parties in the House, that he had only just become aware of this information, and that in his breathless rush to impart that information he did not have time to deal with the legal intricacies of what was contained therein? Does this not mean that the information in regard to Mr. Justice Flood saying he wished and intended to retire as chairman of the tribunal was made known to the Taoiseach and the Government through the Attorney General on 26 May, and by formal letter on 28 May, and that the Taoiseach had this information for a month, and that this House and its Members were not so informed by the Government? Does that not constitute a misleading of the House and the withholding of relevant information about the most historic tribunal of recent times?Can the Taoiseach account for the fact that the Attorney General does not appear to have brought this information to his attention, or, if he did so, that the Taoiseach did not make the House aware of it? Why did the Taoiseach give the impression last Tuesday that he had not become aware of this information until the Cabinet meeting earlier that morning? Does it not mean that the Taoiseach's handling of this issue has been confused, and that he has misled Dáil Éireann?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I have given all details on all issues. That is why, last week, shortly after we had for the first time discussed the legal issues with the Cabinet, I raised another question involving a different tribunal. In my view, that was the right thing to do. In response to Deputy Kenny's questions, the information I gave yesterday did not cause confusion, but contained the full facts of all of the letters. I could have argued that some of them should perhaps not have been released, but I issued all of them, and I thought that was extremely helpful. At every turn and twist of this matter over the last week or ten days, I have given, either to this House or to the media, the facts as they have moved on.Deputy Kenny asked me if I was aware of the Attorney General's meeting and of the letter he received. The answer is "yes". I was so aware. I was informed by the Attorney General that he had had a meeting with the tribunal and was expecting a letter from it. I received a copy of that letter on 29 May and passed it to the Secretary General of my Department. However, on 30 May I was made aware of the fact that after discussions between the Attorney General and a member of the tribunal's legal team, the Attorney General was requested not to circulate the letter of 28 May to the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	5	This request was made because of a legal error on page one of the letter in relation to a query from the Attorney General as to whether the letter itself was to be copied to the Clerks. The Government was simply complying with the request of the tribunal not to circulate the letter of 28 May.The media have already examined this matter, and I suggest the Members of this House might also do so. They will see that letters from the tribunal are always either marked as being circulated to the Clerks of the Dáil or the Seanad, or else contain a request for the letter to be circulated. In this case, the tribunal initially asked that the letter be circulated, following which a member of the tribunal's legal team discussed the matter with the Attorney General and requested that the letter not be circulated.I resent the suggestions that I have in any way misled the Dáil on this or any other aspect.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I do not want to get involved in a blow by blow account of dealings with the tribunal's legal team. While that might not be right for me, I cannot take a position of certainty when people were in a state of flux for whatever reason – I might know those reasons but do not want to go into them. I almost went out and did a press conference in Cork last week, after I had been informed that Mr. Justice Flood had changed his mind, that he was going to deal with the costs as requested by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and was going to stay on for another two years.I was within ten minutes of doing a press conference when I got a call from the Attorney General to say that position had changed. I do not want to go into that either, because I spelt out those facts yesterday. However, I will not take the allegation that I misled anybody on this issue. In fact I have been totally upfront on it. Deputy Kenny did not say it in a very strong way, and I appreciate that, but I will not leave it on the record of the House. While the Deputy is entitled to ask questions, in no way have I misled the House. If I were to give a blow by blow account, I would be here answering questions this morning about trying to undermine the tribunal in some way and I am not going to do that either.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Does this not mean that all the mishandling of the past month has resulted in Mr. Justice Flood having hardened his attitude to the point where the taxpayer could now be exposed to very serious amounts of money in respect of the costs of those who were deemed to have obstructed the hearings of the tribunal? The Taoiseach says he has been open and upfront on all matters concerning this. I have copies of the letters between Mr. Justice Flood and the Attorney General, which were circulated last evening to journalists. The leaders of the Opposition parties got no copies of this correspondence. How can the Taoiseach say that he has been open and upfront in all the details of this matter with the Opposition parties and Members of the Dáil?

We are now told by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that the legislation to deal with the future elements of the costings of this tribunal are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is not here.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Is the Taoiseach perfectly happy that there is no impediment preventing the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform bringing forward these proposals? If he has known about this for the past month, why was the legislation not prepared by now so that it could be dealt with before the House rises tomorrow? This is the last occasion on which the Taoiseach will be present in the House until the autumn session, as he has made arrangements not to be here on Thursdays. He should deal with those elements of his confused mishandling of this matter over the past month.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I will not go back over the issue of confused mishandling. In the House last week I said: "I am not a legal expert but it has been pointed out to me by many of my legal colleagues that this opens up many issues, which it is probably not appropriate for me to go into now."  I also said: "I have not had an opportunity to study all the legalities in the few hours since I have been made aware of these issues."  At last Tuesday morning's Cabinet meeting for the first time I was made aware in a detailed way of all the legal issues.

Last week that discussion was brought to the Cabinet in a preliminary way. By Friday we had a detailed legal opinion, which I mentioned at a press briefing outside the House and which I mentioned inside the House yesterday. That legal advice is to the effect that they are quite happy that the legislation can be dealt with.

I apologise to Deputy Kenny if the letters were not given to him. They should have been. If they were given to the media they should have been given to the Opposition Leaders.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	20	As I said yesterday on the Order of Business, I had instructed that they should be circulated. Some other questions came up and if I do not get a chance to put them on the record, I will also circulate those replies.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	21	On this matter, the Taoiseach told the House on 24 June in a pre-prepared statement: "I have not had an opportunity to study all the legalities in the few hours since I have been made aware of these issues."  He has now told Deputy Kenny that there was a meeting on 26 May arising from which there was a letter written to the Attorney General on 28 May, which the Taoiseach has said he saw on 29 May. He said it was not put into the public domain because there was a letter on 30 May requesting that it not be put in the public domain because the writer was going on holidays.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	22	It might be helpful to clarify that I am not saying that. I am saying that the member of the legal team had a verbal discussion with the Attorney General stating that because of the legal error and the other reason I have stated he did not think it should be put into the public domain. The Attorney General then wrote to get confirmation of that, but it was done almost immediately by the legal team. That is what I am saying.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	23	However, there was no such impediment on 24 June when the Taoiseach answered questions here. Why did he not tell the House on 24 June about these meetings and the transfer of this correspondence? There was no debarment on doing so then. The letter of 16 June released the Taoiseach from that. That letter made clear that Mr. Justice Flood wanted the information brought to the attention of this House through the clerks, but the Taoiseach made no reference to meetings, contacts from legal personnel at the tribunal or the existence of letters. Deputy Kenny has asked if that is not misleading the House and the Taoiseach still has to deal with that issue.On 11 June, my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, asking whether in the light of media speculation any changes were planned in the Flood tribunal. The Minister stated this was not the case. That was on 11 June, which was long after these discussions had been initiated and long after the letter of 28 May had been transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, at the same time as it was transferred to the Taoiseach.

He was almost going to give this press conference just as he was almost going to give us information, but he almost did not quite get around to it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I did not say that.

What is the situation?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	36	On that issue, I have answered the first point. I did not want to refer to what was in effect a non-letter from the tribunal and therefore be blamed and accused of not co-operating with the tribunal. I abide strictly by the rule in dealing with the tribunal. In the past few weeks there have been issues within the tribunal and I followed this strictly. They said further letters would be required and asked that that letter not be circulated and the letter of 16 June became the effective letter. I stuck firmly to the rule in dealing with the tribunal. I am answering Deputy Rabbitte's question at the moment. I will answer other Deputies' questions during Question Time.On the second question as to why the Government sought to have Mr. Justice Flood remain as the chairperson and whether we wanted him to deal with the issue of fees, there is a simple explanation. If Mr. Justice Flood remained as chairperson and decided the costs issue, there would be no grounds for any challenge. That is why we wanted him to deal with the issue of costs, as I stated here after the Cabinet discussed the legal issues for the first time last Tuesday week.However, recognising Mr. Justice Flood's concern about the added burden and strain on him, we were willing to take additional legislative steps. They were the passing of legislation to allow the administrative burden of the tribunal to be delegated to another member, which was offered by the Attorney General. This was clearly a cause of concern to Mr. Justice Flood as is obvious from his correspondence. However, the proposal that this change would take place and Mr. Justice Flood would continue on as chairperson was overtaken by the event of his resignation last Friday. That is the situation in which we find ourselves. It is not of our making but we must react to it in a manner that we see fit to protect the public interest and to ensure the taxpayer does not have to carry the cost of the tribunal. I am satisfied that we will be able to address this issue through legislation. While we cannot eliminate the risk of people suing, we will do our best to ensure they will not be successful.On Deputy Rabbitte's last question about the press conference in Cork, I do not want to make much of this or get into any conflict with the legal team or anyone else. I was informed last Thursday evening that Mr. Justice Flood had called to the Attorney General. He said a number of things that would not be fair or right for me to say in the House. However, he made it clear that his position on Thursday evening was that he had thought about the matter and was prepared to continue chairing the tribunal. He was also prepared to continue to deal with the costs and go on for another two years. He left to return to the tribunal to write a letter stating that was his intention. Circumstances changed and he telephoned back to say he wanted to think about it overnight and subsequently changed his position.

Those are the very issues the Taoiseach says he learned of a few hours before he addressed the House on 24 June. That is the difference between 28 May and 16 June. Mr. Justice Flood gave it as his opinion that he could easily be replaced by another judge and decide the costs issues. There is a dissertation in the 28 May letter on that. The Taoiseach says he only heard about it a few hours earlier.Is there anything else the Taoiseach wants to tell the House about this entire affair that we do not have to extract from him on a drip-feed basis? The tribunal is a creature of the Oireachtas. The Taoiseach is asking us to do something – I am not clear what he is asking us to do – but he is only drip-feeding information to us as it is extracted from him.He has not explained why the letter of 28 May is date-stamped in the office of the Attorney General as having been received—

Yet, it is date-stamped in an office that caused the fall of a previous Government as having been received on 6 June.Is there anything else the Taoiseach wants to tell us? Is the Taoiseach trying to get the costs of tribunals under control? After this morning's tragedy in Crumlin Hospital, most Members of the House would agree with that objective. Why does the Taoiseach not tell us if that is the objective rather than telling us bit by bit what is passed on about this matter?

I do not need that kind of lecturing from Deputy Rabbitte.On the issue of the letter of 28 May and why was it received in the Office of the Attorney General on that date, the letter was for the personal attention of the Attorney General. It was an important letter. The date stamp signifies the date the letter is received in a section of the Attorney General's office called the registry. The letter was given by the Attorney General to an official on 5 June. At that stage, the letter, which had been dealt with by the Attorney General's private office, was sent to the registry and was date-stamped on 6 June when it was received. I will give the remaining replies to the Opposition and the press.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	54	In raising the same matter, I wish Mr. Justice Mahon and his colleagues well in the task ahead of them. I thank Mr. Justice Flood for his work on the tribunal. I also wish to thank him for his work as chairman on the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which cleared the way for the disability Bill. Perhaps the Government will ensure that his legacy is put in place with the disability Bill soon as it is already long overdue.Was Mr. Justice Flood pushed or did he jump? Has the Taoiseach learned any lessons to date from the Flood tribunal? Has the report by Mr. Justice Flood been taken on board? The fact remains that if one is associated with Fianna Fáil it helps one to get ahead, even more so if one is corrupt.

I am not talking about former Government press secretary, Mr. Frank Dunlop, in that association. The Taoiseach should also apologise to me because he did not indicate to me that he had a meeting on 26 May.Are there three trays on the Taoiseach's desk – one in-tray, one out-tray and one tribunal correspondence tray? In June 2001, the Taoiseach received a letter from the tribunal requesting help. However, there was a delay in getting back to it on the matter. In January 2002, there was another similar letter. I can understand how Mr. Justice Flood could have been deeply frustrated, not just by the delay in getting correspondence, but also by the mounting costs as those delays continued to impact on the work of the tribunal. Does the Taoiseach accept any responsibility for having wasted taxpayers' money by prolonging the delay in his replies to the tribunal? The tribunal could have handled matters better if it had the resources earlier.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	57	To correct the Deputy, I had no meeting with the legal team or Mr. Justice Flood.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	58	He did not tell us.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I said that I knew about it. The Deputy's indication is that in some way we frustrated Mr. Justice Flood. I will again put on the record the letter from Mr. Justice Flood in which he refers to correspondence with the Attorney General and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, on his resignation and the reasons underlying it:I note in the public press and now in the House the vexative statement that action-inaction by the Government in relation to requests from the tribunal for additional judges and other matters has caused frustration and the real issue for my resignation. I wish to state categorically that this is not so. My decision is in no way related to or consequent upon any action-inaction of the Government of any kind. My relation with the Government is through the Department of the Attorney General. I have at all times during my tenure in office had a relationship with the Attorney General's Office which has been exceptionally cordial and co-operative. The allegations that the work of the tribunal has been delayed or frustrated, in any way, by the Government is completely groundless and is nothing to do with my decision to resign. My reasons for resignation are solely set out in correspondence with the Attorney [General] and Minister Cullen. I trust this clarifies the matter. Signed: Feargus M. Flood.With regard to the lessons learned from the tribunal, I led the last Government that brought in the most legislation since the foundation of the State – rightly so – to deal with all of the issues surrounding corruption, planning and ethics.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I listened carefully to what the Taoiseach said. I do not recall him saying that Mr. Justice Flood was not frustrated. He may have been giving various reasons as to why he resigned. It is what he is not saying that is also interesting. Does the Taoiseach accept that the Oireachtas has a particular interest in this matter, given that it is one of the few opportunities we have to bring about change rather than talk about something or ask the Government to do something about it? For that reason, the setting up of the tribunals by the Oireachtas is of particular interest.Does the Taoiseach further accept that the Government has a job to take action beyond that, and that the kind of action that is needed, aside from the various legislative measures that the Government has introduced, which I acknowledge, still misses the point that temptation, corruption and greed are still endemic in the planning process? Does the Taoiseach accept the fact that the Government continues to guarantee that windfall profits from land owners and land speculators accrue not to the community but to—

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I am dealing specifically with the Flood tribunal and the lessons arising. If we do not learn from it then we are wasting taxpayers' money. On that basis, I asked the Taoiseach whether he would remove the corrupting influence of gross profiteering from land rezoning by, for example, taking on board the ideas – whatever about the legislation – proposed in the recent Green Party sponsored Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2003?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	64	That is the way to tackle corruption because it removes the temptation to profiteer with unwise rezoning. Will the Government act on this?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	65	On the general point, I am sure there will be ongoing recommendations coming from the reports on which the Government will act. I have always stated that. Whether it was in regard to the conclusions of Mr. Justice McCracken or issues in regard to the Moriarty or Flood tribunals, the Government has already introduced legislative measures. I accept that legislation can always be improved upon.The Deputy made a reference in his first question to what I did not say.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Not to what he did not say.

He specifically mentioned, as he did on two previous occasions, the appointment of judges. I wish to refer to a letter of 15 May 2002 from John Gallagher, the senior counsel to the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments to the deputy director of the Office of the Attorney General. The letter stated:As I indicated on the telephone my view which is shared by Mr. Justice Flood is that the instrument should not be made until after Mr. Justice Flood has submitted his interim report to the Oireachtas. I will communicate with you in due course in relation to the operative date for the new instrument and in the meantime would ask that you communicate with the Department concerned to ensure that the amending instrument is not signed until after its agreement with the sole member as to the operative date.There was no delay on the part of the Government. I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to kill that one because I also saw that in the newspapers.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	69	That was mentioned in the newspapers and it was never the intention of the Government to do other than co-operate fully.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I am pleased to be able to answer these questions and I hope that I have responded to the issues that were raised.In the House yesterday people said that the big issue in the weekend newspapers was that Mr. Justice Flood had been frustrated by the Government. Since I answered that one, they have moved on to another issue. I have tried to answer all these issues as best I can in the limited time available.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.No direct costs arose in my Department since January 2003 in respect of the working group on basic income. The group completed its work in March 2001.The working group examined the broad implications of the introduction of a basic income and this work contributed to the development of the Green Paper on Basic Income which was published in September 2002. Costs relating to the printing and translation of the Green Paper fell to be paid in 2003. These were €6,296 and €2,244, respectively.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	73	What is the future agenda planned for the working group? Has it finished its reports, or are further reports outstanding? Is there a working agenda for the group for the period ahead?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	74	The work on my end of the matter is finished. The Department of Social and Family Affairs will look it at further, as will the Department of Finance. The primary aim of the Green Paper is to bring the issues to the attention of the wider community. I am aware that there is ongoing debate on this matter. CORI has been very much at the centre of this issue, as have others. The Green Paper is encouraging debate on the many issues involved. People have already submitted papers in respect of some of the issues. The focus of the debate is the structure and implementation of tax and social welfare policies to increase the prospects of achieving the benefits of basic income. It is primarily now an issue for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance to examine at a departmental level.I am conscious that there are also other outside interests. Opinion is already varied on the merits of the concept. The debate on the basic income scheme and the information this has generated at least provides for a more informed debate than was, heretofore, the case. As I said before, I will keep in touch with CORI in regard to the debate.

The Taoiseach undertook to indicate when the report would be published. Is he now in a position to give us that information?If I heard the Taoiseach right, he said that he, personally, believed the basic income system was workable. On foot of the various cutbacks in community employment schemes, job initiative schemes, back to work, enterprise allowance, social economy programme, even the county enterprise boards-—

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	79	As regards those costs, a Cheann Comhairle, is the Taoiseach prepared to act on his belief that guaranteed basic income is workable in light of the evidence which seems to be going in the opposite direction? Will he deal with that matter, given the EUROSTAT findings that we have achieved only 60% of the EU average on our levels of social protection expenditure, and that we have the greatest wealth disparity in the EU? Will he act on that fact—

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	81	—and make sure that guaranteed basic income is not just workable but worked?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	82	In reply to the first question, the taxation and budgetary group in the Department of Finance is the group that will take this into account. I did highlight that. There are probably more questions in respect of welfare issues. Those who have an interest in the matter from a welfare point of view have made most of the responses, of which the Department of Social and Family Affairs should take account.I do not wish to go back through all of the issues that I did before. I think they are all included in the Green Paper. Some people think this is totally unworkable but that was also the case when we changed our taxation system some years ago to make it more targeted. Although some people did not believe that was possible, it proved to be most effective and people now acknowledge that we have been able to target the less well-off.We have put five or six hard years of work into it and it should be examined at the very least. Even some of its proponents see that there are difficulties with the original thinking, following the studies that were done by the various experts. That is to be expected but I think it is worth continuing to look at it.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Is there a date for the report?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	84	No, but that tax group is now set up and it normally works from this time of the year right through to the budget.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	85	We are all aware of the difficulties that relate to the concept of a basic income and its working out. I recall having discussions with the Taoiseach during the Labour-Fianna Fáil Administration. I think a working group produced a report then which has stood the test of time.The primary groups which have failed to be assisted to the level which they deserve, by whatever mechanism one would choose to use, are, first, families with children on lower income, because as the Taoiseach is aware, the child dependant allowance has essentially stayed frozen down the years and, second, older couples where—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Without getting into the detail, I am sure the Deputy is aware of the recent study by the OECD which shows where this country is placed. I am not saying everything has been resolved, but it shows this country in terms of the groups the Deputy mentioned – younger people, not older people – is the best of the OECD countries.

I am sure she remembers the debate which concluded that the position we adopted in terms of child benefit was the fairest to people on the lowest incomes. It was not the best for people on the highest incomes, but that was the reason we made that decision. There are some aspects which should be followed in the groups. It may not be possible to implement the overall paper within one group, but there are good suggestions to be taken forward.

This has been strung out over several years and repeated questions have been asked at set intervals, yet all we get trundled out are the same old hackneyed answers. Would it not be better to be open and frank with the House and to redirect whatever resources and personnel to look at the essential need for fundamental tax reform given that one in three PAYE workers are still paying tax at the higher tax rate, despite the Taoiseach's commitment to reduce it to one in five?

In that context, I refer to the support given to the previous Administration I was privileged to lead by the Independent Fianna Fáil organisation in the constituency of Donegal North-East represented in the 28th Dáil by Harry Blaney and in the current Dáil by Deputy Blaney.As regards the current Administration, the support of Deputies Healy-Rae, Fox and Blaney is not as critical to the Government's majority, given the support they have provided in the past. However, I have tried and will continue to try to be as helpful as possible to these Deputies. A staff member in my office assists the Government Chief Whip's office in its work in liasing with these Deputies. This official meets these Deputies on a regular basis and arranges to keep them briefed on issues as they arise. In addition, Deputy Gregory is invited to the Whips' meetings each week which he regularly attends.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I know it is almost the silly season, but it appears to make a mockery of the equality of elected representatives here to represent the people given that the Government is giving specific and direct support to named individual Deputies. Surely everyone under the Constitution should be equal in terms of their representation here? What type of invaluable support did Deputies Healy-Rae and Fox give the previous Administration which the Taoiseach had the honour to lead?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Who is the staff member in the Taoiseach's office who liaises with the Government Chief Whip's office about these matters? How often do they meet?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	127	All danger and temptation.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Am I to understand that officials from the Department of the Taoiseach were dispatched to Kerry on various occasions not just to consult Deputy Healy-Rae but his son and to walk the beaches and the roads while discussing events in general? I understand he offered advice to the Taoiseach in a threatening manner and said that he should have his bicycle chain oiled up at all times. Does that not represent an insurance policy paid for by the taxpayer in the event of the Taoiseach having an unhappy relationship with the Progressive Democrats?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	129	We do not complain about the way the Deputy manages his Independents.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	130	It makes a mockery of the good use of civil servants for them to have to consult and liaise with named Independent Deputies as an insurance policy for the future in case the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, for example, has an eruption in Government and has to leave. That is what it represents.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The Deputy is being repetitive.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I remember being here in January 1982 and I learned from watching a previous leader of the Deputy's party how not to handle Independents. I have not forgotten it. In light of the last Government, I decided to learn the lesson. I appreciate the fact that the Deputy's party taught me the lesson.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	133	The Deputy should ask a question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I recommended that former Deputy Rockall Loftus should have been taken aside and tutored in that Government, but that did not happen. Is the Taoiseach allocating valuable Civil Service time to politically massage certain Independents so that they will remain sweet and in tune if the Government needs them? This came to a point a number of months ago when some of the Independent Deputies said "get ready, we're going to be called back into the front line again". As regards the waste of Civil Service time, given that civil servants have a job to do in the public service, does the Taoiseach believe they are properly employed when they travel on a weekly basis to meet and consult named Independent Deputies?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	135	It is not done on a weekly basis.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	136	As a result of their representations, has the Taoiseach made individual Government decisions, which affect them in their constituencies, to keep them sweet?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	137	As I pointed out, there was regular contact between the Government Chief Whip and the Independents in the previous Dáil for good reasons in relation to the numerical issue. That is not the case now. The contact is not as frequent. However, these and other Deputies look for assistance on different matters and we always try to deal with them. Government decisions are not made on that basis. The Deputies I dealt with in the last Dáil were totally realistic about what a backbench Deputy could or could not get. They did not look for totally unrealistic things.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Will the Taoiseach extend the same facility to Members on this side of the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I do that all the time but usually people ask me to do something or other. One of the Fine Gael Members yesterday asked me to meet a whole delegation of people from his constituency, which I did, and they are very nice people.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	143	It is breaking out because of the informal meetings held by the Government with Deputies Fox, Healy-Rae and Blaney. Deputy Fox says the Government does this as a courtesy. If it is just courtesy, has the Government a problem with being courteous to other Independent Deputies, whatever about anybody else who is not in the Government?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	144	It is a two-way street.

How informal are the meetings? Is there a particular game-plan on either side of the table of which the Taoiseach is aware?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	146	In the last Dáil there were weekly meetings attended by the Government Whip and, regularly, the Minister with responsibility for an issue before the House. We try to assist the Deputies with some of the bigger issues, for example in terms of getting replies more quickly from Departments, but that happens less frequently now. I have no problem with helping other Deputies and I have already confirmed to Deputy Sargent that I have arranged a meeting about his office accommodation.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I thank the Taoiseach.

What has been the price of these lessons for the taxpayer? Is there a civil servant devoted full time to servicing these Independent Deputies? Are Deputies James Breen and McHugh on the inside or the outside of this loop?

Is this not excessively cautious? There is no sign of this happening.

It is very unlikely that the Government will get a puncture. Why are we spending taxpayers' money in mollycoddling selected Independent Deputies when there is no necessity for it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I was talking about the arrangements during the last Dáil. The position is less formal now – it is part an individual's job. As I said, other Deputies contact us from time to time, some of them Independent Deputies, although they may not be in contact as frequently as those who supported the Government throughout the last Dáil – they do not always vote with the Government in this Dáil, but do so on a regular basis. I do not want to say who is within the Government's sights, although until Deputy Rabbitte was given his present job last October, he moved around so much that he was always within my sights, but I mention Deputy O'Connor.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I have a supplementary that could have come from the Taoiseach's side of the House. It concerns the frequent coincidence of Deputy Healy-Rae welcoming various announcements in respect of south Kerry, sometimes slightly ahead of the official announcement of the Minister for Arts—
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	157	And tourism.

It is easy to be nice when they are outside the jurisdiction, but many of the people he faces here offer a very different prospect.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	173	My office had a meeting with Councillor Nicky Keogh on Monday.

Is it not the case that the other side of the coin of the Government's special relationship with certain Deputies is that, for Opposition Deputies, particularly those from certain constituencies, there is a structured unhelpfulness from certain Ministries? This is the reality faced by many on the Opposition benches – I am not the only one who has observed this.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	180	We have been on that side of the House too.

As the Taoiseach is willing to confirm the existence of a special relationship in a positive sense, perhaps he would also confirm the reality that it also applies in the negative to certain Members of the House.

Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify for the record that I attend the Whips' meetings each week as Whip of the 22-member Technical Group and I am there as of right. I am invited in the same way as Deputy Durkan or Deputy Stagg is invited – under Standing Orders. It has nothing to do with anything else.

As I understand it, the Technical Group is made up of a number of groups so it should have one member attending. Does the Deputy attend in addition to representatives of the Green Party? Under the long-established rule of this House, only one Deputy can attend from that group. Either Deputy Gregory or a member of the Green Party is invited – they can work that one out among themselves.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I know Question Time is not for me, but may I just reply to the Taoiseach?

Do the detached Independents have the benefit of the Government's spin doctors? It is important to have the benefit of the Government's spin doctors. Maybe the Taoiseach will be able to elucidate further.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	222	On a serious note, if one expects Independents who are not part of a party structure to go along with the Government side and vote for a Bill – it has not arisen much in this Dáil but it did during the last Dáil – one has to explain the merits of and reasons for the legislation.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	224	One cannot expect such people to support a proposal without such an explanation since they have not had the benefit of attending a parliamentary party meeting where legislation is outlined by the relevant Minister. Therefore, a Minister or Minister of State will attend such meetings to explain forthcoming legislation. It is not as relevant in this Dáil but it happened on a weekly basis during the last Dáil.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	225	It is happening now.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive, together.The Government Press Office and Government Information Service provide an information service on Government policy to the public through the national and international media on behalf of myself, my Department and the Government. They also promote a co-ordinated approach to media matters across all Departments.The Government Press Office issues press releases and speeches to the media, briefs political correspondents, organises photo-calls, information campaigns and ministerial representation on current affairs programmes. The Government Press Office also disseminates information to the domestic and international media on the web and via e-mail.The Government Press Office and the Government Information Service, in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs, organise and manage the media aspects of State visits and major State occasions. Staff of the Government Press Office and departmental press officers are available after hours and at weekends to answer media queries.The budget for the Government Press Office last year was €522,011.33 and to date in 2003 is €203,759.76. The budget for the Government Information Service in 2002 was €373,271.60 and to date in 2003 is €114,195.39. These figures include administrative costs, salaries, advertising, photography, travel and subsistence.No new instructions have been given to the Government Press Office or the Government Information Service as to the circumstances in which I will accept questions from members of the media at functions or events. Due to the growth in the number of broadcast media attending public engagements, it was necessary to purchase a microphone stand, which provides all broadcasters with a platform on which to put their microphones for ease of access and recording. Two such stands were purchased by the Government Press Office at a total cost of €80. The duty press officer brings the stand to public engagements to which the media are invited.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	227	One reads that new instructions have been given to these people to the effect that, from now on, the Taoiseach will be more aloof and less accessible. Is there any truth in that? What is the point of this organisation being there to communicate information when, for example, it convened a lavish press conference where no questions were to be put by members of the media? When there was a dispute, however, three or four questions were permitted.A few weeks ago, I recall accidentally stumbling on a situation during one or other controversy involving the Government, where a journalist was berated by a member of this general information service for door-stepping Ministers on their way into Cabinet meetings. I happened to overhear the journalist being told in no uncertain fashion that that would not be acceptable any more.May I ask the Taoiseach if the aeroplane flying over Croke Park, with a sign saying "Well done, Bertie", was a creature of the Government Information Service? Does he have any idea from where the aeroplane took off, who is behind it, who paid for it or what it was about?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The White House.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	229	The only change involves the microphone stand, which is a purely technical matter. Deputy Rabbitte will understand that it is to avoid having microphones all over the place, with arguments and pushing among individual journalists. The stand brings a bit of order to that situation. I am still trying to take the Deputy's advice to convince the media that when I do all these question and answer sessions, they should play back the whole ten or 15 minutes I spend speaking. The Deputy has the frustration of having to listen to me for 30 seconds but I suffer the frustration of having to speak for 15 minutes, yet I only get 30 seconds on air. If the Deputy can help me with that matter I would be very grateful.I know absolutely nothing about the aeroplane over Croke Park, good, bad or indifferent. As regards what happened at the press conference for the launch of the programme for Government, in previous years the document was given out at a photo-call. This year, however, that message was not communicated and some journalists had turned up who obviously had no interest in a photo-call. As soon as I heard that, I agreed to take questions. That is how it happened.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	230	We cannot have a situation where unidentified aircraft are flying over our cities with the Taoiseach's name hanging out the back. The airline industry is one of the most regulated in the world and the same standards apply to it in this country as anywhere else.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The question might be more appropriate to the Minister for Transport.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	234	Is the question related to the five questions before us?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	235	The question relates to the Government Information Service or the Government Press Office. Any aircraft, such as the one referred to last Sunday, has to file a flight path and must have permission to overfly a populated area like Dublin, including Croke Park.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	236	The Deputy should put a question appropriate to the five preceding questions. This matter does not arise from those questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Is it not in the Taoiseach's interest to find out from where this aircraft came and who authorised it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	238	It would be a good idea.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	240	Who filed the flight path and who sought permission for it?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I am calling Deputy Joe Higgins.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	243	It would.

He had to go on the airwaves this morning to defend the Taoiseach.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	245	And we are not even in NATO.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Deputy Kenny, you have gone ahead of us to questions for the Minister for Transport. We are dealing with questions to the Taoiseach about the Government Press Office.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Deputy Kenny has raised a pertinent point. As regards flying Bertie's name over Croke Park, is it not the role of the Government Press Office to be aware of any such thing being planned by a constituency colleague down in Inisvickillane for example?
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	248	In that case, it would not be his name flying out the back of the aeroplane.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	249	If that is the case, is there not a need to clarify the instructions to the Government Press Office in such situations? It certainly has not indicated whether or not it condones or criticises such flights. When the Taoiseach appeared with Deputy Harney, questions were not initially sought until he stood up to take them. Is there an individual in the press office whose role it is to tell the Taoiseach whether or not to answer questions, or is that a matter for the Fianna Fáil Party spin masters? Would there be a conflict of interest in the Government's chief press officer telling the Taoiseach what to do when the questions relate to his own party?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Normally, whenever I attend Government functions, the Government Press Office regulates them. Government press officers are not in attendance at Fianna Fáil functions, where Fianna Fáil press officers deal with the Taoiseach.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	251	At Government functions the Taoiseach is speaking about Fianna Fáil's performance.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	252	Please allow the Taoiseach to reply.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	253	That has been the long-standing practice and there are clear demarcation lines between the Taoiseach and a party leader. That practice is followed very strictly by my Department.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	254	In my role as Head of Government and in accordance with normal practice, I have announced major projects which have been approved by the Government on the initiative of Ministers. In relation to my own Department, the eCabinet project was announced in February 2002. The eCabinet project will deploy information society technologies in support of the Cabinet process to facilitate greater efficiencies in the operation of Cabinet.A feasibility study conducted by consultants PWC, published in February 2002, recommended proceeding with the project. The study gave an indicative estimate of cost of the order of €3.4 million, exclusive of VAT, for the central Cabinet secretariat element of the project, with additional costs liable to be incurred, for example in developing an appropriate security architecture and in implementation of the project in individual Departments.The study drew attention to the fact that features of the system can be used to support a range of other Government initiatives. The project is at an advanced stage and present indications are that it may be delivered significantly below those projected costs.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	255	The Government held a meeting at Farmleigh House some time ago to deal with the issue of competitiveness. Does the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, not feel that because of the country's lack of a competitive edge, he and his Department should show real leadership by putting the governance of the country on a world-class footing in terms of the use and purchase of technology so that there is equality of access to high speed broadband and Internet technologies throughout the State to make us competitive? Will he show leadership by having Government involve itself as the main player so that every facility and unit can avail of the principal access because Ireland is slipping seriously in the ratings?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I dealt with the competitiveness issue earlier. However, there are issues relating to conditions, salaries, costs and so on. The House is dealing with the issue on an all-party basis, which is equally important because the Government has spent a great deal of time on the competitiveness issue.Information society policy comes under my Department's remit and it is the special responsibility of the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Hanafin. The broadband and eGovernment projects are also driven by my Department. They are linked to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, where the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is responsible for the roll-out of broadband in the 19 locations and early planning in 123 other locations. That work is ongoing and, while I will not go into the broadband issue, a number of initiatives, plans and programmes have been spelt out in the eGovernment project and the recent report.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the division of responsibility in regard to the information society whereby one Ministry is responsible for the roll-out the hardware and his Ministry is responsible for promotion of use? Is this division, which he has created, not a source of incoherence?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	258	My Department co-ordinates all aspects to the best of its ability and the teams which make up the Information Society Commission examine future plans, policies and roles. Their work not only relates to broadband, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, but it also feeds into education and other areas. It is important that the central plan should be driven by my Department. Deputy Bruton will be aware that is where the people who volunteer their time to formulate policy want it to be driven, but a number of Departments are involved. The Department of Finance is involved through the public services. It is not the case that only one Department is involved but my Department plays a co-ordinating role.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Does the Taoiseach agree with the old adage that everybody's business is nobody's business?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	260	Broadband technology is a significant part of the programme but it must be based in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources because its agencies, infrastructure and contacts with telecommunications companies are needed. I do not have the resources or numbers to drive that. The same applies in the Department of Education and Science, which has developed a programme to bring technology further into the education system and that is being driven by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, but it is co-ordinated by my Department. At least five Ministers are directly involved in technology development.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	261	That is what the Taoiseach might on another occasion have described as waffle.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 19, inclusive, together.The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion last met on 25 June 2003 and is scheduled to meet again on 23 July 2003. I cannot answer supplementary questions that relate to information or work that is internal to Cabinet. The other questions that normally come up on this issue are tabled to the Minister responsible.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I thank the party leaders for allowing me to attend the meeting with Prime Minister Blair. However, I wish to mention one issue.Liam Fitzgibbon, the Editor of Debates in Leinster House, is retiring today and I will not get an opportunity on the Order of Business to raise this. He has worked here for longer than I have been a Member. He has been in the House for more than three decades and he has been Editor of Debates since 1996. He is well known and highly respected by all Members and staff alike. I congratulate him on his more than 30 years service to the House in a difficult job and I wish him well in his retirement.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I endorse the Taoiseach's words in respect of Mr. Fitzgibbon. He has always treated every Member equally and with extreme courtesy. He has done a fabulous job and has overseen real change in the Debates Office from the days when the old bound volumes had to be typed and transcribed through to the introduction of electronic media and the presentation of the debates using modern technology. I thank him for his wonderful public service over three decades and I wish him well in whatever future role he adopts.I do not expect the Taoiseach to be back in the House until the autumn and, while we have our jousts in the House, I wish him well in his endeavours with Prime Minister Blair so that the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in full can be brought forward. Hopefully, a conclusion can be reached on election dates and we can get on with the business of bringing to a conclusion that for which everybody over the past number of years in all Governments has worked so hard.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I have long been a great admirer of the work of Liam Fitzgibbon and his tremendous staff. He has been a conscientious and diligent public servant for many years, doing an important job in the House. He has in that time modernised the approach towards producing the Official Report. He has always, as Deputy Kenny remarked, been most helpful in times of conflict in the House to all Members during his tenure, not only as Editor of Debates but prior to that. I join the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny in acknowledging the contribution he has made to public service and wish him well in his retirement.I wish the Taoiseach well in his endeavours in London later.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	266	On behalf of the Green Party, I pay tribute to the work of Liam Fitzgibbon. Throughout many years he has served many Members and the House in general. As he retires, we wish good health and happiness.Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis chomh maith as ucht na seirbhíse an-mhaith a thug sé do no daoine a labharann as Gaeilge agus as Béarla agus go raibh gach rud cruinn agus beacht. Go minic bhí sé, agus bíonn sé, deacair gach duine a chluinstin i gceart agus tá an-éacht déanta aige sa tslí is gur féidir leis cur síos a dhéanamh ar rudaí a dúradh sa Dáil agus sa Seanad. I wish him well.It is regrettable that we will not have the opportunity to question the Taoiseach for another while. Whatever he thinks, it is a matter of regret on this side of the House. I wish him well in his meetings with Prime Minister Blair. I hope he succeeds in convincing Mr. Blair that elections should be held promptly in the North and that he will endeavour to pursue the Pat Finucane and Sellafield cases. The Prime Minister seems to have dug his heels in on Sellafield on many occasions and should recognise that the fight is with the EURATOM Treaty and the European Constitution.

Liam will be known to people in my constituency because he served his apprenticeship in terms of detail and accuracy in the service of the Anglo-Celt local newspaper, which covers all of Cavan and part of County Monaghan. He brought from that schooling all the gifts and fine honing of his trade that ensured the excellence of his work in this House. I want to pay tribute to him as a human being for his courtesy and easy manner at all times in my dealings with him. This is one of the abiding memories I will have of Liam and I wish to join with all Members here in wishing him many years of health and happiness in his retirement.I was disappointed that we did not get the opportunity to submit supplementary questions to the Taoiseach on the important matter of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	270	Supplementary questions were appropriate. The Deputy should read the questions submitted to the Taoiseach. I call Deputy Joe Higgins.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	274	On behalf of Deputy Gregory, the Independent Deputies and myself, I wish Liam Fitzgibbon well in his retirement. In the short six years I have been in the House, in contrast with his length of service, he was always extremely helpful to me and other Deputies. When we tried to get the "blacks" ahead of time if they were needed for a particular reason, he and his staff were most co-operative. I often had to go down to the very cramped headquarters where he and his staff work and about which something should be done. I pay tribute to Liam and his staff and wish him the very best in his retirement.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of topics under Standing Order 31. I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter of national importance, namely, the failure to plan for and recruit sufficient specialist nurses to complete and sustain extremely expensively assembled multi-disciplinary surgical teams in Crumlin and other acute hospitals; the impact of this failure on patient mortality and the Minister's short-term and long-term plans to prevent further tragedies.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely, the cutbacks and lack of adequate resources at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, which is leading to a reduction in the level of beds and other services. An insufficient number of intensive care nurses caused the cancellation of heart surgery for a two year old girl from County Limerick who died within 24 hours of the cancellation.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter of urgent local and national importance, namely, the fact that Monaghan General Hospital has now been one year off-call. Surgical ward 2 is under temporary closure in Cavan General Hospital; and the danger to other rural areas that the winding down of services in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group might be used as a template for the overall restructuring of the health services, which would be a disaster for rural Ireland.

The Government is culpable in this death because it has ignored for years the growing crisis at the hospital which was highlighted in the Pollack report six months ago.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the dramatic downturn in the tourism industry in many parts of the country, resulting in staff lay-offs and imminent closures of many tourism enterprises and the need for Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Sorry, Deputy, only the notice submitted to my office is appropriate under Standing Order 31.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	282	—to intensify their marketing efforts both in the domestic market and the traditional tourism market.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	283	Having considered the matters raised, I do not consider them to be in order under Standing Order 31.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	284	The Order of Business today shall be No. 13, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the draft Civil Service code of standards and behaviour – back from committee; No. 14, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the Employment Equality Act 1998 (section 12) (Church of Ireland College of Education) Order 2003 – back from committee; No. 20, Immigration Bill 2002 [Seanad] – Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage; No. 2, Arts Bill 2002 – amendments from the Seanad; No. 22, Protection of employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003 [Seanad] – Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 23, Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 [Seanad] – Order for Report, Report and Final Stages.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m.; Nos. 13 and 14 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on the resumed Report and Final Stages of No. 20 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the proceedings on No. 2 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 30 minutes and any amendments from the Seanad not disposed of shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments to the Seanad amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism; Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 22 shall be taken today, and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 6.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 23 shall be taken today and shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Notwithstanding anything in public and private Standing Orders regarding the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charter Amendment) Bill 2002 – (a) Report Stage shall be taken tomorrow on the conclusion of the Order of Business, (b) Fifth Stage shall also be taken tomorrow, (c) opposed amendments shall be decided forthwith; and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 30 minutes; Private Members' Business shall be No. 36, motion re housing (resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	285	There are seven proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with the late sitting agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 13 and 14 without debate agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I do not object to this. I raised this matter previously and I would like to have a short synopsis of the committee's findings in order to pass these motions without debate.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	287	As a member of the committee, I want to ask whether the Government has read the committee's concerns about civil servants, particularly senior civil servants who may, on retiring, pass from the public to the private sector and who may deal with the privatisation of State assets. We sought an increase in the sanitation period from one year to two years.It is a very important point in relation to ethics in public life. Has the Government had a chance to consider that point and the other comments among the detailed observations of the committee?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I take issue with this item. The misunderstanding created by joining these issues is that there is some link between the Civil Service code of standards and behaviour and the Church of Ireland College of Education. It is patently obvious that a mockery is being made of these motions by taking them together.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The motion relates to taking them without debate.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	290	Without debate it may be, but let them be taken in their individual way—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	291	They will be taken in their individual way—
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	292	We are being asked to agree on Nos. 13 and 14 or not at all. That makes a mockery of each motion. These simple matters can be dealt with individually, without fuss and more effectively.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	293	As I pointed out to the Deputy, they will be taken separately when they come before the House.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I object again to the procedure in this instance. Perhaps the Chair will use his good offices to reflect on the unsuitability of this practice. These items should be presented individually to be moved without debate rather than lumping them together. That is the critical point. I appeal to the Minister and the Chief Whip, as I did last week, to order business differently from the beginning of the new term.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	295	We are talking about a procedural matter here. First and foremost, these matters were debated in committee, where all groupings in the House had the chance to say whatever they deemed necessary. I will have Deputy Burton's point considered, as I understand some work will go on through the summer on that code of practice.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The committee report—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	297	There is no provision for a second contribution.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	298	On a point of order, we have raised this issue repeatedly—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	299	That is not a point of order. I will allow the Deputy to raise this point later, but not now.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I need to raise it now.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The Deputy cannot raise it now as his party has already made a contribution on the issue.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	302	On a point of order—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I will take the Deputy's point at the end of the proposals. It is not really a point of order but as it is near the summer recess we will take it. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 20 agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I oppose this proposal on the basis of the concept of a guillotine being used.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	305	This involves a guillotine but the Bill is also unrecognisable from the Bill that we started with. There were 34 pages of amendments introduced on Committee Stage and ten further pages on Report Stage, but there was no opportunity for debate or to hear expert evidence. The Human Rights Commission, in the person of Dr. Maurice Manning, complained to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for denying it the chance to examine the new amendments, yet the Minister presses ahead. This is not the only time that has happened in this term.Apart entirely from the guillotine, this is not the way to enact complex legislation – giving Opposition Members weighty amendments as they start Committee or Report Stage and expecting them to scrutinise legislation in the public interest. It is unacceptable and I oppose it.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	306	This is the hundredth sitting day of the Dáil and on that basis I calculate we are working a one and a half day week, which is good work if one can get it. To increase productivity the Government is now rushing legislation through, obviously to give the impression it has done a lot, and perhaps has a lot more to do.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	307	More holidays to take.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	308	The way this is being done is completely unacceptable. Amending legislation beyond recognition and then applying a guillotine is making a mockery of the House. It is unacceptable and that is why we oppose it.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I will hear a brief contribution from Deputy O Caoláin. Yesterday he made a very long contribution on this issue by choice and I asked him to wait until today.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I acknowledge the Chair's memory.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	311	A very brief contribution.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	312	Again, I oppose this for the many reasons already articulated. Only five amendments out of 150 have been dealt with and it is outrageous that this matter will not be dealt with substantively. I strongly object.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	313	In an ideal world it would be better not to have such a number of amendments coming at a late stage—
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	314	It is on the books since last year.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	315	—but we should bear in mind the importance of the legislation and the necessity of passing it. I have a note from the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, that we spent 23 hours and 40 minutes on the Bill on Second and Committee Stages. I defy contradiction in stating that we have not spent as much time on any other legislation.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The question is that the proposal for dealing with No. 22 be agreed to.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	317	Again, this is the use of the guillotine. We will have, at most, two and a half hours or thereabouts to deal with the Committee and Remaining Stages of a Bill transposing an important EU directive into law. There have been substantial submissions from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and from IBEC on these matters. The Government has had years to implement the directive, and it is already well beyond the legal date for implementation. It is grossly unfair that new amendments have been circulated in recent days and that we do not have a proper chance to debate the issues in the short time provided.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I am aware that the European Court of Justice has threatened to prosecute the State for failing to introduce this Bill. On Second Stage, the Minister said he would put forward a major amendment at the heart of the Bill, thus making it almost impossible as an Opposition Deputy to even consider an amendment, knowing that the guts of the Bill would only appear on the day or the day before it got to Committee and Remaining Stages. It is impossible to do business when one cannot amend a Bill because one does not know what the Bill will be until Report Stage.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The only reason amendments are put forward, either by the Opposition or the Government, is to try to improve the legislation.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The question is that the proposal for dealing with No. 23 be agreed to."
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I am opposed to this Bill being guillotined. There is now a great deal of confusion about this Bill. Every single Member of the House has received correspondence and visits from various sectors interested in the area of liquor licensing, including the Equality Authority, night club owners, hotel owners and licensees. It is not right that this should be guillotined, and I am opposed to it on that basis.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I oppose the taking of this Bill also, which was only introduced in the House two weeks ago and which, I am told up and down the country, is unworkable. Every time one meets people on the street, not just publicans, one is told the Bill is unworkable. If kids are under 14 they can be brought into the pub but if they are over 14 they cannot. It depends which part of the pub one is in or whether one is having a sandwich or a pint. Publicans are made responsible for policing. It switches the processing of discrimination cases from the equality forum to the courts, a move condemned by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Human Rights Commission and the ICCL.The Bill has been rushed through the House, from start to end, in two weeks. This is not the way to make legislation. I suspect that most colleagues in the House agree with the contention that the Bill is unworkable. It contains very similar measures to those that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform famously denounced here one night. I remember him saying at some considerable length how—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	323	The Deputy would not want to get into detail on the Bill and should just deal with the reason he is opposing the proposal.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I think he said that we could not have a Horlicks and Ryvita society and this would not be workable, yet now he is pressing ahead with it. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, is as bemused as I am. I am opposing this.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I echo the points made by Deputy Rabbitte. This Bill is being guillotined, but the Bill itself is anti-family, anti-tourism and anti-fun. It does little or nothing to address the problem of alcohol abuse. I object to the guillotine and object to the Bill.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	326	This Bill—

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Where does the Government keep its backbench cranks waiting in the wings? Are they all corralled in the Dáil Bar waiting to be brought in to vote? This Bill will not address the fundamental issues that need to be addressed in relation to the abuses highlighted by Deputies on both the Government and Opposition benches. We have to recognise that it will not work.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I have very good reason to remember that it is very difficult to get unanimity when it comes to matters relating to intoxicating drink and habits, cultures, traditions and all the rest of it—

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I was just lucky perhaps to survive it all. Having said that, everybody in the House agrees that it is necessary to take some steps to address this problem. In the next 12 months, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will introduce a consolidating Bill which will cover a range of issues, and Deputies will all have the opportunity to give their views again.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	335	So it is a temporary little arrangement.

The definition of a private Bill is clearly laid down. It states that every Bill promoted for the particular interest or benefit of any person or locality, as distinguished from a measure of public policy, shall be treated as a private Bill. I contend that the RCSI's role is one of public policy. It covers the areas of education and health and has implications for the delivery of health care throughout the length and breadth of this jurisdiction, which affects each and every citizen at some time, and sadly all too many at this juncture.The process in relation to the Private Members' approach to dealing with legislation, particularly in this instance where we are considering an institution which has major corporate interests and is enjoying tax free status having been registered as a charity, is absolutely unsuitable and unsatisfactory.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	338	We cannot discuss what one might like to say on the Bill.

One of the greatest anomalies of all – this is a new process in terms of my experience in this House – is that the amendments are not being appraised and adjudged by the Government but by the promoters of the Bill, an outside body, and they will determine the acceptability or otherwise of the amendments presented by a Member of this House. In what other legislative procedure would any Member in this House accept that process? It is outrageous. Legislation is the preserve of Government, and the role of the Opposition, as the Minister said earlier, is to improve, tighten or oppose it, or whatever the case might be. In this instance an outside agency, the sponsors of the Bill, has the final adjudication over the acceptability or otherwise of the amendments I tabled. I will not have an opportunity in 30 minutes to address them adequately or substantively, nor will I have the chance to engage with the sponsors in this forum. I ask that Members at least accord me the courtesy of listening to what I have to say, as this is an extremely important issue.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Deputy Ó Caoláin is right in one aspect. There is a very exact procedure about these Bills. The only point on which he is wrong is that these procedures are being followed to the letter of the law. As far as outside influence or help, in this or other legislation, is concerned, this House benefits enormously from groups and individuals who have an interest in legislation and who have assisted Deputies on all sides of the House down through the years.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	347	We must get some ciúnas for you first. Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	348	The Freedom of Information Act was introduced in this House in 1997 with a view to giving citizens access to personal and other information. The Government has rammed through changes to that Act. In view of the comments made yesterday by the Information Commissioner and the Ombudsman, the unjust charges now imposed—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	349	Sorry, Deputy, that does not arise on the Order of Business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I am coming to the point if you will allow me, a Cheann Comhairle. In view of the charges imposed in law by the Government, is it the intention of Government that these charges, which I do not accept, take effect immediately or do they have to wait until the Dáil sits for 21 days, to be given effect by the statutory instrument? No. 60a on today's Order Paper in my name and that of the Fine Gael Party, is a motion to annul with immediate effect Statutory Instrument No. 264 of 2003, Freedom of Information Act 1997 (Fees) Regulations 2003. In view of the comments made yesterday by the Information Commissioner that these charges pose an economic sanction upon citizens and are a discouragement, will Government time be made available to debate the motion?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	351	My understanding is that these charges will become effective very soon. There is no opportunity to debate the motion.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	356	—that the Government is imposing unjust charges on citizens that will act as a deterrent to their seeking information in the first instance. How do I move motion No. 60a?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I suggest you do so under Private Members' Business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	358	Does that mean the Government is refusing to give Government time to discuss this matter?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	359	In respect of the tragedy that occurred yesterday at Crumlin children's hospital, I presume the results of the investigation will be available within a day or two?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	360	That question might be more appropriate to an Adjournment debate or to questions. It is not appropriate to the Order of Business.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I was asking a different question, a Cheann Comhairle. In light of that tragedy, the imminent publication of the Hanly report, the crisis in the disability sector and the promise to the House that even though the disability Bill which my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, has been pursuing in the House, will not be published, there was a definite commitment from the Taoiseach that the education for people with disabilities Bill would be published before the summer recess. Will the Minister for Defence agree to reconvene the House for a day or two in early July to discuss the crisis in the health services and the implications of these serious matters – disability, the Hanly report, the tragedy that has happened because of a shortage of trained intensive care nurses at Crumlin hospital and so on? This has caused greater alarm outside this House than any issue that has arisen in recent times.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The education for people with disabilities Bill has been cleared by the Government and it will be published very soon. Our genuine intention was to publish it before the summer recess. We are almost meeting the target but regretfully not doing so. The Bill will be published within a very short time.There was a debate in the House on health last Friday. We deeply regret the tragedy in Crumlin and extend our sympathies to the family concerned. I am not able to give the House a specific time for the conclusion of that investigation, but it will be concluded as quickly as possible.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I ask for a definite response regarding promised legislation on tribunals. The Taoiseach indicated this morning that such legislation is forthcoming. Will the Minister be more specific and tell the House the type of legislation the Government has in mind?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	364	The type of legislation would not be appropriate for discussion now. What would be appropriate would be whatever legislation is coming before the House and the Minister might have the date the legislation is promised.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	365	The Government has just cleared the Commission of Inquiry, which will be an entirely new system for dealing with problems of that nature. As far as other matters related to the tribunal are concerned, these will have to wait for final adjudication by the Attorney General before anyone in this House can make a positive decision as to the exact nature of the legislation.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I am glad the Minister for Defence is representing the Government here today. In view of the perceived threat to Sellafield by planes under the control of terrorists, is the Minister proposing to introduce legislation or regulations to control the over-flying of planes at sporting events here, given that a plane that cannot be identified entered Irish air space and flew over a major sporting event last Sunday night? We do not know where it came from or who controlled it.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	368	It could be quite appropriate to the Order of Business. Has the Minister of Defence any knowledge of where the plane came from?

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	372	The only thing I can say is—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I would prefer if the Minister would not answer questions which are out of order.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I wonder if the Minister for Defence is aware that the Tánaiste gave an undertaking in this House that there would be a debate on the three reports on the health service – not just on two reports. Would he respond to the request that the Dáil be reconvened to deal this important issue? On promised legislation, in view of the terrible tragedy that has now occurred, will the Government at the very least bring forward the Nurses Bill? We have a real problem in intensive care nursing and the Government has failed totally to deal with it. Can we bring forward the Nurses Bill to ensure the matter is dealt with?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	375	The heads of the Bill are expected very soon, but it is not intended that legislation will be dealt with until next year. With regard to the various reports on the health services, the Deputy is aware that the Hanly Report was not available, while the other two reports were dealt with. It is an ongoing matter with very substantial changes proposed. There will be an opportunity over the coming months for discussions as to the best way forward.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	376	Deputy Rabbitte asked a very pertinent question in respect of the Hanly Report. We know it was not published when the debate took place last week.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I will say it in a different way. When the report is available, in view of the fact that it is central to the change in the health system that the Government wants to bring about – I am sure the Government has the same target as everyone else, of having a health system that works, based on need – will the Minister respond to the request by Deputy Rabbitte that the Dáil might come back for a day to discuss it?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	379	That has been brought up twice already.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	380	In the six years that the Government has been in office, the price of a modest home in Dublin has quadrupled. This year the price is scheduled to rise by a further €26,000.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Has the Deputy a question appropriate to the Order of Business? He should come to the question because it is almost 1 p.m.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	382	That means a modest home will cost €232,000 at the end of this year. I have looked in vain in the legislative programme for an answer, but could the Minister at least let me know when legislation, which it has been hinted will control speculation on building land, will be brought before the Dáil, in order to give some measure of relief to young people attempting to purchase a home in the future?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	383	There is no specific legislation promised, but I understand the committee on the Constitution will hold public hearings later on this month.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18371	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	384	Later today we will see the publication of the Government's accounts, showing its expenditure and tax revenue in the year to date. This will reveal that the Government is spending significantly beyond its budgets in certain areas. I would like to know from the Minister if we will see Supplementary Estimates notified to the Dáil before we go into recess? Clearly there are issues occurring in the spending estimates, and on the tax side, on which the Dáil needs information before the prolonged recess. Will there be a proper statement to the Dáil on these issues?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	385	There will be no Supplementary Estimates this year. It is not unusual in the first six months of the year. If the Deputy recalls, this time last year there was wide speculation that we would be way off the mark by the end of year, yet when the year ended we were dead on target.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18371	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	386	Can we take that as an authoritative statement, or just a bit of whistling by the graveyard?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I would be glad if the Deputy kept to the matter under discussion.

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Will the Disability Bill be introduced at the same time? As I understand it, there were two Bills mentioned by the Taoiseach. We would like to know the up to date position regarding the Bills. I have another question related to something which is becoming an issue at local level. The enforcement of fines Bill, which will mean that people will go to jail for not paying small fines—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The Deputy may not comment on it now. It is 1 o'clock in the afternoon.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	393	Regarding the enforcement of fines Bill, work is at a very preliminary stage. It is not possible to say when that legislation might be introduced. With regard to the Disability Bill, it has been explained to the House on a few occasions that once the Education for People with Disabilities Bill is published and enacted, as soon as possible thereafter the Disability Bill will be introduced.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	394	Can you give a time?

In page 4, line 22, to delete "persons" and substitute "non-nationals".I welcome the Minister of State. I notice that his lordship has not arrived himself. I have just noticed that the legislation was originally printed on yellow paper indicating it was a Seanad Bill. It is now printed on green paper. What is the status of the legislation? Has it now been metamorphosed into a Dáil Bill?Section 2, which provides for carrier liability, makes no distinction between non-nationals and citizens. I am proposing that such a distinction should be made. It is invidious and improper for Irish citizens to be rounded up, so to speak, by a carrier in any vehicle and to be presented to an immigration officer by a carrier. Irish citizens do not have to obtain permission from anybody to enter Ireland. The onus is now on the carrier to ensure that each Irish citizen's passport and visa are valid and that everything is in order in that respect. It is improper for them to present the citizen to an immigration officer. The distinction should be made.In this legislation, we are passing on the responsibility of immigration officers regarding access to this country to an employee of an individual carrier who is totally untrained and has no experience in what is required. How will such a person know if a passport is valid or invalid and whether documentation is in order? This seems to be the wrong approach.The distinction I seek is necessary and should be made in law in any case. On the other side of the coin, no distinction is made as to whether the non-nationals being dealt with will be seeking asylum. The Minister has refused to accept any amendment that would allow the distinction to be made other than for asylum seekers on board a vehicle seeking to land. The effect of the section will be to remove the possibility of any genuine asylum seeker ever having the opportunity to land in Ireland.Yesterday the Irish Human Rights Commission notified Opposition Members of its grave concerns about this legislation. From newspaper reports, I note that it also communicated with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform even though he gave us no indication of that when speaking in the House last night. The commission is particularly concerned with the carrier liability aspect of the legislation. A document it circulated to us states that the carrier sanctions "may thwart legitimate claims to asylum by impeding access to the territory of the State on the basis that a person does not have adequate travel documentation". It goes on to indicate that article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 31 of the convention relating to the status of refugees and article 33 of the convention on non-refoulement may all be breached by these proposals.The commission outlines a very specific example of a Council of Europe resolution on asylum to persons in danger of persecution where the committee of members, to which Ireland was doubtless a party, stated:Governments should ensure that no one shall be subjected to refusal of admission at the frontier, rejection, expulsion or any other measure which would have the result of compelling him to return to or remain in a territory where he would be in danger of persecution for reasons of race religion nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.These are clearly the issues the commission would have put to the Minister if it had been granted the opportunity to do so. I am in accordance with those views, which have been put not only by the Irish Human Rights Commission but also by various other organisations with an interest in human rights, including Amnesty International. The Irish Human Rights Commission quotes the UNHCR regarding its concern about the manner in which carrier liability is being introduced into this jurisdiction.The carrier liability provision is confusing in the manner in which it is presented because no distinction is made between non-nationals, those seeking asylum and Irish citizens. The broader thrust of the section is to try to impede anybody having the right to apply for asylum in this country and to impose the onus on the carrier and take it away from the immigration officer, thereby creating a whole new responsibility under penalty of very severe fines on carriers whose employees are inexperienced and untrained to do the job they are now being asked to do by the State.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I would like to answer some specific points raised by Deputy Costello. This is still a Seanad Bill, which will have to go back to that House to seek approval for the amendments agreed in the Dáil. I am informed that the Minister only received the letter from the Irish Human Rights Commission late this morning after it had already been reported in the newspapers.Section 2(1) applies to persons who arrive in a vehicle from a place outside the State other than the common travel area. The requirement in sections 2(1)(a) and 2(1)(b) is for the carrier to ensure that everyone on his or her vehicle disembarks in compliance with any directions given by an immigration officer and that everyone on the vehicle is presented to the immigration officer.The requirement in section 2(3)(a) is that everyone in the vehicle be listed when this is sought. These requirements cannot be confined to non-nationals in reality. Do the proposers of these amendments expect a carrier to separate Irish passengers from others in the context of complying with a simple direction to disembark or any of the other requirements, which are all pretty simple? Undoubtedly that would lead to interminable delays and confusions at ports and airports and to far greater inconvenience for carriers and passengers than compliance with the straightforward and simple requirements of the Bill as it stands.The Government proposals have been loudly criticised by many non-governmental organisations. One of the principal criticisms is that carrier liability proposals will turn carrier staff into immigration officers. The proposals in the Bill will do nothing of the sort but these amendments certainly would. Carrier staff would be obliged by these amendments to sort out Irish passengers from others to ensure they are dealt with under the separate immigration processes for both classes envisaged in the amendments. In other words, carriers will be obliged to do a pre-landing check on the immigration status of their passengers. The impracticability of doing this is obvious.This type of provision, furthermore, provides a red carpet for those who wish to abuse immigration controls. If a person in charge of a vehicle does not wish to co-operate with the immigration authorities, refuses to comply with any of the requirements and simply asserts that all the people on board are Irish, what is the immigration officer to do? How can the truth of the assertion be verified? It simply could not be done because these amendments would exclude power to carry out verifying checks.We considered the points raised by Deputies Costello and Ó Snodaigh on Committee Stage concerning the example of the Irish person returning by yacht from Calais. We appreciate the point raised. However, on reflection, I do not see how the requirements that all passengers be present can be overcome without leaving a gaping hole in the carrier liability arrangements. Immigration officers are available in every superintendent's district and are accessible at approved ports and airports.These amendments are impractical, and any awareness of the reality of passenger management at our airports will bear this out. Carriers, as a matter of routine, co-operate with the immigration authorities because it is not only good practice, but also good business to do so. Again, I ask the Opposition Deputies to withdraw these amendments on the basis that they simply will not work.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	420	What the Minister of State is proposing will be difficult to work when the burden of responsibility is placed on the carrier to make it work. All people entering this country will, first and foremost, be vetted by carriers. What authority does a carrier have to vet an Irish citizen? There is a major constitutional question about this. The carriers will vet passports and visas and give people directions to disembark. While the Minister of State has no problem with the carrier giving directions to land, he has problems with the carrier doing a pre-landing check on passports to see whether they are Irish or non-national. That has to be done anyway.The legislation specifically states that the carrier has to ensure there is a valid passport or other equivalent documents. Once that is checked, it will be known whether the person is an Irish citizen. It is sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander. He cannot have both ways. The Minister of State strayed into the murky area of the fog across the channel when the Progressive Democrats yachtsman from Dún Laoghaire went across to Cherbourg on a day trip.

The legislation is specific on this issue. It states, "All persons on board the vehicle seeking to land in the State are presented to an immigration officer for examination in respect of leave to land."  While the Minister of State says that he considered that section since we raised it on Committee Stage, he has not said how he is going to get around this difficulty. What happens if the carrier does not find an immigration officer in Dún Laoghaire when they arrive back from a day trip?Arising out of this legislation, there will be a specific statutory onus on the carrier that was not there before. If there are people in the crew or on board who are travelling in such a case, they will have to be presented by the carrier to the immigration officer before they land. Their passports and travel documents must be checked. The Minister of State is making no distinction between Irish nationals and non-nationals, which is what I am doing. By refusing to make a distinction, the carrier now has a statutory responsibility. An offence will be created under this legislation if this rule is not adhered to and a penalty will be imposed. That issue needs to be addressed.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I disagree with Deputy Costello's contention that we are turning carriers into immigration officers. What we are doing is improving the controls on preventing illegal immigration. It is a problem that has been with us for some time, costing much money and causing public anxiety. There is support for the proposals we are putting forward. It is impossible to absolutely control this area. We are involving carriers in the process but they are not being turned into immigrations officers.As I understand the legislation, carriers are being asked to carry out a rudimentary check. They will be informed what to look for in respect of false documents. They simply have to check people's documents to see if they are in order or seem to be in order. When they reach the frontiers of the State, if they are requested by an immigration officer to ask people to present themselves, they simply do that.I have listened carefully to what Deputy Costello says, as I always do, and I cannot see any basis for distinguishing between nationals and non-nationals. All the carrier has to do, if requested by the immigration officer, is direct people to disembark for the officers to check documents. It makes no sense to have a situation where carriers ask non-Irish people to disembark while every person they are satisfied with as being Irish can stay on. I also do not believe there is any great issue of human rights involved in this case.I accept the point about the carrier doing an initial check on the documentation, but it is not a detailed check. It is a rudimentary check to see if the documents are in order. If a person brings somebody into the State whose documents are manifestly not in order, they are liable to certain penalties. The average, reasonable person on the street will say that is a sound proposal based on logic and common sense.Returning to the example of shopping trips and yachts etc., it is the immigration officer who will ask for people to disembark if he feels it necessary to do so. That is a matter within his or her discretion.

There may be contraband people as well as contraband tobacco and alcohol. The fact that somebody happens to come into a quiet, peaceful place in west Cork back from a genteel shopping trip should not mean that he or she is not to be subject to the same controls as anybody else. That is the view of most reasonable people. I understand the point of view put forward by human rights organisations. I also understand why certain people have to be seen to take certain stances, but in so far as people in the legal profession are concerned, those who know something about this area with whom I have discussed the legislation, they think the requirements on carriers are perfectly reasonable. They do not think they are unduly onerous. They think the legislation will be effective in controlling the flow of illegal immigration, which is its principal objective.

A specific onus is put on the carrier to present everyone on board to the immigration officer. That is a new statutory duty which did not previously exist and its implementation, whether it is in west Cork or Dún Laoghaire, will create a major problem.The section clearly specifies that the carrier must check the authenticity of the documentation. Repeated reference is made to the validity of the documents. It is not merely specifying a cursory perusal of the documentation, it is demanding the authenticity.

In page 4, to delete lines 29 to 34.The Minister is trying to assert the principle of carrier liability. This will force untrained airline staff, ferry staff, and now train staff, into the role of immigration officers. The protection of human rights will be devolved to commercial entities thereby giving rise to a risk of indiscriminate prevention of individuals from entering Irish territory to claim asylum.The Minister of State managed to insult many people by saying that there are those who have to be seen to be taking a position. The concerns expressed by me and other Deputies are deeply held. The same is true for those in the UNHCR, Amnesty International, the Human Rights Commission and the Irish Refugee Council. They have put a great deal of effort into examining this matter and trying to explain their position, in spite of the Minister's attempt to railroad this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas. Those concerns are valid and the Minister of State should take on board the need to strike out this section on carrier liability.Any measure which directly or indirectly obstructs asylum seekers from entering this territory, is incompatible with international law, in particular with Article 31.1 of the 1951 UN refugee convention. The effect of carrier liability as presented in this legislation would fall into that category.A state's right to control its borders is not absolute. It has to be proportionate and humane and the denial of entry into the State on the basis of a lack of proper documentation will remove access to the asylum apparatus established under the Refugee Act 1996. The proposed legislation is without any mechanism for transparency, accountability or means of appeal. My party and other Deputies are in agreement with the human rights organisations that this section should be removed and that my amendments to this section, particularly amendment No. 9, should be accepted.It is well known that people fleeing from persecution are forced to travel with incorrect and incomplete documentation. Denied regular means of transport as a consequence of this legislation, refugees will be driven, as I said on Committee Stage, to resort to dangerous means of travel. This section will force many asylum seekers into the hands of smugglers and into the back of freight containers. We saw the tragic results of this practice in Wexford and in other countries.As the Minister said on Committee Stage, other European countries have introduced carrier liability legislation. The results, however, have been horrific. Many refugees, forced into irregular transport means, have been drowned, frozen or suffocated en route. As of 20 November 2002, nearly 3,500 asylum seekers have died trying to access the fortress Europe which is being created by legislation such as this, and these are only the documented cases. This section will increase the potential for such gruesome and unnecessary episodes to continue.As drafted, this section on carrier liability does not allow for any asylum-related defences to liability. The UNHCR stated that such measures interfere with the ability of persons at risk of persecution to gain access to safety and that this is incompatible with international human rights and refugee protection principles, notably Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to which each person has a right to seek asylum, and Articles 31 and 33 of the 1951 refugee convention. The UNHCR strongly argued that carrier's liability should not apply to refugees and asylum seekers. I agree with this position, as do many other bodies. We are opposed to the section in its entirety. I urge the Minister of State to adopt amendment No. 9. even at this late stage. The Minister has indicated that he is not willing to accept even practical amendments from the Opposition.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	439	Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued through the United Nations, which has the primary role in the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN has no standing military forces of its own and relies on the voluntary provision of resources by willing members. At present, according to the Defence Acts, Defence Forces personnel can only serve overseas in an operation established by the UN Security Council or General Assembly. It does not allow for Irish contingents to participate in missions which are clearly endorsed by the Security Council but which have not been established by the UN.The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, which provides for the deployment of troops on overseas missions, was drafted at a time when it was not envisaged that the UN would engage regional organisations on its behalf, rather than directly raise forces of its own. However, there has been a significant rise in the number of peacekeeping and peace-enforcement operations carried out by regional organisations or ad hoc coalitions with the sanction or approval of the UN. This is due not only to the considerable increase in the number of peacekeeping operations but also to the specialised nature of particular operations. An example is the current French-led EU Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This operation was established by UN Resolution 1484 but is initially being implemented by the EU on behalf of the UN.The circumstances which arose in relation to the participation of the Defence Forces in the first EU peace support operation, currently under way in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, are unlikely to recur. Deputies will recall that while UN Security Council Resolution 1371 of September 2001 noted that the UN "strongly supports" the establishment of a multinational security presence in FYROM, Irish Defence Forces personnel were not able to participate. The Attorney General advised the Government that the UN endorsement did not satisfy the requirement, as laid out in the Defence Acts, that the UN must establish or authorise the establishment of the EU-led force.However, as I have stated in the past, in a volatile international security environment, I believe that we should keep the matter under review to ensure that we are not found wanting should circumstances arise where the Government would wish to consider Defence Forces participation in a crisis calling for a response from the international community, which conforms to Ireland's proud tradition in contributing to international peace and security.

I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify his comments of 18 May in Brussels. I am quite certain that from the viewpoint of his Department and the Defence Forces, and given the current evolving situation, what prevailed in the past may not necessarily be sufficient to meet future demands.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	441	As the Deputy knows, the triple lock requirement, as it is referred to – involving the approval of the Dáil if the number exceeds 12, UN establishment and Government approval – has provided fundamental safeguards regarding previous Irish participation in peacekeeping activities. Clearly, I have no intention of interfering with either Dáil or Government approval. The fact that the UN supports missions but does not necessarily establish or authorise its own force created a problem for us in Macedonia. We were anxious to be involved in that expedition but because of our Defence Acts we could not participate. In the changing international situation, I wanted to open a debate and reach cross-party consensus on this matter, if possible, by staying with the UN. The UN is changing the position and, considering the change I am advocating, I will be adhering to what the UN is now doing, as distinct from what it used to do. We should have a cross-party debate as to the best way forward. I have an open mind on the matter and I appreciate the supportive comments of Opposition Members in this regard.

However, I want to prepare the ground in an open and transparent way in the face of emerging changes and, as I indicated in my earlier reply, to stay with the United Nations as the responsible international organisation leading these matters. It is because of the changes that have been made in the UN that I have presented the position thus.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 63 and 65 together.The Government has decided to replace the Gulfstream IV and the Beechcraft King Air in the ministerial air transport role. The decision was necessary to meet the ever-increasing demands of Government business, not least in the context of a significantly enlarged European Union.The two tender competitions for the acquisition of the aircraft, a long-range aircraft and a smaller seven to nine-seater aircraft, are now in train. The closing date for receipt of tenders for both competitions was 30 May 2003.The tender competitions allowed for the submission of both new and previously owned aircraft and all options, such as outright purchase, lease, lease-purchase or other alternatives were open for consideration. In tandem with proposals for the supply of the aircraft, tenderers were also asked to outline offers for the Gulfstream IV aircraft as at the proposed date of hand-over of the tendered aircraft or in mid-July 2004, following the EU Presidency. Offers for the Beechcraft King Air were also requested in tandem with proposals for its replacement. Tenders were received from nine companies in respect of the long range aircraft and from six companies for the seven to nine seat aircraft. Some tenders contained a number of proposals. In addition, a number included new and pre-owned aircraft.The tenders are the subject of evaluation and, accordingly, the Deputies will appreciate I cannot comment on the process, which is ongoing. I expect the evaluation process to be completed in or around the end of this month. The acquisition of the aircraft will be the subject of a detailed cost benefit analysis, including value for money, with comparison costs associated with alternative arrangements. Responses to the tender process will determine the most advantageous system of payment.The cost of the acquisition of the aircraft can only be defined following the evaluation process, particularly given that pre-owned aircraft are a consideration. It is expected the new aircraft should be available for operational service by 1 October 2003.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	445	How many tenders were received by the closing date for the Government Gulfstream IV jet? Has a decision been made on whether new or second-hand aircraft will be purchased? Has a decision been made on whether they will be purchased or leased? Will the Minister give an indication of the high expenditure of public money involved?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	446	As I indicated in my reply, there were nine tenders for larger aircraft and six for the smaller aircraft. A number of tenders include both new and pre-owned aircraft. It will not be possible to indicate the expenditure involved until decisions are taken following the evaluation process, which is under way and should be completed by the end of the month. There will be a tough evaluation of the tenders, bearing in mind value for money and the method of payment, should that arise.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	447	Given that the stated purpose of the acquisition of lavish new aircraft is that Ireland will assume the EU Presidency next January, is the Minister satisfied the aircraft will be in place? Will Air Corps personnel require training to fly and maintain the aircraft? When will this take place? Will a Supplementary Estimate be introduced to provide for their acquisition?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	448	No Supplementary Estimate will be introduced by any Department and that has been made absolutely clear since the beginning of the year. It is expected, if a decision is taken following the evaluation to accept tenders, that a number of the aircraft will be available before the end of the year. With regard to the smaller aircraft, a short time, if any, would be required to train Air Corps personnel whereas if the larger aircraft were acquired, a longer training period would be necessary. I am assured by the Air Corps that is well within its ambit.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	449	If no Supplementary Estimate is provided, does that mean the finance is in place for acquisition or lease of the aircraft?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	450	No, there is no provision in my Estimate this year for this purpose. This could mean a number of things. Little money may be required this year or it could depend on whether the Government leases the aircraft or purchases them outright or on the time frame agreed to make payments for pre-owned aircraft. A small amount could be involved this year.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	451	Ireland assumes the EU Presidency on 1 January.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	452	These matters cannot be debated today because I want the evaluation to proceed as independently as possible without reference to the money available.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	453	It has been established that tenders were invited for short haul and long haul aircraft. Has the Minister undertaken a cost benefit analysis of leasing or purchasing the aircraft? Has such an analysis been applied to both new and pre-owned aircraft? How necessary will both aircraft be following our Presidency of the EU? Has that been taken into account in an economic analysis of the proposal?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	454	We currently have two aircraft, which have been utilised to the full over several years. These aircraft offered great flexibility to a number of Governments as people had an opportunity to conduct business in transit, prepare for meetings and return to Ireland much more quickly than they would have using commercial airlines. The aircraft have been instrumental in assisting Governments to do a much more efficient and effective job.Ireland is a €40 billion industry and Government representatives engage in significant travel through the 15 EU member states. Travel will increase considerably in May next year when the number of member states increases to 25.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Ireland is a society, not an industry.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	456	As Ireland is primarily an exporter, considerable business is also conducted outside Europe.Very often politicians and the public suggest that certain moneys could be put to better use. For example, this was said when we invested in Croke Park, yet when people attended the opening ceremony for the Special Olympics, they said it was great vision on the part of the Government to get involved with the GAA in this regard.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	457	That is why aircraft were flying overhead.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I attended the National Aquatic Centre and was reminded of the row in the House during which Members criticised the investment of money in the centre but when I saw the Special Olympians swimming, I said it was great that the Taoiseach had the vision to do that.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	459	Interestingly, the Minister did not reply to my question about the cost benefit analysis and weighing up the benefits of purchasing or leasing. What was the result of the analysis? We are in the second half of the financial year and next year's Estimates are about to be prepared. Has the financial requirement for the purchase or lease of the aircraft been identified in the Estimates?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I made it clear in reply to Deputy Sherlock that it would not be judicious of me to outline the funding that will be available during the evaluation process. This process will be undertaken strictly on the basis of the best value for money and I intend to conduct the process in the interest of the taxpayer to the best of my ability.I am sorry I did not reply to the Deputy's earlier question. He knows the answer but he is notorious for asking questions to which he knows the answers. It is not unusual for any of us to do so when in Opposition. The Deputy can take it that no cost benefit analysis of leasing versus purchase is needed. If one has the money, nine times out of ten or 99 times out of 100, paying for something when purchased tends to be the best way to do business. There are always costs associated with putting off payment. Having said that, current interest rates are at an historically low level, therefore, purchase by leasing and on the longer term is a more attractive proposition than it used to be.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	461	Is the Minister aware that a number of companies which tendered have done an evaluation of the benefits both to them and to the purchaser of lease versus purchase? Will he clarify if his Department will be doing an independent analysis? Will his Department recognise and take account of the analysis and information made available by those who are in the industry and who are conversant with leasing and purchase to large corporations?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	462	We will make an independent decision based on the best advice available. Needless to say, we take account of advice from different areas. In the final analysis, however, it will be an independent decision which will not be based on outside influence.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	463	Provisions relating to the future possibility of a common EU defence policy have been contained in the existing treaties which were approved by the Irish people in the referenda held to ratify the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties.From Ireland's perspective as a neutral State, the draft treaty preserves the necessary safeguards as regards our position by ensuring that any future move to a common defence can only be made on the basis of unanimity within the European Council and in accordance with the respective constitutional requirements of the member states. Deputies will be aware that Ireland cannot enter into common defence arrangements without the support of the people by way of a constitutional amendment.The draft treaty outlines a basis for closer co-operation between member states on mutual defence. Along with the proposals for an EU common defence, the framing of such a proposal will be the subject of future negotiation during the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. In this regard, the proposal has been the subject of reservations both from neutral and non-aligned countries such as Ireland, and also from countries which see security and defence requirements being provided by way of their membership of NATO.As regards Ireland's defence policy, the White Paper on Defence provides that participation by the Defence Forces in peace support activities in the European domain will take place in the context of the Petersberg Tasks and when authorised by the UN. Our policy recognises the primacy of the UN in the area of international security. The proposals contained in the draft treaty should have no implications for Ireland's participation in UN authorised peace support operations.While the Government remains committed to Ireland's neutrality, I believe it is important that we engage in a meaningful debate on all areas of our involvement in the EU. We have seen in the recent past how the creation of mechanisms in Ireland, such as the Forum on Europe, have encouraged this debate and improved the understanding of the general public in the area of EU affairs. Clearly it is also important that the debate continues in this House under the mechanisms introduced by the Government to improve Oireachtas scrutiny of EU affairs.In this regard, I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the recent Fine Gael publication of its discussion document Beyond Neutrality which discusses some of the issues raised here. While much of the document already features as Government policy, the contribution of the Opposition parties to the debate in this important area is welcome.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I am sure the Minister will not agree with me but I will ask anyway. Does he agree that the draft provisions of the EU constitutional treaty will further militarise the EU, thus having significant implications for the direction of Europe, specifically for the direction of the defence policy of this State and our Defence Forces and, therefore, the House should debate fully the provisions prior to the beginning of Intergovernmental Conference negotiations? Will he give a commitment that the Government will do so and will consider reconvening the Dáil, if necessary, specifically for this purpose so that we can debate the issue prior to the Intergovernmental Conference?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I have no problem debating issues in the House once agreement is reached between the Whips. I disagree with the Deputy on the further militarisation of Europe which is constantly trotted out in this debate. The Deputy will be aware that the main concerns in Europe – this applies to the vast majority of our partners – is to be able to work together in a better way, particularly in the context of the Petersberg Tasks regarding our peacekeeping operations, crisis management and dealing with conflict. The Union has continued to move forward in this area by preparing better under the Partnership for Peace and having a greater understanding of co-operation. When one is faced with crisis management, dealing with conflicts and peace operations, it is necessary that all the instruments available to the Union embrace the challenges it faces in a much different and better way than was the case in the past. This calls for a much higher degree of co-operation and sophistication, not just in the military aspects but in the civilian aspects, which we have been driving forward in our contributions in the EU. We should never underestimate the demands that are out there regardless of whether one is talking about our involvement in Sarajevo, Kosovo or the Congo. We are continually faced with problems and the whole essence of what we are doing is to try to prepare better and be able to act more quickly.I have said many times that I regret that UN intervention, notwithstanding its great character in many ways, takes place after the holocaust is over, after the genocide and after so much tragedy and trauma have taken place. We need to be able to work together to act more quickly and more effectively.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	466	Despite all the waffle from the Minister, I said at the beginning that he would not agree with me. Obviously he is not aware of what is contained in the EU constitutional treaty. Will he assure us that the Irish Government's negotiators at the Intergovernmental Conference will protect Ireland's independent defence policy, specifically the traditional policies of military neutrality, by securing a specific article expressly recognising these rights and the duties of neutral states within the EU constitutional treaty when it is passed by the Intergovernmental Conference?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I suppose we all like to debate with Members in this House without casting aspersions on what they know and what they do not know. As far as I am concerned, we will ensure that the best interests of the Irish people are protected in everything we do. I supported the Amsterdam, Nice and Maastricht treaties. I supported the Irish people in their majority decisions in all of these cases.As far as the provision of safeguards is concerned, the Deputy can be assured that our national interests will be fully protected.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	468	Reports of courts of inquiry are confidential and are not generally intended for publication. However, following the tragic events at Tramore in 1999, I undertook to provide the families of the crew with a copy of the findings of the court of inquiry. Accordingly, once the court of inquiry had completed its work, I sought legal advice from the Attorney General's office on the release of the report. While I am entitled to waive confidentiality and to release documents in whole or in part, such release is subject to certain conditions, in particular, the requirements of fair procedures regarding third parties, for instance non-military personnel who would not be subject to a court of inquiry.On foot of the advice received from the Office of the Attorney General, a small number of sections were deleted before the findings of the court of inquiry were released to the families.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	469	This very day marks the fourth anniversary of the 1999 crash in Tramore, which was probably the worst disaster in the entire history of the Air Corps. Our thoughts are with the brave men who lost their lives and their families. Does the Minister agree with some of the relatives of those who died who do not believe they have received full and adequate replies to many of the questions raised by this disaster? Why was it considered necessary to delete some sections of the report of the military court of inquiry, given that it was an internal document not intended for publication and was only given to a number of relatives? Does the Minister agree that deleting sections of the report will only add to the suspicions of relatives that information is being withheld?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	470	Under the Defence Forces regulations, the findings and recommendations of all courts of inquiry are confidential. I have the power to waive that confidentiality but I can only do so under fair procedures – that means consulting the Attorney General on which sections must be omitted for legal reasons.I share the Deputy's concerns for and sympathies with the families who lost loved ones in this tragic clash, but there should be no suspicion that anything was withheld other than that which was absolutely legally necessary. Those sections dealt with third parties who were not subject to the court of inquiry. If the Deputy meets the families, he should convey that as sincerely as he can.We are not obliged to disclose the contents of a report of a court of inquiry. I waived that confidentiality clause and then consulted the Attorney General on the sections to be withheld. They were withheld on a strictly legal basis because they related to third parties who were not subject to the court of inquiry and only on that basis.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	471	On the broader issue of the disaster, have all the recommendations of the inquiry held by the air accident investigation unit into the crash been implemented? Are any recommendations still to be implemented? Is the Minister aware that the general secretary of PDFORRA said today that many personnel working in the search and rescue area have lost confidence in the flight safety environment in which they are required to work? This is a serious issue and must be addressed by the relevant authorities. Will the Minister deal with this?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I understand that earlier today PDFORRA raised some concerns regarding flight safety in the Air Corps and made some allegations of a general nature. Before I came into the House I was assured by the military authorities that there is no foundation whatsoever to these allegations.To answer the Deputy's earlier question, the accident investigation unit of the Department of Transport made a number of recommendations following the tragic Tramore crash and all of these recommendations have been put in place. I then established a safety audit of all the procedures in Baldonnel. Arising from that audit, the professional nature of the work and the highly motivated people in the Air Corps, a number of strongly complimentary remarks were made about the people in Baldonnel. I reject any suggestion that those in Baldonnel have adhered to anything other than the strictest safety procedures down through the years. Their record proves that. I support anything the Air Corps can do to improve on those high standards and to improve safety generally, bearing in mind that there is nothing as important as the safety of those who fly the aircraft.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	473	That concludes Priority Questions. We now move on to ordinary questions.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 75 together.Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued through the United Nations, which has the primary role in the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN has no standing military forces of its own and relies on the voluntary provision of resources by willing members. At present, according to the Defence Acts, Defence Forces personnel can only serve overseas in an operation "established" by the UN Security Council or General Assembly. It does not allow for Irish contingents to participate in missions, which are clearly endorsed by the Security Council but have not been established by the UN.The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2 Act) 1960, which provides for the deployment of troops on overseas missions, was drafted at a time when it was not envisaged that the UN would engage regional organisations on its behalf rather than directly raise forces of its own. However, there has been a significant rise in the number of peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations carried out by regional organisations or ad hoc coalitions with the sanction or approval of the UN. This is due not only to the considerable increase in the number of peacekeeping operations but also to the specialised nature of particular operations. An example is the current French-led EU “Operation Artemis” in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This operation was established by UN Resolution 1484 but is initially being implemented by the EU on behalf of the UN.The circumstances which arose regarding the participation of the Defence Forces in the first EU peace support operation, currently under way in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, are unlikely to recur. Deputies will recall that while the UN Security Council Resolution 1371 of September 2001 noted that the UN "strongly supports" the establishment of a multinational security presence in FYROM, Irish Defence Forces personnel were not able to participate. The Attorney General advised the Government that the UN endorsement did not satisfy the requirement as laid out in the Defence Acts that the UN must "establish" or authorise the establishment of the EU-led force. However, as I have stated in the past, in a volatile international security environment we should keep the matter under review to ensure that we are not found wanting should circumstances arise where the Government would wish to consider participation of the Defence Forces in a crisis calling for a response from the international community which conforms to Ireland's proud tradition in contributing to international peace and security.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	475	The Minister sounds bored when he reads these replies but perhaps he can clarify one thing.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	476	For one day in the year—
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I am not going to give the Minister any breaks, I am sorry. Will he explain how, in reply to a priority question on 15 May 2003, he gave no indication that he intended to amend the Defence Acts, while on 20 May 2003 he gave a newspaper interview in which he said we should consider amending the Defence Acts? Does this not show a certain amount of contempt for the House? He says one thing in the House and quite another outside it.Does the Minister accept that the problem here is that with the new European constitution, as with previous treaties which had military aspects, there is no requirement for a UN mandate? In a sense we are out of sync with other countries which do not have a so-called neutral status. Does the Minister agree that the only neutrality we have left is dependent on this UN requirement? Will he state clearly if he is considering amending the Defence Acts? Does he accept that the section of the Defence Act, to which I refer, does not state that service outside the State by Defence Forces' contingents can only be with a UN force? It stipulates that service with a UN force can only be pursuant to a resolution of the Dáil and therein lies a loophole. The Minister and the Government said they were committed to the European Union Bill 2001 which sought to deal with that loophole. It would enshrine the idea of a UN mandate in the legislation, but the Minister is now indicating that he wants to get rid of the requirement for a UN mandate.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I remind the House that supplementary questions are limited to one minute, as are replies by the Minister.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	479	Is it the Minister's intention, as has been stated by Deputy Gormley, to seek to change the law so that peacekeeping operations do not specifically have to be authorised by the United Nations? Is he seeking to involve Irish forces in peace enforcement rather than peacekeeping?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I am happy to come into the House to answer questions. Deputy Gormley may dislike the way I do so, but I cannot change the way I am. The Deputy has found me incapable, in so many ways, of doing my job and I cannot convince him otherwise, so we will leave that aside.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	481	We trust the Minister.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I have opened the debate on this issue. I have no plans to change the Defence Acts until I have considered every aspect of this issue and have listened to other opinions and to my colleagues in this House. The Deputy has a point in regard to something being said a few days later being entirely different. We must have the capacity to change our minds and to do things a little differently from time to time depending on the question one is asked. I was asked a question which I answered as honestly as I could. It arose from the problems which developed in FYROM. The advice from the Attorney General was that under the strictures of the Defence Acts, we could not participate in the first EU-led mission, even though it was strongly supported by the UN. What I am doing is opening up that debate. There may be times in the future when we could be restricted if we do not do that. I am not doing any more than that at the moment.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Will Irish forces be involved in peacekeeping activities which are unauthorised by the UN?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	484	We have no legal powers here nor have I, as Minister for Defence, to recommend to the Government or this House to participate in any such mission other than one established by the UN and approved by the Government and, if there are more than 12 members it must have the approval of this House. That is the triple lock.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The Minister is confusing me and I am not easily confused. A few moments ago during priority questions, he seemed to indicate that he is generating a debate with which we, on this side of the House, agree. He indicated in Brussels on 19 May last that this country should consider reviewing the Defence Acts if it wishes to participate. I accept the bona fides of what he said. More recently, he seems to have resiled from that concept. Are we having this debate? Did the Minister make those remarks which he is quoted as having made in Brussels? Is he now saying, "Let the debate take place"?

Is he still of that view? If he is of that view, does he accept that if there is no requirement for a UN mandate, we are moving away from the UN—
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	490	No.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	492	The Deputy should not try to misinterpret what I said. Up to now, we have talked, and will continue to talk, about a UN mandate and a UN established force for peacekeeping purposes. That is provided for in the Defence Acts, as constituted. I have opened a debate arising from what happened in Macedonia. I have a positive approach to staff and, as I said earlier, I will listen to advice from this House and other sources in connection with this matter.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I have given my view. I am anxious for consensus on this issue, if we can reach one. However, the Deputy should not misinterpret this as moving away from the UN. The UN has made the changes which I want to embrace, namely, supporting and endorsing rather than mandating.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	498	I have given my view on a number of occasions. I am obliged to give consideration to all of the other views, both in Government and in this House.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	500	I will answer the question the way I want. I will not be dedicated to; I am going to listen. I am opening a debate and when we have concluded it and if we can reach a consensus, then we will move forward.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	501	The Minister should have been called the Minister for the fence, because he is sitting on it, particularly on this issue.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 72 and 106 together.The decision to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of the medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps in July 2002 was taken due to budgetary constraints which meant that the level of defence expenditure had to be reduced. Any decision to acquire medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps in the future can only be taken as the financial resources permit. The decision to cancel the tender competition was an extremely difficult one for me. I am also aware of the acute disappointment felt by the Air Corps personnel when the decision was announced.However, having consulted the military authorities on the matter at that time, the main priority outlined for the Air Corps was the purchase of fixed-wing trainer aircraft to ensure that cadets continued to be commissioned, trained as pilots and retained in the Air Corps. In that regard, I was delighted to sign a contract with Pilatus of Switzerland in January 2003 for the supply of eight turbo propeller training aircraft which will be delivered in 2004. The value of the contract, including VAT, is around €60 million. These aircraft are a tangible response to the needs of the Air Corps at this time.When the decision to cancel the tender competition was made, I asked my officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopter services in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue while taking account of the current financial position.An interdepartmental working group was established to examine and consider alternative solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships, with a view to providing medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The public private partnership unit in the Department of Finance was also involved in assisting the working group in identifying and assessing possible solutions. In parallel with this, a joint military-civil board was established to review the overall rotary wing requirements for the Air Corps, in particular, the possible procurement of modern light utility helicopters for the Air Corps to replace its current fleet of Allouettes and Gazelles.Obviously, the procurement of light utility helicopters raises similar issues regarding funding options. Having regard to the need to prioritise asset requirements in the context of available resources, the advice of the working group on funding has been incorporated into the report of the joint civil military board on rotary wing requirements, which deals with both search and rescue and light utility helicopters.  This report has been completed by the board and is currently the subject of detailed consideration by senior civil and military management in my Department. I expect the report to be submitted to me in due course.As the Deputy will appreciate, replacing the rotary aircraft of the Air Corps with modern aircraft would involve significant cost and can only be considered on the basis of prioritised requirements, having regard to available resources. I am committed to maintaining the Air Corps' role in the provision of SAR services, and to this end, the S61 helicopter is being acquired for the Air Corps to operate in the north-west region as a replacement for the Dauphin helicopter. The S61 is being leased by the Irish Coast Guard from CHCI pursuant to existing SAR contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coast Guard to the Air Corps.The Air Corps is providing the flight crews and the aircraft is being maintained by CHCI. All of the costs of this operation are being met from my Department's Vote. The S61 will operate out of Sligo Airport, where training is currently on-going. It is expected that the helicopter will go operational for daylight hours this month, with a full 24-hour service operational from October 2003.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	503	It is almost a year since members of the Air Corps received the shocking news that the long-promised and badly-needed medium lift helicopters had been cancelled. At the time, the message was given by the Minister that it was only a temporary decision due to emerging financial difficulties. We were told that the alternative options would be explored. A year on, we are no closer to a decision. How many times has this interdepartmental group met? What was the last occasion on which it met, and what was the decision, in plain language, on this question?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	504	It was equally disappointing for me that I could not proceed with that particular development. Having consulted with the Air Corps, it gave me what I understood to be a new priority at the time – the trainer aircraft. I was in a position in January to sign the contract for eight trainer aircraft, which will be delivered between March and June of 2004 at a cost of €60 million. That was the priority that was given to me by the Air Corps.The work of the working group on the options open to me for the acquisition of helicopters is on-going, and I expect to have a report fairly soon. I can give the Deputy the details he has requested by way of letter as I cannot provide them off the top of my head now. An extensive study is being conducted on the alternative methods that could be put in place.However, we are in a changed financial circumstance. I have tried to equip the Air Corps and improve Baldonnel by making a significant investment not just in aircraft but also in the accommodation hangar and other developments. We have been trying to do that in the last few years mainly through the sale of properties surplus to our requirements. It is not easy, however, and in the present financial circumstances I do not want to get into commitments which I do not see any way of fulfilling at present. The S61 is going to cost about €16 million over a three-year period, so dealing with that, maintaining search and rescue in the north-west, purchasing the trainer aircraft and continuing to improve facilities at Baldonnel are very significant investments that are without parallel in any previous Administration.I do not want to raise hopes too high as to what more I will be able to do in the immediate future because of the significantly changed financial situation, the tightness with which Estimates have to be done and the limitations that may be in front of me in terms of the possibilities for sale of additional properties.

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Is the Minister telling the Air Corps that there is little likelihood of the helicopters being supplied? Can this be attributed, in some respects, to the fact that the Government's vanity project of new ministerial jets is being provided for? Are there any plans to privatise parts of the air sea rescue services dealing with the maintenance of helicopters?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	507	The maintenance of the S61 is being done by CHCI. As the Deputy knows, a considerable amount of the search and rescue services is being conducted by private services. I want to maintain, as far as I can, the Air Corps' stronghold in this area. That is one of the reasons I was involved in such a significant investment in the S61 for the north-west. That will continue as far as I can possibly do it.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	508	It has now become clear that the new financial situation and constraints will apply specifically to the helicopter project for the Defence Forces but will obviously not apply to the replacement of the Government's own air fleet – the twin jet project. Has provision been made in the Estimates, alongside the considerations that might be given to the twin jet project, for a recovery of the project to supply helicopters to the Air Corps, having particular regard to the capabilities of the helicopters and the obvious need to upgrade and update the helicopter unit on an ongoing basis? Is it possible to enter into financial negotiations with those who are in the business of supplying such helicopters to do so on the same basis as is likely to apply in the case of the Government jets?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I should have mentioned this in the context of my reply to Deputy Sherlock, but one should not underestimate the work of the Air Corps in terms of ministerial transport. Those, like Deputies Durkan and Hogan, who have had the opportunity to serve in Government will be fully aware of its engagement in the provision of the MATS transport service to the Government, which is extremely busy, constant and involves considerable training in the initial stages and significant opportunities for the Air Corps.All of the possibilities with regard to the acquisition of helicopters are being explored, but I would face difficulties in terms of meeting all of the requirements at the one time. The building of the hangar, the other work that has taken place on the helicopter wing, the purchase of the trainer aircraft and the purchase of the additional ministerial jets and the S61 for the north-west have involved very substantial expenditure and have given a massive boost to the Air Corps.One must consider that very little had been purchased for the Air Corps and that Baldonnel was very run down when I became Minister. I undertook to tackle all of these problems as best I could. To do all of that in the one era is not possible, and I do not want to hold out the hope that I can do it all contemporaneously.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	510	In terms of priority, does the Minister agree that these helicopters are far more important than Government jets? Does he agree that what is required is some lateral thinking in order that expenditure could be saved on the purchase of Government jets, if such jets were leased? Can the Minister explain why he previously made a statement that it would be preferable to purchase rather than to lease when according to the figures I have been given, savings to the Exchequer of up to 65% could be made if we entered some sort of timeshare arrangement? Will the Minister agree to examine this matter to ascertain whether we can save money in one area in order that we can prioritise other areas?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	511	The Deputy appears to have slightly misunderstood what I said earlier. Generally speaking, nine times out of ten or 99 times out of 100, it is best to be in a position to make an outright purchase, to pay down the full amount when buying a significant item. This does not only apply to aircraft but to other large purchases. I did not say I was in a position to do that; I said that if one were, it would generally be the preferred option. Once one transfers into future payments, one is caught up with interest payments accruing. There are few circumstances where it could be proved that such an option does not cost more money in the long run. I have examined many options where such an option ultimately costs one more money. Assuming that one may have to go down that road because of financial constraints, that option is being examined. With the changed financial circumstances in which I have to operate, I do not want to get into the business of saying that I can get trainer aircraft which will cost €60 million and which will be delivered between next March and June; that I can continue the investment programme in Baldonnel, the cost of which is running up to €14 million or €15 million; that I can acquire the jets; and that all of this can be achieved in a short number of years when one considers the backdrop of what was not done in the past and what may have to be left undone for the future. I do not want to get into further commitments until I know exactly what I am in a position to do.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 91 together.Members of the Defence Forces are prohibited from belonging to trade unions and, as a consequence, their representative associations are not affiliated to the ICTU. This means that the associations do not participate directly in the negotiations between the social partners which have led to national agreements.In the course of discussions on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, agreement was reached with the Defence Forces representative associations on a framework which would facilitate them engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between the social partners at national level. Under the terms of this agreement, representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Defence and the military authorities met collectively and separately with representatives of PDFORRA and RACO. These meetings were supplemented by a number of bilateral meetings involving the various parties. This process ensured that the associations were fully aware of developments at the central discussions while at the same time having a forum to raise matters of particular concern to them.Based on the established model, parallel discussions with the Defence Forces representative associations on how the Public Service Benchmarking Body's recommendations on achieving modernisation, flexibility and change can be implemented in the Defence Forces commenced on 22 October 2002, and are continuing. I am satisfied that these arrangements have in the past, and will in the future, provide an opportunity for the Defence Forces representative associations to engage in a meaningful way with the social partnership discussions.In expectation of a successful conclusion to these discussions and anticipating that the Defence Forces representative associations will accept the Sustaining Progress agreement, an allocation of €14 million has been made in the Revised 2003 Estimate for my Department. This allocation provides for payment of the benchmarking awards, including the arrears due from 1 December 2001.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Is it accepted by the Government, in principle, that members of the Defence Forces should receive the benchmarking award? If that is the case, when will it be paid, given that public service workers, including members of the staff of these Houses, have already received their first payments? Will he indicate the position?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I do not want to pre-empt the outcome to the ongoing talks between the representative associations and the official side. Once that process is concluded, both associations will be balloted. If the outcome is favourable, which I hope it will be, provision has been made in the Estimate for this year for that payment. I would ensure that such payment would be made between three to four weeks after the agreement was ratified.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I have a record of what the Minister said on 15 May. If he is opposed to members of the Defence Forces having the right to strike, what is his attitude to members of the Defence Forces having some association with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions? Many changes have occurred in latter years. Would there be any objection to the members of the Defence Forces having an association with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in order that Defence Forces personnel could have a direct voice and say in future partnership talks?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I am obviously opposed to the military going on strike. There is a well recognised international position in that regard. I would much rather approach this matter on the basis of working closely with the associations, dealing with the problems they have as they arise, increasing investment in equipment, accommodation, uniforms or whatever and ensuring that the promotional ladder and general opportunities for development within the Defence Forces are enhanced. That is a much better approach than trying to deal with circumstances where the associations or their military people would see the necessity to go on strike. I am sure the Deputy would agree that the manner in which we work with the associations, members of which the Deputy has met at conferences, has progressed dramatically in ten years. There was a major resistance to the establishment of these associations in the beginning but that is no longer the case and now there is a good working relationship which assists both sides. There is also the conciliation and arbitration process where meetings arranged between the associations and the official side are held on a continual basis.On the other side, we have worked hard with the associations to be able to have parallel arrangements in the pay talks, which means that they are very au fait and up to date with all the developments that are taking place. That seems to be the most satisfactory way we can progress this matter at present. There is a document which one of the associations presented to me recently, at which I have only had an opportunity to have a preliminary glance. I will consider that over the next few weeks to ascertain to what extent we can improve the facilities in place.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	517	How do the pay and conditions of our Defence Forces compare to those of defence forces in other EU states? What plans has the Minister to bring the pay and conditions of our Defence Forces up the EU ladder? How would the Minister characterise his relationship with the representatives of the Defence Forces given that in the past we have observed at conferences that relations were strained to say the least?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Yes, they were quite strained. There were difficulties around my approach to dealing with the hearing impairment claims, the debate on the White Paper, the reduction in the number of personnel and they were difficult circumstances for everyone involved. There was the disposal and sale of barracks and many issues culminated which did not make matters easy for me or anybody else involved. We worked through all that and I am sure the Deputy would have noticed at the conferences in the past two years that there has been a different approach and significant co-operation on many points, which I very much appreciate. The associations have matured in their approach, which is understandable because we were dealing with structures that were in an embryonic stage in terms of representative associations and the acceptability thereof.It is working extremely well and we want that to continue. We have had consensus in the House too on a lot of issues, which helped me to secure that position. We are very well up the ladder in terms of salaries, wages and conditions, and in a few areas we are well ahead. There are very few circumstances in the world where pensions are paid after 12 years' service, or after 21 years' service for that matter. These may be difficult positions to hold on to in the longer term but changes do not affect existing personnel, and the changes have to be agreed one way or another. The Deputies can be assured that while we are not at the top of the ladder, there are certainly not too many steps left for us to take. In some areas we are well ahead.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	519	On the question of association with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for Army personnel so that they would have a direct say and voice in the whole matter of partnership, what is the Minister's attitude?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	520	Again I will answer this my way, rather than fulfil the Deputy's expectations. There is no real possibility of that linkage, or full marriage, to take place, if that is the meaning behind the Deputy's question. What we have tried to do is organise the parallel talks and make sure that nothing happened in the pay talks and the social partnership generally about which the Defence Forces were in the dark. We have managed to bring that process a long way and we have had very considerable support from the Taoiseach in trying to develop it.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	521	This is with reference to Army personnel and Government personnel.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	522	Yes.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Why then did the Minister not agree to the association with the congress?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	524	What I said was that I did not expect that would happen. It is not a question of my agreement. I am not involved in that.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	525	The Gulfstream IV jet operates to and from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel or Dublin Airport, depending on the mission profile and whichever location is most suited to the overall needs of the travelling group. The mission profile may dictate landings-take-off from Dublin Airport for a number of reasons. The limitations of the navigation approach aids in Baldonnel mean that the aircraft sometimes has to divert to Dublin Airport where the approach aids allow aircraft to land in much poorer weather conditions. When the Gulfstream IV is departing on a transatlantic or transcontinental flight it may require a longer runway than is available at Baldonnel. Due to runway or airfield maintenance at Baldonnel, the aircraft would have to operate out of Dublin, as was the case for a three-month period during 2002 when all flights departed from Dublin Airport due to the runway being resurfaced at Baldonnel. Decisions in relation to these issues are made by the Air Corps on operational and safety grounds.The vast majority of ministerial flights, particularly over the past few years, have departed from Baldonnel. The number of flights made by the Gulfstream IV jet between Baldonnel and Dublin Airport in each of the past five years is as follows: 1998, 28 Baldonnel to Dublin flights and 36 from Dublin to Baldonnel; 1999, 31 Baldonnel to Dublin flights and 32 from Dublin to Baldonnel; 2000, 30 Baldonnel to Dublin flights and 31 from Dublin to Baldonnel; 2001, 15 Baldonnel to Dublin flights and 14 from Dublin to Baldonnel; 2002, nine Baldonnel to Dublin flights and 17 from Dublin to Baldonnel.The Deputy can see from the figures that there has been a steady decline in the number of such short hops undertaken. In any event, these flights represent only a small percentage of the overall number of flights undertaken by the Gulfstream IV aircraft. Some 92% of flights originate from Baldonnel.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Does the Minister agree that the other 8% of flights are very often for the convenience of the Taoiseach and Ministers? Will he tell the House roughly how much extra is spent as a consequence of leaving from Dublin Airport, as opposed to Baldonnel, in terms of aviation fuel and wear and tear? I listened carefully to the Minister's reply. Did I hear him correctly in so far as I think he said that when travelling to the US, Dublin Airport is used because of a longer runway?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	527	I will perhaps wait until the Deputy has concluded.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I am not an expert in this area and yet, clearly, for the first time in my life, I am a bit more of an expert than Deputy Gormley. That is a fantastic achievement for me because I do not recall a time when I thought that would happen. The reason for leaving from Dublin Airport, which has a longer runway, is simple. It depends on the number of people on the aircraft. If it is full, with perhaps 14 people, and is fully fuelled, it cannot leave from Baldonnel. That was the case on a number of occasions, making it essential to fly from Dublin Airport. Does Deputy Gormley not realise that sometimes he gets things wrong?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I am looking for clarification.

If, for instance, in any examination that the Deputy has ever been involved in, the examiner awarded marks of 92%, the Deputy would be extremely happy with that result. Some 92% of flights take off from Baldonnel and in terms of overall wear and tear, the small hops made to Dublin certainly make an infinitesimally small difference. If the Deputy looked at the bigger picture it would be an enormous help to his party and to me.

I am sure he will be very good in the arts. I have no difficulty with this amendment and my party will not vote against it. I recognise the fact that Deputy Ó Snodaigh noticed this on Report Stage and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism made a commitment that he would rectify it by making an amendment in the Seanad and bringing it back to the Dáil.This gives an opportunity to have a brief overview of the Bill. We have been discussing the Bill for more than a year.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	537	We are discussing the amendment. We cannot have a general discussion on the Bill.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	538	Given that we are discussing the five-year term of the chairperson, I feel it would be appropriate to discuss the issue of membership of the council. The number of members on the council will now be between what was provided for in the 1951 and 1973 Acts. The 1951 Act provided for six members and a director. The 1973 Act provided for 16 members and a chairman. This Bill provides for 12 members and a chairman. While it is not a radical change, it will probably improve the workings of the council, as 17 people around a table was a large number, which may not have facilitated smooth decision making.On the other hand it could lead to less representation of the various interests across the arts community, in which there has been a proliferation of groups in recent years. No doubt that has come about as a result of the success of the arts in that period. In addition, there are now more groups representing the performing arts and the visual arts than was previously the case.Whatever about the term of office of the chairperson, the big question relates to funding. The reduction of €4 million in the allocation to the Arts Council this year has given rise to widespread concern and despair across the arts community. Groups such as Ballet Ireland have had their budgets slashed. Groups like Red Kettle and Siamsa Tíre have to curtail their programmes because of the cut in Arts Council funding. Despite this Bill, unless there is a commitment to funding and the Government fulfils its commitment to the arts world to support the arts plan 2002 to 2006, which had committed €53 million to the arts for this year—

Níl freagraí leis na ceisteanna seo ann seachas an tréimhse.The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism was sympathetic to a point I raised on the previous Stage of this Bill concerning functions. While he agreed with me on the position of artists, he said that he was not introducing a social welfare Bill. I directed my attention to section 18 of the Bill which gives the Minister the power to confer on the Arts Council through the chairperson – regardless of his or her term – the ability, for example, to make the case for the living conditions of artists.While I cannot ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, while dealing with an arts Bill, to introduce a social welfare Bill, if I interpret the section correctly there is nothing preventing the Minister from asking the new council and its chairperson to address this as it is a matter of the greatest urgency. I would appreciate the Minister of State covering it in his summary before we finish.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	549	A number of points were raised with regard to the amendment from the Seanad. Section 11 specifies the length of time that ordinary members of the council shall serve. No reference was made in the original Bill to the term of appointment of the chairperson. This issue, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh pointed out, was raised on Report Stage in the Dáil. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, indicated that he proposed to make an amendment. It was always his intention that the chairperson should serve for a term of five years. That is what is proposed in the amendment. The Bill has been amended in the Seanad and the Dáil is asked to agree to this amendment. I welcome the fact that Deputies are in agreement and thank them for raising the issue on Report Stage.Naturally, Deputies used the opportunity of the re-submission of the Bill to raise other issues. Deputy Deenihan raised the whole question of the size of the board and the great variety and diversity of the arts community nowadays. He asked whether the number involved would be sufficient to cater for the huge diversity of interests involved. There is no doubt there has been an increase in the variety of stakeholders in the arts community. However, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and this House have to make a practical decision as to an effective and workable body in terms of numbers.The number has been fixed at 13 which seems an unfortunate figure about which I am superstitious. However, a balance must be struck. An odd number is always preferable and a decision can be made in the event of division of opinion. Once committees are expanded beyond a certain size, they tend to become too unwieldy. We are fortunate that under the Constitution, the number of Cabinet members is limited to 15. Successive taoisigh would have long since trespassed beyond that figure and made Government a pointless entity. Naturally, they have explored the idea of having Ministers of State in attendance in recent years. The reality is that in fixing a number, one makes a committee more effective. As Deputy Deenihan pointed out, the original figure was far smaller and there was a much greater figure in the 1970s legislation. There was a figure of 73 in the last Act. We are now fixed on a figure of 13, which in the circumstances is balanced.Deputy Deenihan raised the issue of the reduction in funding. The Government never committed itself to financial targets in the arts plan. It was made clear that funding would come through the annual Estimates provisions. We cannot be accused of any deceptions in our undertaking to the people in this case. I will draw the Deputy's views to the attention of the Minister. Deputy Deenihan also said that the Minister's view of the legislation – this could ultimately fall to be determined by the courts – means the board is autonomous on funding decisions.Bhí cúpla ceist ag an Teachta Ó Snodaigh. Beidh an tréimhse céanna ag an gcathaoirleach agus atá ag gnáthduine a bheith mar bhall den choiste – níl aon difríocht ann. Mar a deir an Bille in alt 11(9): "A person to whom subsection (8) applies shall not be eligible for re-appointment to the council where he or she has served two consecutive terms of office as a member of the council."  Tá an cathaoirleach faoin chosc sin chomh maith.Ar cheist na haoise, ní féidir cosc aoise a chur isteach mar tá seans go mbeadh sé míbhunreachtúil i reachtaíocht. Tagann ciall le haois agus ní féidir a rá sa Bhille go mbeadh aois éigin ann nach mbeadh duine in ann bheith mar bhall den bhord.

I have no precise indications from the Minister as to his intentions in this regard. There is no doubt in my mind that it would be open to the Minister under section 10 to adopt the course of action the Deputy proposed.

However, he rejected it by specifying that he would set up a standing committee for the artists.On the term of the chairperson, there is other legislation that does not specify how long a chairperson can remain in office. Bord na gCon is a case in point. It is important that a finite period would be specified where a chairperson could remain in office. It is important too that the person appointed to that position has a long track record in the arts. He or she should have a broad overview of the arts and not just represent a sector in the arts. Otherwise, that particular viewpoint could prevail to the detriment of other sectors.The Minister's appointment to Fáilte Ireland was a good one, so I believe he will appoint somebody dynamic with a vision for the arts in the future. This is important as the arts area is going through a turbulent period despite the fact that considerable progress has been made. Deputy Michael Higgins, when Minister, was partly responsible for that, but there is a great deal of concern now. The chairperson, who will be appointed for five years, will be important in guiding the arts over that period in giving people confidence and assurance and providing the required vision.

As he is no doubt aware, in many states in the United States, there has been considerable political discussion about whether there should be a fixed term for members of Congress, state legislatures and governors. This may lead on to a discussion as to whether, for example, in this House one should not be allowed to be a Deputy for more than three terms or a Minister for more than two.

Those of us involved in it learned a lot about the working and make-up of the Arts Council. We also learned a great deal from contacts with various groups about what is currently happening in the wider arts world.I also recognise the work of the Arts Council officials who were most helpful in providing information at all times to committee members, and Members in general.I hope the legislation will have the desired effect of improving the status of the arts and providing the necessary institutional support to ensure the arts will thrive. The success of the legislation depends on the Government response in providing the funding required to ensure that the various provisions in the Bill can be implemented. Overall, it was a useful exercise.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	563	As we conclude the passage of the legislation, one can only hope that the principles that were debated on all Stages, most importantly the one relating to the autonomy of the Arts Council, are respected. An arts council without full autonomy that would simply serve the Government of the day would have lost the critical capacity to serve the arts, not just the community of artists but the entire public.There is one other point which I think is very important, and I am not going to repeat it to the point of tedium. An arts council must be something to which the artists themselves should be able to look, both in terms of the protection of their integrity and their imagination, but particularly regarding their right to exist. As I have said on previous Stages, we have an artistic community that is living on the edge. It does not qualify for housing and is badly treated under social welfare. It is living in total insecurity.I wish the procedures that come out of the legislation well. I welcome the changes made by the Minister on different Stages.As a former Minister in this area, I think it was an extraordinarily sad day for Ireland, and for Europe, when we decided to abolish the term "culture" in this general area. It was a regressive step, taken for all the wrong reasons and the diffusion of responsibility for the arts, which this legislation will only partially recover, is to be deeply regretted.

It is the third occasion on which the Houses of the Oireachtas have explored the whole question of how we provide in statutory terms for the arts.I assure Deputy Michael D. Higgins that the independence of the council is guaranteed in the Bill in the context of any discussions on funding.I also share some sympathy with his plea for impoverished artists, who should be the ones about whom we are most concerned. A section in the Bill provides a mechanism in regard to them.Deputy Deenihan laid particular stress in his conclusion on the importance of funding. There is no doubt that there are many competing priorities for the attention of Government and funding is one of them. Funding of the arts is always a difficult subject and, as Deputies, we are aware of the strong demands of local areas compared to the importance of developing centres of national excellence. That has always been a difficulty in the funding of the arts.Deputy Ó Snodaigh made the point that it is important that that which is specifically Irish in our identity is fostered in the arts.

The amendment states that the Minister may by order provide for the commencement of this Act on a date earlier than the passing hereof where necessary to comply with Council Directive 1999/70/EC.The Ceann Comhairle will be aware that the EC directive which spawned this Bill goes back to 1999. The original directive gave us until July of 2001—

However, I want to make a point before we move from the amendment. There will be an implication in terms of liability to the State because we have a legal obligation from July 2002 to implement it. It will be possible for people to take action against us. I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting the amendment or retabling it in his name so that he will have the option of implementing the legislation at an earlier date if, on further reflection and legal advice, that proves to be a prudent option.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	576	I remake my appeal to the Minister of State. I know the Minister is indisposed and I wish her a speedy recovery – she had a minor upset. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, dealt with this Bill in the other House. He put on the record of that House a response to this amendment which stated that it would be expensive to do as it proposes and, therefore, we should not. However, the directive goes back to 1999 and we had until 10 July 2001 to implement it. There was a possibility of a one year extension for special difficulty beyond 2001 which, in exceptional circumstances, would have allowed us to transpose this into domestic law in July 2002. That has not happened. There will be serious costs and legal implications unless the protection envisaged in this legislation is made retrospective to at least the 2002 date. That is the good legal advice I have been given. I ask the Minister of State to reflect further on it and to see if he can, even at this late stage, submit an amendment in his own name to give him the option of implementing the legislation at an earlier date. It would be a prudent, wise and cost-saving measure.

It states that the Minister "may" by order provide a commencement date prior to the enactment date. It gives the Minister flexibility. I am familiar with civil servants providing great flexibility to Ministers in legislation because, on mature reflection, to borrow a phrase, it can sometimes be prudent to do that. If the Minister wants to commence it from the date of enactment, that is not precluded in any way by him retabling amendment No. 1 in his own name. It just gives the Minister flexibility, which would be prudent.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 6, subsection (1), lines 2 to 8, to delete all words from and including "but" in line 2 down to and including "contract)" in line 8.I want to amend the definition section of the Bill which states that a "contract of employment" means a contract of service whether express or implied and, if express, whether oral or in writing. I want to delete all the words from and including "but" down to and including "contract)". The impact of the amendment would be to narrow the exclusions which are implicit in the Bill. The objective of altering those exclusions would be to include or to delete the exclusion of agency workers. This issue was raised in the debate in the Seanad. I read with interest the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, on this issue. He gave an explicit commitment that this was an important and valuable thing to do. I do not want to take up the time of a confined debate to read the full text of his comments in the Seanad, but the import of what he said was that it was the correct course of action. He stated:I consider it appropriate that such workers should now be included in the scope of the Bill. It will be necessary to secure agreement from the Government for their inclusion but such agreement will not be possible prior to Report and Final Stages. I intend to report on this matter on Committee Stage in the Dáil and update this House after the passage of the Bill in the other House.In other words, he gave a commitment to the other House that he would make the amendment I have proposed when the Bill arrived in this House. We welcome that commitment and we would be happy to accept the Minister of State's proposal in that regard.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I was amazed that the Bill included a provision to exclude people on fixed-term contracts with agencies. Many people, particularly those who work in the secretarial field, are on such contracts. There is no reason they should be excluded. I look forward to an explanation for that. It discriminates against people who, as far as I can see from newspaper advertisements, increasingly use agencies. If the amendment is not accepted, there is a strong possibility we will be back to amend it sooner rather than later. I ask the Minister of State to give this serious consideration.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	585	I thank Deputies Howlin and Morgan for tabling this amendment. The exclusion of agency workers from the scope of the Bill was specifically raised by a number of Deputies during the Second Stage debate on 26 June. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, who stood in on my behalf as I was engaged in the ILO conference during that week, gave a commitment that the Government would report on this matter on Committee Stage in the Dáil. However, he did not give a commitment to make the change but to look at it. He also proposed to update the Seanad of any developments after the passage of the Bill through the House.The exclusion was done in accordance with the terms of the framework agreement on fixed-term work annexed to Directive 1999/70/EC which provided that the agreement applies to fixed-term workers with the exception of those placed by a temporary work agency at the disposition of a user enterprise. That was done for a variety of reasons, not least the intention since the beginning to deal with part-time, fixed-term and temporary agency workers separately. Although the first two agreements finally reached by the social partners at European level were similar in nature, that is, in the cases of the part-time and fixed-term workers directives, this was achieved through discussion of each type of work. However, negotiations on a temporary agency workers directive among the social partners at a European level broke down in May 2001 and a draft directive in the area was subsequently published by the European Commission in March 2002. This draft directive remains under discussion in Brussels.Although it is somewhat unclear how the Italian Presidency proposes to advance the temporary agency dossier, we understand that the Italians will continue to work on the proposal with a view to possibly reaching political agreement during their Presidency, which ends in December. Accordingly, under the definition of a contract of employment in section 2 of the Bill, agency workers who agree with a person who is carrying on the business of an employment within the meaning of the Employment Agency Act 1971 and who is acting in the course of that business to do or perform personally any work or service for a third person, whether or not the third person is party to the contract, are excluded from the ambit of the legislation because of the above provision in the framework agreement on fixed-term work.However, agency workers who have a contract of employment directly with an employment agency are covered by the Bill. In those cases, the employment agency is the employer as defined in the Bill. This means that the Deputy's requirement is provided for. For these reasons, I propose to reject amendment No. 2. I trust that the explanation I have just given clarifies matters for the Deputies. There were three directives on part-time work, fixed-term workers and agency workers respectively. The issue raised by the Deputies is covered in this Bill and will be further covered in the Bill dealing with agency workers when it comes before the House.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	586	The Minister is being disingenuous in the statements he attributed to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern. I have in front of me Deputy Ahern's comments in the Seanad. The reasoning in the preamble to these comments was identical to that which Deputy Fahey has just given. He mentioned that there was a separate directive and that it was envisaged that would be advanced. He said that negotiations broke down in 2001 and the draft directive in the area was subsequently published by the European Commission in March 2002. All of this echoes Deputy Ahern's comments in the Seanad. However, he then went on to say:I consider it appropriate that such workers should now be included in the scope of the Bill. It will be necessary to secure agreement from the Government for their inclusion but such agreement will not be possible prior to Report and Final Stages [in the Seanad]. I intend to report on this matter on Committee Stage in the Dáil and to update this House after the passage of the Bill in the other House.The truth seems to be that Deputy Ahern was unable to obtain Government agreement to broaden the scope of the Bill – to delete the exclusion of agency workers. Telling us now that it will be dealt with in another Bill some other time is well and good – we will welcome the implementation of the directive that applies to agency workers – but, in the interim, we should take the measure of including agency workers, or not excluding them from the terms of this legislation, as was clearly the intention of Deputy Ahern and of Deputy Fahey. If the Minister of State could not get the agreement of the Government, he should at least stand up and tell us that in order that we will know the reasons for it. It is disingenuous to say that it was never intended to do that when it is as plain as a pikestaff that was the intention.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I am carefully reading the paragraph that Deputy Howlin and I are seeking to delete to see whether I can capture the essence of what the Minister of State is saying. I find it unclear. I understand the Minister of State is suggesting that the employee is covered by a contract that exists between the contract agency and him or her. A contract exists between the two parties similar to that which exists in the case of somebody who is employed directly by the company for whom she or he works. The Minister of State claims that this contract will suffice. If that is the case, I do not see why temporary agency workers should be excluded here. I look forward to the Minister of State's explanation for this because it is not clear on reading the section we are trying to delete. It would lead to a considerably more straightforward Bill if the paragraph were deleted entirely.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	588	The Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, gave the view as outlined, but we did not go to Government with this request. It was a decision on my part and that of my officials that it would be more appropriate to deal with agency workers under the directive being negotiated in Europe specifically for agency workers, which will be the subject of legislation at a later date. In reply to Deputy Morgan's question, agency workers who have a contract of employment with a temporary agency are covered by this Bill. It does not cover workers who are contracted out to other employers, but they will be dealt with in the directive, which is specifically for their benefit.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I am confused. I know that when one Minister of State replaces another during a debate – I understand that Deputy Fahey had to attend a meeting of the ILO – he or she normally works from a prepared script. Somebody prepared the script and handed it to Deputy Ahern, who then said that he considered it appropriate for this legislation to encompass agency workers. That position has now changed. It surprises me that Deputy Fahey could overturn that view after it had been given in a House of the Oireachtas.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	593	The bottom line is that is what he said. Did Deputy Fahey overrule that and if so, why? The Minister of State said that there would be another Bill once a directive is agreed upon. Firstly, the directive has not even been concluded. The Minister of State has already told the House that he does not know the status of the directive in the Italian Presidency – it may well fall to us to conclude it during our own Presidency. Once it is concluded, when will it be enshrined in legislation? Let us take this Bill as a typical example. The directive with which this Bill deals was concluded in 1999, so the Bill dealing with the other directive should appear four years from now.It is wrong to exclude a category of workers from the protections offered in this Bill in the hope that in three, four or five years' time, a specific directive relating to this category will be transposed into domestic law. I ask the Minister of State to think again. Could he explain to us why he has reversed the position clearly enunciated as the Government's position, given that Ministers speak for the Government in a collective constitutional capacity? A clear commitment was given to the Seanad to include agency workers in this legislation.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	594	The framework agreement on fixed-term work annexed to Directive 1999/70/EC states:This agreement applies to fixed-term workers with the exception of those placed by a temporary work agency at the disposition of a user enterprise. It is the intention of the parties to consider the need for a similar agreement relating to temporary agency work.Therefore, as in the case of every other country in Europe, temporary agency workers will be catered for when the directive relating to them is agreed on. It is for that reason that the advice of my officials – and my own view – is that temporary agency workers and part-time workers should be covered by the specific directive being put through in Europe at present. That is why we reject the amendment.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	595	It is not only unfortunate but also unfair that such a wide range of workers will be excluded from the protection of this Bill until the EU manages to put in place a directive dealing with this matter. Goodness only knows when that will happen.Meanwhile, it would be better to delete this and include them in the legislation proper, thus giving them the entitlements enjoyed by other employees.

In page 7, subsection (1)(b), line 7, after “any” to insert “monetary”.As the Bill implements an EU directive, it gives rise to few matters warranting criticism or amendment. It is a non-controversial Bill, which is to be welcomed in principle. I welcome some of the Minister of State's amendments and I support the Labour Party's amendments also. I hope the Minister of State will be more inclined to accept subsequent Opposition amendments because it would be a shame not to do so. This amendment is technical in nature and seeks to add the word "monetary" for purposes of clarification.

In page 7, lines 38 to 41, to delete subsection (2).I am intrigued by the subsection my amendment seeks to delete. Perhaps the Minister of State could explain why he wants this subsection in the Bill. Section 3(2) states:Regulations under this Act may make different provisions in relation to different classes of employees or employers, different areas or otherwise by reference to the different circumstances of the matter.Why does the Minister of State want to give himself broad powers to discriminate between different groups of employees? Why should the Oireachtas blindly grant this power to a Minister through a blanket provision which may have significant implications?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	603	This is already in the part-time legislation.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	604	No.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	605	The amendment would have the effect of deleting section 3(2) which, as drafted, permits different provisions for different classes of employees or employers in regulations or orders made under the terms of the Bill. This is a standard provision in legislation, generally, whereby a Minister can make regulations or orders under an Act of the Oireachtas. A similar provision to section 3(2) was provided for in section 4(2) of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, on which much of the text of this Bill is based.By way of clarification, however, if this section were ever to be used in the future it could not lessen the rights of fixed-term employees, as provided for in this Bill. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	606	I am heartened to hear the Minister of State's assurance that the subsection cannot be used to disimprove the conditions of fixed-term contracted employees, but what is the legal basis for that assurance? The fact that the provision has been replicated in previous legislation does not make it right. Having introduced legislation to the House as a Minister, I am aware that empowering sections can give broad-ranging secondary legislative powers to Ministers. This suits departmental officials because it gives them the scope to make law without reference to the Oireachtas. When I read the subsection, it was not clear why this power was required. How can we be certain that it will be delimited, as the Minister of State has assured us? What compelling legal basis is there for his assurance?

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 9, subsection (1), line 4, to delete "subsection (2)” and substitute “subsections (2) and (5)”.As a consequence of amendment No. 7, it is necessary to include a reference to section 6(5) in line 4, page 9. Amendment No. 7 would prohibit a part-time employee from comparing himself or herself to a full-time employee for pension purposes, if he or she has worked less than 20% of the hours of a full-time employee.The view expressed by the Department of Finance and the Department of Social and Family Affairs is that a part-time, fixed-term employee could compare himself or herself to a full-time, permanent employee, in which case it would be necessary to limit comparison regarding pensions to those who work at least 20% of the hours of their comparators.To be consistent with the part-time work Act 2002, the new section 6(5), as drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, provides for the avoidance of doubt. The new section 6(6) is a consequential amendment to the new section 6(5) and is also in line with the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, where obviously the protection of employees provision is always comparing himself or herself to the employee who works more hours than he or she does. In other words, the pro rata principle would become applicable in respect of pay or other conditions of employment dependent on hours worked. This is covered by the new section 6(7).Section 6(8) provides for the avoidance of doubt that Part III of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, relating to public holiday entitlements, is not affected by the provisions of this Bill.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	611	I am concerned about the Minister of State's proposals, particularly subsection (5) in amendment No. 7, which states:Subsection (1) shall, in so far, but only in so far, as it relates to any pension scheme or arrangement, not apply to a fixed-term employee whose normal hours of work constitute less than 20 per cent of the normal hours of work of a comparable permanent employee.I am advised that there is no provision in the directive that permits the exclusion from the pension scheme of fixed-term contract workers who work less than 20% of the normal hours of work of a comparable permanent employee. There is no provision in the directive that allows the Minister of State to do what he wishes to do in this case. There is nothing in the part-time work directive that permits that exclusion. The Minister of State says that these subsections mirror those in the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, and so they do because they are similar. It is the view of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that both pieces of legislation may be in breach of the provisions of both directives. I would welcome the Minister of State's response to that point because the ICTU has very long experience in analysing and monitoring the legal impact of directives. It intends to challenge the Government if it persists in regard to this matter.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	612	As I stated on the Order of Business, it has been difficult to check the legality and constitutionality of this important legislation or whether it complies with the directive, given the rush to pass it through the House. I am interested in the Minister of State's reply to Deputy Howlin's point but I would go slightly further. Are we in danger, regardless of the Bill's legality or compliance with the directive, of encouraging employers towards part-time employment for which pension entitlements are different? This tendency is evident in the economy as it develops. Should we be careful in terms of pointing employers in this direction, which may lead to flexible employment arrangements but may not necessarily be in the best interest of individuals?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	613	This legislation relates to fixed-term contracts, not part-time employment. While concerns were expressed by congress, they were not pursued in the manner outlined by Deputy Howlin. However, given that this provision was included in the legislation on part-time work, it is only correct that it should apply in this legislation.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	614	That is no answer. The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill 2000 has been enacted and congress expressed concerns about the exclusion, which the Minister of State wishes to replicate in this legislation. I only referenced the 2001 Act because he did. I am concerned he is inserting a provision that was not envisaged by the European directive. It is the view of congress and independent legal professionals, to whom I have had limited opportunity to speak today, that the provision is wide open to challenge. Has the Minister of State checked this matter? Did he receive advice from the Attorney General? If so, will he give it to the House?

While congress expressed its unhappiness in the discussions we had, it understood our position in respect of this legislation. We negotiated and agreed many aspects of the legislation. This provision largely applies to the part-time work Act, which is unfinished business in terms of the concerns of congress. The Departments of Finance and Social and Family Affairs felt a part-time worker could not compare himself or herself with a full-time employee.

In page 9, subsection (2), line 9, to delete "objective" and substitute "exceptional".Section 6(1) is the key provision of the legislation, as it prohibits the less favourable treatment of fixed-term employees. Section 6(2) sets out the exceptions to section 6(1) in an unduly wide manner. The subsection is a model of ambiguity because it refers to two vague and unidentified concepts. First, it refers to “a less favourable manner”. This term is not defined and is, perhaps, impossible to define. Second, section 6(2) refers to “objective grounds”, which it attempts to define in section 7. My amendment proposes to delete “objective” and insert “exceptional” to ensure the non-application of this section can only be justified on the basis of rare and exceptional circumstances.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	618	I do not propose to accept the amendment. The words "objective grounds" are necessary and more accurately reflect the wording of the directive. The word "exceptional" would be more vague than the term "objective grounds" and would leave a rights commissioner in a difficult position to adjudicate in favour of the worker.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	619	What is the Minister of State's definition of "objective"?

In page 9, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following subsections:"(5) Subsection (1) shall, in so far, but only in so far, as it relates to any pension scheme or arrangement, not apply to a fixed-term employee whose normal hours of work constitute less than 20 per cent of the normal hours of work of a comparable permanent employee.(6) The extent to which any condition of employment referred to in subsection (7) is provided to a fixed-term employee for the purpose of complying with subsection (1) shall be related to the proportion which the normal hours of work of that employee bears to the normal hours of work of the comparable permanent employee concerned.(7) The condition of employment mentioned in subsection (6) is a condition of employment the amount of benefit of which (in case the condition is of a monetary nature) or the scope of the benefit of which (in any other case) is dependent on the number of hours worked by an employee.(8) For the avoidance of doubt, neither this section nor any other provision of this Act affects the operation of Part III of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.".

In page 9, line 23, after "treatment" to insert "or failure to offer a contract of indefinite duration".The amendment relates to the section the Minister of State referenced in response to Deputy Murphy, which refers to "objective grounds for less favourable treatment". The section states "A ground shall not be regarded as an objective ground for the purposes of any provision of this Part unless it is based on considerations other than the status of the employee concerned as a fixed-term employee and the less favourable treatment. . . ". I propose the addition of the words "or failure to offer a contract of indefinite duration", which would be involved for the employee.The amendment is important because, while section 8 provides a definition of "objective grounds for less favourable treatment", no definition is provided for objective grounds justifying the renewal of a fixed-term contract. Section 9 provides that where an employer proposes to renew a fixed-term contact, the fixed-term employee must be informed in writing by the employer of the objective grounds justifying the renewal of a fixed-term contract and the failure to offer a contract of a more indefinite duration. The amendment would broaden the legislation and would be a welcome addition. I hope the Minister of State will accept it.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	625	The amendment is not appropriate as there is no obligation on an employer to offer a contract of indefinite duration. Section 8(2) only obliges an employer to make a written statement of objective grounds for such failure. That does not extend to an obligation to offer a permanent contract where there are no objective grounds. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I will not pursue the matter because I want to get my teeth into other issues.

In page 9, line 24, after "employee" to insert "(which treatment may include the renewal of a fixed-term employee's contract for a further fixed term)".The amendment is self-explanatory. It seeks to provide, for the purpose of greater clarity, what constitutes "objective grounds" for renewing a fixed-term contract on a fixed-term contract basis only under section 8(2) or the new section 9(5). The amendment had been sought by the ICTU to provide greater clarity.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	628	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 9, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following subsection:"(2) Where, as regards any term of his or her contract, a fixed-term employee is treated by his or her employer in a less favourable manner than a comparable permanent employee, the treatment in question shall (for the purposes of section 6(2)) be regarded as justified on objective grounds, if the terms of the fixed-term employee's contract of employment, taken as a whole, are at least as favourable as the terms of the comparable permanent employee's contract of employment.”.This amendment proposes to insert a new section 7(2) to cover situations where the terms of a fixed-term employee's contract of employment, taken as a whole, in relation to conditions of employment are at least as favourable as the terms of the comparable permanent employee's contract of employment. This provision was sought by the Department of Finance to provide flexibility to employers who might want to provide an attractive package of entitlements in order to attract certain employees to work on a fixed-term contract basis. This amendment follows a similar provision to that in the UK's equivalent legislation on fixed-term work, namely, the fixed-term employees' prevention of less favourable treatment regulations 2002.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I have some concerns about the amendment because the terms are not clear. The new subsection (2) would read as follows:Where, as regards any term of his or her contract, a fixed-term employee is treated by his or her employer in a less favourable manner than a comparable permanent employee, the treatment in question shall (for the purposes of section 6(2)) be regarded as justified on objective grounds, if the terms of the fixed-term employee's contract of employment, taken as a whole, are at least as favourable as the terms of the comparable permanent employee's contract of employment.I suppose that explains why we have lawyers. How will it be determined that the fixed-term employee's contract of employment, taken as a whole, is at least as favourable as the terms of the comparable permanent employee? Those who are dealing with industrial relations on a professional and permanent basis are very concerned about the import of this provision. They believe the new subsection will complicate the relationship between employer and employees and could be used in an attempt to by-pass section 6, which prohibits less favourable treatment. Let us think of concrete examples. One could say, "I am giving you something else instead of", therefore, one is not getting the same conditions of employment but one has access to a company car or whatever. It complicates the business of clear legal rights to treatment. As other speakers said, we have just seen the Minister's amendment in the last 24 hours. The best advice I could get from people who deal with this issue is that it is extremely ambiguous, will complicate employer-employee relationships and bring great uncertainty to the legislation and the rights bestowed within it.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I support Deputy Howlin's view that good industrial relations practices work principally on the basis of flexibility. The Minister is failing to accept the definition of objective grounds being quite harsh, changing to something more soft, and adding this subsection, including words like "the treatment in question shall be regarded as justified on objective grounds" rather than using a word like "may". The section provides an absolute defence to employers in these situations. I ask the Minister to try to make the grounds on which fixed-term contracts can be judged as flexible as possible, particularly the flexibility required to resolve disputes. Most of the disputes, in terms of the definition of fixed-term contracts, will revolve around how employees will be dealt with on the definition of objective grounds. The Minister will make progress if he includes words like "may" rather than "shall".
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	631	This provision seeks to protect the situation where employees – they are not the normal employees – could cherry pick between a pension scheme, a car and a house.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	633	Not too many people at the bottom of the pile will have a pension, a car and a house. Therefore, it was felt that in order to stop people at the top level cherry picking and making comparisons between another person's pension, where there are other elements to the package, the issue should be dealt with as a package. If normal employees are affected, the rights commissioner must adjudicate on the matter. I have no doubt that a rights commissioner would ensure the rights of an employee are protected in such a situation.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	634	Will the Minister accept that the ambiguity I instanced in my initial contribution exists? Will he accept there is a potential to have conflict arising from this new provision and that the professionals involved on a day-to-day basis in industrial relations have advised today that this is the case? In those circumstances, will the Minister look again at the proposal? It appears to me that section 7(1) is sufficient and to add this new subsection will provide uncertainty where there is reasonable certainty and conflict where we do not need any.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	635	I accept there is room for conflict but there is room for conflict in many aspects of labour law. It is a tribute to our labour law that we have a set of industrial relations machinery in place to deal with these issues, which we deal with every day. Any conflict which might exist is a matter for the rights commissioner to decide upon. I do not have a difficulty with that. I take the point the Deputy is making. On balance, however, and given that we are talking about people at the top of the pile, the package regime is the most acceptable. I take the point made by the Deputy – congress have argued this – that it may in instances give rise to conflict which may have to go to a rights commissioner.

In page 9, subsection (1), lines 28 and 29, to delete "as soon as practicable" and substitute "in advance of the commencement date of the contract".This amendment deals with section 8 (1) and the written statements of an employer. The current section reads "Where an employee is employed on a fixed-term contract the fixed-term employee shall be informed in writing as soon as practicable by the employer of the objective condition determining the contract whether it is—." I admit that my amendment was suggested to me by FLAC. It says section 8 (1) obliges an employer to inform an employee who is engaged in fixed-term work in writing as soon as practicable of the objective condition of determining the contract.Surely it is the nature of fixed-term specific purpose contracts that they should be put in writing in advance of the contract beginning and not issued retrospectively as is implied in the section. Otherwise – this appears to be a possibility given the way the section is drafted – an employer could decide some time after the contract what was the objective condition for determining what the contract might be, which seems grossly unfair. It is a legal submission from FLAC and I ask the Minister to give it fair consideration.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	639	My amendment No. 12 deals with the same situation.Section 8 obliges the employer to provide a written statement to the employee stating the date on which the contract will end. However, there is no deadline by which the employer must do this and the words used, "as soon as practicable", are too vague. This amendment proposes to oblige the employer to provide this information within two months of the commencement of employment and this proposal is consistent with the existing requirement in section 3 of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994, which obliges the employer to provide the employee with the terms and conditions of employment within two months of commencing employment.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	640	I thank Deputies Murphy and Howlin for their amendments, which are related. By doing nothing we are doing what Deputy Murphy suggests.I consider the wording in section 8(1), "as soon as practicable", will ensure timely notification of fixed term employees of the objective conditions determining their contracts. In any event, the eight week requirement set out in the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 in relation to the provision by employers to their employees of written statements of the terms of employment of an employee will apply to fixed-term employees in the same manner as it does to all employees employed on contracts of employment – permanent, part time and fixed.I do not propose to accept Deputy Murphy's amendment regarding the insertion of a new section 8(4)(b) after 8(4)(a). It is not appropriate that the rights commissioner and the Labour Court should draw an inference from the mere late submission by an employer of a written statement under section 8. Accordingly I do not propose to accept amendment No. 14 as proposed by Deputy Murphy.

We do not want a situation where permanent and part-time employees would be treated differently to fixed-term workers. They are covered by the 1994 legislation and this is the same situation.

That is what I discern in the reply.People should know the objective terms of their contracts in advance of signing. Does that not sound logical? The notion that it should be provided as soon as practicable thereafter or within a two month time frame seems less than acceptable and less than good practice. If we need to amend the 1994 Act subsequently, so be it, but let us make the best law we can now for the category of workers we are dealing with in this instrument.The Minister should give an objective reason my amendment should not be supported other than simply saying there is a different provision in a different Act, enacted nearly a decade ago. Alternatively, he should give a commitment that the whole matter will be addressed when more comprehensive legislation dealing with labour law is before the House.

"As soon as practicable" means what it says and the situation that pertains in the workplace is that employers act as soon as is practicable. This works well with the 1994 legislation and if there were complaints we might change it, but that is not the case.

In page 9, subsection (4), line 42, after "Act" to insert "or in proceedings under an enactment referred to in section 18”.Section 18 provides for a situation where proceedings can be taken under certain other Acts but which arise in the same circumstances as might give rise to proceedings under this Bill. Procedural matters such as failure to give notice should be relevant to section 18 proceedings as well as under this Act. The addition I propose to subsection (4) will improve the Bill and I hope the Minister accepts it.

There are no provisions under those two Acts comparable to those set out in sections 8(1), (2) and (3) requiring employers to provide written statements. It would therefore not be appropriate under this amendment to provide in effect for amendments to the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2001 and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001. For that reason I do not propose to accept the amendment.

We have labour law compartmentalised into different categories of workers and different types of legislation afford different types of protection. The Minister is keeping them almost in separate boxes but it is appropriate with legislation, as it is in other areas of Government, to make general improvements when we can. If the Minister is of the view that the amendment is a general improvement he should accept it, notwithstanding the fact that he feels it has implications beyond the narrow focus of the Bill.

In page 10, before section 9, to insert the following new section:"9.–(1) Subject to subsection (4), where on or after the passing of this Act a fixed-term employee completes or has completed his or her third year of continuous employment with his or her employer or associated employer, his or her fixed-term contract may be renewed by that employer on only one occasion and any such renewal shall be for a fixed term of no longer than one year.(2) Subject to subsection (4), where after the passing of this Act a fixed-term employee is employed by his or her employer or associated employer on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts and the date of the first such contract is subsequent to the date on which this Act is passed, the aggregate duration of such contracts shall not exceed 4 years.(3) Where any term of a fixed-term contract purports to contravene subsection (1) or (2) that term shall have no effect and the contract concerned shall be deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration.(4) Subsections (1) to(3) shall not apply to the renewal of a contract of employment for a fixed term where there are objective grounds justifying such a renewal.(5) The First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001 shall apply for the purpose of ascertaining the period of service of an employee and whether that service has been continuous.".On 26 June 2003, during Second Stage in the Dáil, and on 10 June 2003, during Committee Stage in the Seanad, section 9 which deals with the use of successive fixed-term contracts, was a major issue. Senator O'Toole tabled an amendment which in effect would cap the total aggregate period of fixed-term contracts at four years. On Committee Stage in the Seanad, my colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, undertook to have the amendment examined in detail and report back on Committee Stage in the Dáil. It will be necessary, as a courtesy to the Seanad, to report back to the Upper House on 4 July if the proposed Government amendment is accepted on Committee Stage here. My Department has been in consultation with the office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government as well as the ICTU and IBEC. In addition, a number of Departments have also been consulted. As a result of these discussions, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government has drafted a revised text for section 9, which is currently set out in amendment No. 15. I will outline the intent of the next text.Section 9(1) provides that subject to section 9(4), where a fixed-term employee completes or has completed three years continuous service with his or her employer, or associated employer, that fixed-term contract may only be renewed once more by the employer for a period of no longer than one year.This will mean that when the Bill is passed, existing employees on fixed-term contracts, who have completed three years continuous service with that employer, may have their contracts renewed once more by the employer and for no longer than one year following which the next renewal shall be deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration, namely, a permanent contract.Section 9(2) provides that where a new fixed-term employee is recruited after the passing of the Bill, a fixed-term employee is employed by his or her employer or associated employer on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts and the date of the first such contract is subsequent to the date on which this Act is passed. The aggregate duration of such contracts shall not exceed four years. Section 9(3) provides that where any term of a fixed-term contract purports to contravene subsections (1) or (2) of section 9, that term shall have no effect and the contract concerned shall be deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration.Section 9(4) provides that the above subsections shall not apply to the renewal of a contract of employment for a fixed term where there are objective grounds justifying such a renewal. Section 9(5) provides that the First Schedule of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973, relating to continuous employment, will determine whether the continuous employment referred to in section 9(1) and (2) is continuous. This is a standard provision in employment rights legislation. This provision in section 9(4) is in line with the equivalent legislation in the UK, namely, the Fixed Term Employees Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment Regulations of 2002. These regulations provide that following a period of four or more years of continuous employment, the next renewal takes effect as a permanent contract unless there are objective grounds for justifying a further renewal.While I acknowledge the ICTU has reservations about allowing for the renewal of a fixed-term contract after four years' continuous service on objective grounds, I stress, however, that the Bill provides for fixed-term employees to take a complaint to the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commissioner if they consider the objective grounds given by the employer do not meet the requirements of section 7, as amended. The various decisions which a rights commissioner can take in such circumstances are set out in section 14(2).In addition, the Government's proposed amendment to section 13, which I will address later, may prevent an employer from dismissing an employee by not renewing a fixed-term contract for the main purpose of avoiding the employee becoming permanent. That is a significant amendment.The objective of amendments Nos. 16, 18 and 19 are met by my amendment No. 15. Amendment No. 17 is a drafting amendment but I prefer the wording of the parliamentary counsel's office. As the text of my amendment improves the provisions in section 9, as drafted, I support it and reject the Opposition amendments Nos. 16, 18 and 19. However, I thank the Deputies for their suggested amendments which were all aimed at improving the text. However, the new text provided by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is better and meets the concerns raised by the Opposition.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	655	I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has addressed the issue. It is a little difficult to go through his amendments in detail in the short time we have to see if they meet the issues we addressed on Second Stage and by way of our amendments. Obviously, the Minister of State's amendments will be passed and will improve the Bill, which I welcome.In regard to subsection (1) of the Minister of State's amendment No. 15, it seems he intends to provide for one more renewal at the end of a continuous three year employment – in other words, one more renewal of a fixed-term contract. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions believed that where there was a continuous three year employment, including numerous renewals, the next one on offer should be a permanent and not a fixed-term contract. This does not go as far as it would have liked, but it is not a matter on which I would go to war.I am more concerned about subsection (4) of amendment No. 15, and perhaps the Minister of State will give us some further insight into the reasoning behind it. Amendment No. 15 will, in essence, be the new section 9 of the Bill. Subsection (4) states "Subsections (1) to (3) [the protections I just welcomed] shall not apply to the renewal of a contract of employment for a fixed term where there are objective grounds justifying such a renewal.” What exactly does that mean? Does it negative, or give the potential to negative, subsections (1) to (3)? Will subsection (4) drive a coach and four through the provisions in the previous subsections? At the very least, this paragraph should be subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of amendment No. 15.

As I understand it, he is arguing that there may be certain instances in which there may be objective grounds for offering somebody a contract each year for five years in a row? Those objective grounds may relate to the nature of the employment or the employer-employee relationship. Will he give examples of the type of employment contract which would provide objective grounds for permission for multi-annual fixed-term contracts?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	662	Where there are objective grounds for an employer giving a fixed-term contract, we do not have a problem. The problem is with the roll-over of successive contracts and the abuse which would occur in that situation.

If money was provided for a particular scheme and people were taken on but the money then ran out, those would be objective grounds.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	665	Will the Minister of State run that by us again?

Is that not the import of this provision? We are not talking about grounds for dismissal but grounds for issuing successive fixed-term contracts.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	668	There is a difficulty finding examples which would make this clear. That is one of the reasons I wish to speak in favour of Deputy Howlin's amendment, which brings clarity to the matter. Although there are often legitimate reasons for employing people on a fixed-term contract for specific purposes, we must recognise that there has always been a tendency towards a high level of abuse of that type of contract. Therefore, the amendment is considerably tighter than the Minister of State's suggestion, particularly given that it is so difficult to find anywhere one could justify it, unless one is a TD perhaps.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	669	I am having difficulty in understanding what exactly the Deputies are getting at. Perhaps they could explain it a bit better.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	670	My understanding of subsection (4) is that it, in a sense, waives the rights that we are setting out in subsections (1) to (3), inclusive, which try to discourage or limit the ability of employers to issue successive one-year fixed-term contracts. I very much welcome that provision in the Bill. Subsection (4) waives that right, as far as I understand, where there are objective grounds for justifying such a renewal. It is hard to understand this without getting into legal technicalities, but it would be useful if an example was provided to demonstrate what is meant by this.For example, would there possibly be objective grounds within the education sector for a series of one-year contracts beyond the provisions set out in subsections (1) to (3), inclusive? Any examples would help us to understand what exactly the Minister of State's amendment to waive the powers on objective grounds means in practice. It is hard for me to understand the basis of those objective grounds if I do not have one example to help me.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	672	The Minister of State asked for clarification of my argument. The Minister of State has managed to confuse me because my understanding is straightforward and my legal adviser examined this. The Minister of State sought, in this new section, to deal with issues that were raised both in the Seanad and on Second Stage in this House relating to the application of successive fixed-term contracts. He has, in a number of subsections, dealt with those issues, but then he comes to subsection (4), which negates the first three subsections.Subsection (4) states that "subsections (1) to (3) shall not apply to the renewal of a contract of employment for a fixed term where there are objective grounds justifying such a renewal." In plain English, this is the reverse of what the Minister of State said in terms of dismissal in the case he outlined in which the money ran out. This provides that where there are objective grounds for giving somebody another one-year fixed-term contract, that is allowable and the protections offered in the previous subsections do not apply. The question I posed at the start is why that provision is there. Is it not a mechanism that will allow a coach and four to be drawn through the provisions we want to insert?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	673	No, it is not. This arises only if the employer has a proven case and puts that case to a rights commissioner.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	674	It is fair to ask what the Minister of State thinks would constitute objective grounds.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	675	In trying to provide legislation, one is providing for a general set of principles.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	676	What was the Minister of State thinking of when he drafted that?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	677	The purpose of subsection (4), as I said already, is to provide for cases where there are objective grounds for justifying such a renewal. As I said, the onus is on the employer to show that he has a proven case. He has to put that to a rights commissioner who adjudicates on the matter.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	678	We do not have an example though. There is no case that we can think of where such grounds would exist at present. There was no such experience in the past and no employers have approached us expressing concern that the legislation might affect their current employment conditions. We do not have a particular example of where objective grounds would apply.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	679	No.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	687	With due respect, I think there is a misunderstanding on the part of Deputy Howlin. He has even confused me. We have brought in a four-year maximum clause, which has been the subject of much negotiation. Therefore, we must have some balance. The legislation provides for a period of four years so if an employer feels that the four years should be exceeded—
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	688	Is the Minister of State talking about four consecutive one-year contracts?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	689	Yes. There must be some balance, and the purpose of the amendment is to allow that balance where an employer wants to exceed that period and can improve his case by going to a rights commissioner. That is the essence of—

As I understand it, the proposal Deputy Howlin has just made would have an effect on the four-year maximum that we have provided for.

On a point of order, we would have to amend subsections (1) and (2) of this new section, obviously deleting the comment "subject to subsection (4)" if we accept the deletion of subsection (4). I suggest to Deputy Howlin that his amendment to the amendment would also require those two other deletions to be effective.

In page 10, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following subsection:"(4) The dismissal of an employee followed by his or her re-employment by the same employer not later than 26 weeks after the dismissal shall not operate to break the continuity of service of the employee with the employer if the dismissal was wholly or partly for or was connected with the purpose of the avoidance of liability under this Act.".
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	698	I move amendment No. 20:
In page 10, subsection (1), line 14, after "to" where it firstly occurs to insert "all".Section 10(1) obliges an employer to inform an employee of vacancies that arise. To what kind of vacancies does this refer? There are vacancies which are suitable in the mind of an employer, vacancies requiring a particular level of skill or vacancies that an employer would have a discretion to offer to an employee. That is why we recommend that all vacancies should be offered to employees.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	699	This amendment is not necessary and, therefore, I do not propose to accept it. It is implicit in the current wording of section 10(1) that an employer shall inform a fixed-term employee of every suitable vacancy, that is, every vacancy relevant to the qualifications of the fixed-term worker which arises in that employment.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	700	Amendment No. 21 has been ruled out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Revenue.

In page 10, lines 34 and 35, to delete "the provision concerned of".As this Bill does not contain a commencement provision under the Interpretation Act 1937, it commences in its entirety on its passing. This amendment proposes to delete some of the surplus wording from section 12.

In page 10, subsection (1), line 38, to delete "penalise an employee" and substitute "subject an employee to discrimination within the meaning of section 6 of the Employment Equality Act 1998"."Penalise" is a vague and undefined term. The intention of this section might be best implemented if the word "discrimination" were used instead. Discrimination in an employment context has been well defined and is a widely established concept.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	706	I do not propose to accept this amendment. Section 6 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 deals with discrimination on a number of grounds which are not appropriate to this Bill, which deals exclusively with discrimination against fixed-term employees as compared with permanent employees in relation to conditions of employment such as pay, pensions, holidays, etc.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I move amendment No. 26:
In page 10, subsection (1)(c), line 46, after “(b)” to insert the following:(d) by dismissing the employee from his or her employment if the dismissal is wholly or partly for or connected with the purpose of the avoidance of a fixed-term contract being deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration under section 9(3)”.The purpose of this amendment is, in effect, to insert a new subsection 13(d) in order to prohibit the penalisation of a fixed-term employee to include dismissal wholly or partly for the purpose of avoiding the contract of the fixed-term employee being deemed to be one of indefinite duration under section 9(3). The text of section 13(1)(a), (b) and (c) is the same as the text of the Bill passed by the Seanad. By allowing an employee to take a complaint to a rights commissioner, this amendment may prevent an employer from dismissing a fixed-term employee by not renewing his or her contract in order wholly or partly to avoid that employee becoming permanent under the contract of indefinite duration under section 9(3).
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	708	Amendment No. 28 is an alternative to amendment No. 27 and, therefore, the amendments can be discussed together.

In page 11, lines 8 to 10, to delete subsection (3).The purpose of amendment No. 27 is to delete section 13(3) as currently drafted. I am advised that this provision is not necessary but was included originally for the sole purpose of allaying fears that the Unfair Dismissals Acts have been affected in any way. However, a view has been expressed by the ICTU that an impression could be given that the Unfair Dismissals Acts are in some way subject to section 9 and section 13(1). The provision is, therefore, being deleted to prevent any confusion or misapprehension arising. Deputy Howlin's amendment No. 28 appears to have the same objective.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	710	It seems to address the matter better in my view.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	712	I genuinely disagree with the Minister of State on this. The Minister included subsection (3) in the original Bill which states that subject to section 9(1) nothing in this Act shall affect the application of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2001 to fixed-term employees. He wanted to state that explicitly. It caused doubt because the Minister wanted to be explicit that the Unfair Dismissals Acts were in no way subservient to this provision. Such doubt would be dispelled by acceptance of my amendment. Removing the subsection entirely adds nothing to the Bill. However the insertion of the words "For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Act affects the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Acts . . . " would be an addition to the Bill. Members will be aware of the principle of an abundance of caution for the avoidance of doubt.The amendment I propose causes no damage to the Minister's proposal. It is crystal clear and it is something I have been strongly urged to submit by congress. I understand from congress that throughout the consultation process it sought the inclusion of a provision to ensure the protection from unfair dismissal provided for under the Unfair Dismissals Act was in no way compromised by this Bill. At no time did the Department indicate that there was any intention of attempting to make the unfair dismissals legislation subject to the provisions of this Act. I do not believe that was ever the Minister of State's intention. It is clear from the amendment I propose that the Unfair Dismissals Acts apply and are not compromised in any way by these provisions. That is a positive assertion rather than simply deleting a subsection, which the Minister of State acknowledged creates ambiguity. I ask him to provide some jot of comfort to those of us on this side of the House who work on legislation that when we do come up with a proposal, which I believe is objectively better than the Minister's, he might accept it.

It is a laudable amendment and should be accepted.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	716	That is all very fine but it is not needed.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	717	There are many things put into legislation that are not needed. I have given the Minister of State two principles that often apply to legislation: the abundance of caution principle is one. It is just a matter of stating something even if it is understood. The deletion of it might be wrongly construed. I do not see any damage that can be done by the acceptance of the amendment. Some Ministers are more objective in these matters than others but there is a principle that if an amendment comes from the Opposition it is not to be accepted. That is a daft set of attitudes. I think a Minister is all the stronger when he or she does not automatically turn to his or her officials but rather decides that acceptance is the right and objective thing to do.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	718	This was the subject of prolonged discussions with ICTU. It did not like what was there and that is the reason we agreed that deletion of the amendment was the best action.

#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	721	I move amendment No. 30:
In page 11, subsection (1)(a), line 19, to delete “be heard by” and substitute “make submissions to”.This amendment is a suggested improvement. The use of the word "heard" could be construed as being limited to oral submissions. I propose this amendment so as to include written submissions.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	722	I do not propose to accept either of the amendments as I believe they are unnecessary. The phrase, "give the parties an opportunity to be heard by the commissioner", encompasses the making of submissions by the parties to the rights commissioner.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	723	I move amendment No. 31:
In page 11, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following subsection:"(2) Where an employee has completed at least one year of continuous employment with his or her employer or associate employer, a complaint to a rights commissioner under subsection (1) may, in the case of a renewal of a fixed-term contract or where there is a material change in circumstances, include a complaint that the employer's objective grounds justifying the renewal no longer exist or are not objectively justified grounds, and in either case the rights commissioner may require the employer to give the employee concerned a contract of indefinite duration.”.This amendment is to insert an amplified new subsection (2) into section 14. I know the Minister of State has had the opportunity to read the amendment. It adds to the protections afforded to employees and I hope the Minister of State will be willing to accept it.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	724	A rights commissioner has jurisdiction only in respect of a contravention of an obligation set down in the Act. There is no obligation on an employer to justify a renewal at any point after the renewal. There must be objective grounds for renewing at the date of the renewal. I am advised that it would be ultra vires for the rights commissioner to hear or determine such a complaint as it does not refer to any obligation of the employer under the Act. Accordingly, I propose to reject the amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	725	Perhaps we should be more explicit in giving such a right to the rights commissioner. Since the Minister of State believes there is no specific legal provision to give the rights commissioner that right, I will not pursue the amendment.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	726	I move amendment No. 32:
In page 11, subsection (2), lines 38 and 39, to delete "person who, by virtue of the change, becomes entitled to such ownership" and substitute "transferee, within the meaning of S.I. No. 306/1980 European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings Regulations) 1980 (as amended)".Section 14(2) seeks to cover a situation where there is a change of control or transfer of undertakings. This concept has been comprehensively addressed in the context of EC regulations made here in 1980. My amendment proposes the adoption of the meaning of "transferee" as used in that legislation.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	727	I do not propose to accept this amendment. The text as currently drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government which the Deputy proposes to replace is consistent with the language used in employment rights legislation and is more user-friendly than the wording proposed by the Deputy.

In page 11, subsection (3), line 43, after "relates" to insert "or the date of any material change for the grounds for renewal after the renewal to which the complaint relates, as appropriate,".Subsection (3) states that the timeframe for lodging a complaint with the rights commissioner should be clarified to ensure that in a case where the grounds for renewal of a fixed-term contract rather than a contract of indefinite duration are no longer valid, should also be ones that can be addressed by a rights commissioner. That is the import of the amendment.Amendment No. 36 proposes to delete the words "whichever is the earlier". That arises from a submission I received from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions dealing with cases relating to termination of employment. The Minister of State will be aware of the views of ICTU on that matter.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	730	Section 14(3) effectively sets a six-month deadline within which a complaint must be made. This is unduly restrictive. An employee may not be immediately aware that his or her rights are being breached. If he or she does not become aware of the breach within six months, his or her rights of complaint will have been defeated. Other legislation provides for a limitation period which only begins to run from the date of discovery of the contravention. My amendment proposes to introduce this employee-friendly date of discovery concept into the legislation.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	731	Amendment No. 34 is an attempt to purport to give jurisdiction to the rights commissioner regarding a right which is not conferred by the Act. The rights commissioner's jurisdiction is circumscribed by the rights obligations imposed by the Act. An employer is not obliged to justify a renewal after the event. Under section 8(2), he or she is obliged to give a written statement of the objective grounds under section 9(4). There must be objective grounds to avoid an employee being deemed to be permanent under section 9(3).Amendment No. 35 attempts to put a six-month deadline after the discovery of a contravention for bringing a case to the rights commissioners. It would be unreasonable to provide such a timeframe as the discovery of a contravention could, for example, occur two years after it has taken place and in a situation where the fixed-term employee involved may have left the employment.Section 14(3) as drafted, is similar to the other employment rights legislation. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 35, as proposed.With regard to amendment No. 36, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel drafted an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad to include the phrase "whichever is the earlier" in order to deal with the concern of the Department of Finance that pension claims could be made by an ex-fixed-time employee against his or her former employer many years after he or she had left the employment. This amendment would prevent such claims arising and means that section 14(3) of the Bill will be on exactly the same lines as section 16(3) of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill 2001. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	732	I will not argue with the Minister of State regarding amendment No. 34. He is talking again in terms of explicit legal provision not being made for the rights commissioner to take the action that I propose. I have difficulty regarding his rejection of amendment No. 36. The notion that he would act on the advice of the Department of Finance to circumscribe the rights of workers to access pension entitlements on a time basis, causes me some concern, if that is what I heard. Why would the right to a pension, if a pension is accrued, not quite validly be acted upon at whatever time after the cessation of employment?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	733	It would not be appropriate that an employee could make a claim many years after he had left the employment.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	735	For a variety of reasons.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	738	Why? I see no problem in this regard with individuals who have discovered pension entitlement after many years. Why should we circumscribe the rights of someone who has actually worked if they have accrued a pension entitlement? Why should there be any delimitation of their right to claim that pension?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	739	I think the only concern the Deputy has is the fact that it was a concern of the Department of Finance that perhaps caused this to come through.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	742	I move amendment No. 39:
In page 13, subsection (5), line 5, to delete "Minister may, at the request of the Labour Court," and substitute "Labour Court may".In my view it should be the for the Labour Court to decide whether to refer a question to the High Court. This is the position as stated in some other labour legislation, although it is fair to say that most labour legislation follows the model proposed by the Minister in this particular enactment. Nonetheless, as a general principle, the model the Minister proposes in this enactment is wrong. I am not being personal with regard to the present incumbent, but it should not be a matter for the Minister to block a reference to the court if the Labour Court itself wished to make such a reference. It is a matter of principle that should be accepted by the Minister.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the Labour Court rather than the Minister may refer to the High Court a question of law arising from proceedings before it under this section of the Bill. It would be inappropriate from a policy perspective that this should happen without the prior knowledge and consent of the Minister, and could lead to confusion.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	744	Confusion?

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	746	The Minister of State has not given any fair consideration to amendments coming from this side of the House. It is depressing to put an effort into analysing the legislation and seeking counsel and legal advice, when the Minister is not open to any suggestions coming from this side of the House. His pro forma reading of standard responses is unfortunate. Different ministerial styles are applied to different pieces of legislation and it would make this House much more productive if suggestions from this side of the House were engaged with more productively than has happened in this area.There is a simple but important principle at stake, namely whether a referral of a point of law about an issue from the Labour Court directly to the High Court should be capable of being blocked by the Minister. The Minister's only objective response to my assertion that it is wrong in principle is that it might cause confusion. Who might be confused?The bottom line is that the Minister should not be able to block such a reference. If the Labour Court wants to do so, it should have the statutory authority to do it. The Minister is not correct to say that this is the normal standard. I indicated in my first interjection that it is the pattern in most labour legislation but not in all. The model I propose is used in some labour legislation. It is a better, more progressive model, and it takes the Minister out of the loop, which would be a good thing. The Minister should reflect on this, and this would be one amendment which he could usefully accept; it is a principle that does no damage to the Bill and one that would then be a model for future labour legislation. As we improve and consolidate other legislation, we could include this provision as the norm.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	747	I completely reject the criticism the Deputy has made. I studied all those amendments carefully and went through them with my officials. If we had felt that in any case there was a proposal which would constructively add to the Bill, we would certainly have been prepared to consider it. With due respect to the Deputy, many of the proposals made here today would not improve the Bill. Indeed, some of them would be disastrous, and this amendment would certainly be a disaster. The Deputy is proposing that the Labour Court could go to the High Court without reference to the Minister. Surely, one of the things we are trying to do in this House is to prevent many organisations having to go to the Labour Court to improve or change legislation. Is it not normal practice that if the Labour Court has a problem with any aspect of the legislation, it brings it to the attention of the Minister in order that he or she might decide to change it? What would it want to go to the courts for? I do not understand the logic in this proposal any more than I did in some of the other proposals made by Deputy Howlin.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	748	The Minister is being disingenuous.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	752	The Minister is quite wrong, because the model I am proposing is already embodied in law. To say that it would be damaging is nonsense. The subsection proposed by the Minister states that "The Minister may at the request of the Labour Court refer a question of law", not an amendment to the Act, not a matter of legislation, which is the business of legislators, but "a question of law arising in proceedings before it to the High Court for determination by the High Court, and the determination of the court shall be final and conclusive."  That is the section with which we are dealing.I commented on the Minister's lack of engagement with the amendment because when I elaborated on the amendment, the Minister then read out a prepared speech which had no regard for the comment I made. A capable Minister such as Deputy Fahey should be open to amendments from this side of the House on the basis of the arguments made – not simply having read the amendments in advance, but having listened to the case we put as best we can with the very limited resources available to us on this side of the House. A small degree of such acknowledgement would be a more gracious way of dealing with the matter than what we have received.The amendment I am proposing would be advantageous. It would allow the removal of the Minister from the blocking role he envisages in the provision with which he is persisting. That is unfortunate.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	753	It is not a blocking role. There is no evidence to suggest that there is any blocking role, or has been any such role in the relationship between the Labour Court and the Minister. This is a standard provision in employment rights legislation. I have listened to what the Deputy has said. If there were anything in what he said that would merit further consideration, I would certainly be quite happy to give it that consideration. My officials too would be happy to do so, but frankly, this proposal does not make any sense whatsoever.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	754	I move amendment No. 43:

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	764	In his wisdom the Ceann Comhairle ruled out of order amendments Nos. 41 and 42. Amendment No. 41 proposed to include trainee nurses in this legislation and amendment No. 42 proposed to include members of the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána. I would like to hear the justification from the Minister for excluding these three categories of workers, members of the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána and nurses from the provisions of the Bill. We did not get the opportunity to hear that, as the amendments were not in order.By and large I welcome the passage of this legislation, which represents an improvement in labour law and an important advance. It is very belated because the original directive was passed in 1991. It was to have been enacted by 2001 and we may have applied for and received a derogation to 2002. We should have made the legislation retrospective to July 2002 to avoid any ambiguities concerning the legal terms of enforcement and to ensure the State is not open to an action due to the late enforcement of a legal and binding directive.I hope this will now speedily pass through the other House and become law. I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that he is confident there is no risk of legal action or challenge due to our tardiness in getting it on the Statute Book. The Minister should explain why those categories of workers that I have indicated as being excluded, do not come within the compass of the Bill.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	765	I am confident there will not be any legal challenge. While we have had a delay in the enactment of the Bill, which we would have wished to avoid, it is now being passed. It is exceptionally good legislation.In answer to the specific question posed by Deputy Howlin, nurses in training or any form of vocational training or apprenticeship schemes do not form part of the directive. The directive was quite clear in stating that it does not apply to people in training or apprenticeships and this was why they were not included.This Bill was the subject of very considerable negotiation and change since it was introduced in the Seanad. Much discussion took place and I thank my officials for the amount of time and effort put into changing the Bill to accord with concerns that were expressed in the Seanad and by ICTU. It is fair to say we also had some concerns about aspects of the Bill, which involved significant amounts of money. This Bill will cost about €50 million per annum.We looked carefully at the amendments tabled today. I would not want Deputy Howlin to think that in a flippant way we did not consider those amendments. In view of the very comprehensive amount of change, I do not believe many Bills would have changed as much in their most significant aspects as this one has done from the Seanad to the Dáil or vice versa. Consequently I am happy this is excellent legislation.It is complex legislation in that the checks and balances have been inserted to ensure it looks after the rights of workers in the first instance, because that is what it is about, but it also looks after the rights of employers. That was the essence of section 9(4), which the Deputy questioned. Having taken all that into account, this is excellent legislation and the fact that we have not accepted any amendments today has more to do with the fact that we accepted so many amendments from the time the Bill was originally published. As a result it is a much better Bill and I have no doubt that it will not be challenged by anybody.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	766	I welcome this legislation. We are extremely fortunate in getting European directives that force us to introduce such legislation. The Government would not be unduly concerned with rushing through legislation like this if the directives did not need to be implemented and if we were not being threatened with massive fines from the European Union. As other directives are in the pipeline to deal with employment legislation, I urge the Government to be more diligent in future and try to introduce them on time.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	767	As the Bill is considered by virtue of Article 20.2.2º of the Constitution to be a Bill initiated in the Seanad, it will be sent to the Seanad.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	768	I draw the attention of Members to a typographical error in amendment No. 46 in the name of Deputy Deasy. The amendment should refer to page 24 and not page 23.Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 42 and 43 are related. Amendment No. 43 is an alternative to amendment No. 42. As they are related, they will be taken together. Is that agreed? Agreed.

In page 5, line 7, to delete "AND THE EQUAL STATUS ACT 2000".These amendments are to deal with the assault on the Equal Status Act by this Bill and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I propose to strike all references to the Equal Status Act 2000. This Bill is not the place to deal with amending the Equal Status Act. If it is to be amended, it should only happen after a proper consultation and review with its stake holders. At minimum, the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission must be satisfied that any amendment does not undermine the equality rights in this State. In the Bill we have sections 14, 15, 19 and 25 that all impact on the operation of the Equal Status Act and are considered a threat to the equality laws in this State.This is not perceived just by Sinn Féin but by a broad coalition of the following reputable groups: the African Refugee Network, Age Action Ireland, Age and Opportunity in Ireland, Amnesty International, the Community Platform, a network of 27 non-governmental organisations, the Community Workers' Co-operative, the Forum for People with Disabilities, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Integrate Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Council of Civil Liberties, the Irish Traveller Movement, the National Traveller Women's Forum, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the One Parent Exchange Network, Pavee Point, Threshold, Treoir, and The Wheel. I apologise if I inadvertently missed a group.So concerned were those groups that they came together to form the Equality Coalition in an attempt to protect the integrity of the Equal Status Act. For this I congratulate them, but they should also be given the opportunity to be heard before any attempt is made to dismantle the Equal Status Act and its provisions. Despite the broad condemnation and the likely adverse impact of this Bill's proposals on the Equal Status Act, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform continues to fast track this pet Bill of his through the Dáil without proper debate. It is not an acceptable way to make legislation. Anything that potentially undermines the Equal Status Act is of public importance and has implications far beyond the limitations and intentions of this Bill. It sets a precedent that allows an exemption from the obligations of the law for one group and has broad implications for the rest of society as a whole and the direction we are taking as a nation.I consider this another volley fired by the Minister in his self-declared war on a rights-based society. He is proud in his reports to the media that he will not tolerate a rights-based society. He will make sure that no such thing comes to fruition. The groups in the Equality Coalition and I intend to defend the integrity of the equality legislation which was fought for and hard-won. It was won, in principle, in the conclusions of the Good Friday Agreement. We should remember that the Agreement was endorsed by 94% of the people in this State and 86% on this island. The Minister should not under estimate the importance of this social gain to the majority of people on the island and in this State.Section 19 removes the jurisdiction of the Equality Tribunal to hear discrimination claims by licensed premises to the already congested District Courts. I propose to delete the whole of this section. On Second and Committee Stages, I asked why are we giving an extra case load to the congested District Courts. Victims of discrimination by licensees will no longer have user-friendly, affordable access to an independent specialist body. This body was established a few years ago to specifically address such cases of discrimination. Victims will no longer be able to avail of the mediation services provided by the tribunal or its investigative functions. There will not be additional funds for the Equality Authority to take on this extra case load and assist in cases before the District Courts. Forms of representation such as the community advocacy will not be available to applicants before the District Court. People with disabilities are routinely excluded from licensed premises and are the largest potential group of applicants under the Equal Status Act. However, most District Courts are inaccessible, both physically and financially, for those people.In the context of the European Convention on Human Rights and the case of the missing disabilities Bill, we are told that the District Courts are too congested to take on human and equality rights compliance cases. It, therefore, makes no sense to transfer jurisdiction away from the Equality Tribunal in the case of licensed premises.There are other examples of mixed jurisdiction. I referred on Committee Stage to labour law adjudication as an example. If the political will is there, leaving the jurisdiction with the Equality Tribunal can work. It has only been established over a few years and was credited with working well, but we are now undoing it. The proposals in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 have been unanimously condemned by human rights and equality groups, including the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority itself.The proposal was not recommended by the Commission on Liquor Licensing nor by the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol. It will not, in fact, have any effect on curbing over-consumption of alcohol, enhancing public order or enforcement of laws to this effect, which is supposedly the reason underlying the legislation.Exempting an industry or a sector from the jurisdiction of the Equality Tribunal sets a dangerous precedent and opens the door for other areas to demand similar exemptions.Sections 14 and 25 are a licence to discriminate and my amendment proposes their deletion. Section 14 will exclude those under the age of 15 from licensed premises, even if accompanied by parents, if it is after 9 p.m., unless, of course, they are working in the bar. It will make it a criminal offence for a licensee, parent or guardian to allow this to happen.Section 25 amends the Equal Status Act to allow licensee discretion as to whether to allow any person under the age of 18 into the premises. In effect, this is allowing for discrimination on an age ground. The two sections taken together are the equivalent of a blanket ban on children, which will result in discrimination against lawful and responsible families and parents. It will also have a disproportionate impact on women.It will have the additional effect of overturning Equality Tribunal decisions such as that of Maughan v. The Glimmerman. The Minister should consult the list of decisions in the Equality Authority's submission to ensure that he understands exactly what he is doing. Perhaps he does and, as I said earlier, he wants to ensure that we do not have a rights-based society, that he will do everything in his power to undermine it and to dismantle it.Greater enforcement of existing alcohol laws does not require us to implement legislation which will allow for discrimination. Even at this late stage, I ask that the Minister and Ministers of State consult properly with the stakeholders to see exactly what will be the implications of his Department's legislation in regard to them.Will the Minister indicate if he intends accepting any of the 46 amendments before us today? There was an intimation that the Minister would consider changes in Garda identification among other things. I tried to address concerns in this regard in my amendments Nos. 36 and 37.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	772	Once again, I welcome the Minister of State to the House.The series of amendments with which we are dealing goes to the heart of the section of the legislation dealing with equality legislation, the Equality Tribunal and the transfer of jurisdiction in certain matters to the District Court.Reference to the Equal Status Act in the Title of the Bill is an intrusion in the legislation. The grafting on of an element that will undermine equal status legislation should not have been allowed. The Equality Tribunal and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations are removed from examination of discriminatory aspects of admission to licensed premises.This is the European Year of People with Disabilities, yet disabled people are routinely denied access to licensed premises. The various organisations from which we received submissions on this matter expressed concern in regard to this proposal. During Committee Stage discussions it was clear that, while the Minister was intent on taking away the full right of people who might be refused access to a licensed premises, he had no such intention of imposing a duty on licensed premises to ensure that access was provided to those with physical handicaps, particularly those in wheelchairs.Very few licensed premises have ever put in place provisions regarding accessibility. There are very few licensed premises in this city or elsewhere with a ramp. The Minister and his colleagues are quite blithely prepared to allow the situation to be dealt with in this fashion in regard to the refusal of admission, yet no account will be taken of the corollary requirements that licensed premises should be wheelchair accessible at all times. It is not a case of what is sauce for the goose is sauce of the gander. A most disproportionate approach is being taken to this matter.The reference to the Equal Status Act, as proposed by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, should be eliminated from the Title of the legislation and all of the issues that follow should also be dealt with in similar fashion.This matter was also discussed in regard to the Immigration Bill. Considerable concern was expressed by the same organisations regarding the impact of this section, as was stated in respect of the Immigration Bill. The Human Rights Commission expressed its concern, as did the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Pavee Point and the Community Forum. The Equality Authority has roundly condemned this particular provision. Although more consultation is required there is limited opportunity to tease out and improve the section and other aspects of the legislation.The Immigration Bill was signalled for 18 months yet nothing happened until the last minute. This legislation has only been available for the past two weeks. It has only appeared on the scene even though the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been on every chat show the length and breadth of Ireland telling us what a great job he is going to do to deal with the problems of public disorder and the abuse of alcohol.Two weeks before the Dáil goes into recess he hits us with this mixed bag of legislation which, in some cases is unworkable, and in others undermines the hard fought apparatus for protecting, securing and defending the rights of vulnerable sections of our community. It is a shame that the Minister is going down this road.The question of people over the age of 18 being refused access to licensed premises under amendments Nos. 42 or 43 is again a matter that is being dealt with wrongly by this House. Discretion should not be given to licensed holders to determine what age group is allowed on their premises. It is a new form of age discrimination and it should not be permitted under any circumstances. The national Parliament should decide the cut-off point for access to public houses and it should determine that a person is a minor below that age or an adult above that age.The Minister castigated Deputy Deasy for his suggestion that the cut-off point should be 20 or 21, yet he blithely stated that he will now give full discretion to publicans to determine the cut-off point. They can decide that it should be 20, 21, 25, 30 or 65 as long as they make it their policy and give notice of same. That is not the type of permission to give to publicans regarding the citizen's right to access to licensed premises. Such a decision should be taken in the national Parliament. We should be able to tell publicans that a person who has reached the age of 18 or whatever age we decide should be allowed access to their premises. Deputy Deasy might say the age limit should be 21 and someone else might want a different age. I would like it to be 18, which is the age of adulthood in this country. We should legislate for that.

Having put some fine principles into law, established the Equal Status Act and set up the Equality Tribunal, which is just beginning to find its feet and to deal with cases of discrimination, we are moving backwards. Some of the cases being cited, such as Maughan v. The Glimmerman, highlight the legitimate concerns of our citizens. I know John Maughan. He had lost his eyesight and was in a licensed premises with his child. That was legitimate. If we want to uphold the family and keep it together, as we strive to do under our Constitution, why are we pulling it apart by including so many age barriers in relation to the use of licensed premises? We should improve how those licensed premises operate. We have the ability to do that. Given that we are not trying to break up the cartel in the licensed trade, we should lay down strict rules on how it operates. We can regulate for licensed premises to be well operated and to do their business in an orderly fashion. We should pursue that line rather than putting in place significant regulations which have been criticised by the National Youth Council, many tourism bodies and members of the public. If the tourism bodies and the National Youth Council are against it, the Minister should be concerned. We are still concerned about this legislation. The Minister is trying to operate like the old fashioned parish priest with the blackthorn stick. It is anti-family, anti-tourism and anti-fun. The Bill is a step backwards and it should not be passed in its present form. I support the amendments.

I am concerned – I raised this on Committee Stage, although I know the Minister of State was not there – that when gardaí are not in uniform and are combating under age drinking on a particular premises, there may be potential for abuse. A senior Garda officer, such as a superintendent or a chief superintendent, should authorise such an operation. The Minister said he listened to the concerns of other Deputies and that he would take them on board. Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify if those concerns have been addressed.

I want to deal with section 25 to which these amendments directly relate. Before I do that, I want to clear up a few misconceptions. I have not been involved in the debate so far, but it is my information that this matter has been well debated. It is not a question of fast tracking it through the House. We are in the dying days of this session, but my understanding is that the matter has been well ventilated. People have put their views in a fairly robust manner and the Minister has heard many things which will assist him, particularly when he has to codify the law and to revisit all these matters this time next year.The Equal Status Act, the Employment Equality Act and the infrastructure which has been put in place to underpin that legislation have been widely recognised as giving this country one of the most advanced equality systems in the civilised world. I do not accept that any change we make today diminishes, dilutes, downgrades or reduces the protection given by that code to the people. I look forward to dealing with that in more detail on amendment No. 39.Deputy Ó Snodaigh said that it will no longer be possible for the Equality Authority to represent people now that the matter will be dealt with in the District Court. That is wrong. We have specifically written it into the legislation that it will continue to be able to represent them. Deputy Ó Snodaigh also alleged that the reason put forward by the Government for refusing to allow what he calls a rights-based disabilities Bill is that the District Court is congested and there is no point adding more cases to an already congested system. That does not make sense. People with disabilities who decide to go to court will not go to the District Court. They will want to go to courts above the District Court. It has nothing to do with congestion or anything of that nature.Deputy Costello mentioned the disabled and the fact the Minister is taking away their rights. As I understand it, if a person in a wheelchair or otherwise disabled approaches a pub with a view to gaining entry and he or she is refused admission because he or she is disabled, that constitutes discrimination under the Equal Status Act. It will make the publican liable for damages whether the case is brought before the Equality Tribunal, as up to now, or before the District Court. The matter is crystal clear. Deputy Costello said the Minister was taking away the rights of the disabled to get damages or to get vindication in such cases. That is not true. We are moving those cases from the Equality Tribunal to the District Court for good reason, which I will deal with in a later amendment.Deputy Costello also suggested that the Minister in allegedly removing these rights, which he is not, is failing to put a corresponding duty on publicans to make their premises accessible. The difficulty with that is that the Minister does not have any power to put such a duty on publicans. I cite as authority for that no less a body than the Supreme Court which held that such people in the private sector, as opposed to the public sector, can only be compelled by legislation to do something provided it does not involve more than nominal cost.We have scrutinised the Supreme Court's decision and we have pushed the boat out as far as we can in that regard. That will be obvious when we introduce the disabilities Bill later this year.Much reference has been made to the comments of various organisations. I live in the real world and I deal with all those organisations – I have some friends in them. I greatly respect their points of view but I will not follow them slavishly. It is for the Government to govern and it is for organisations to communicate their views. While their views are very interesting and helpful to us in formulating legislation, sometimes we take them on board and sometimes we do not. It is as simple as that. There is no imperative to take account of every single thing these organisations say.

The Deputy's Government did not do that and this Government will not either.These amendments seek to remove or amend section 25, which inserts three new sections in section 15 of the Equal Status Act 2000. The new subsection (3) is in line with recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol. Its aim is to safeguard the licensee's discretion in dealing with the presence of people under 18 in the bar of the licensed premises. I do not believe that the exclusion of under 18s is of itself discriminatory. This is an area in which licensees should be given discretion to deal with each situation on a case-by-case basis. For example, while the licensee might not wish to have children on the premises when a large crowd is present, for example, while a match is shown on TV, he or she might not object to children being present on a day when the premises are less crowded. To require licensees to display a policy setting out every circumstance in which persons under 18 are or are not allowed on the premises would be unduly onerous and inflexible.The new subsection (4) is designed to allow licensees to set a minimum age limit above the statutory minimum set out in the Equal Status Act 2000 as long as the policy is publicly displayed and implemented in a non-discriminatory manner. This would mean, for example, that an off-licence could restrict the sale of alcohol or certain types of alcohol to persons over 21. Of course, Deputy Costello is right: 21 is not the maximum age. One can exclude people up to age 95 if one wishes, although I do not know many publicans who will be doing that.

The Garda will not therefore enforce age limits above 18. Such policies must be implemented in good faith and not become a shield for discriminatory practices. Any person who believes he or she has suffered discrimination and has grounds for believing that a licensee does not operate his or her policy in a fair and non-discriminatory manner may seek redress before the district court.I forgot to deal with Deputy Deasy's point, so I will do so now. It is not intended to deal with the issue of non-uniformed gardaí in the actual legislation but it will be provided for in a disciplinary code. We can communicate with Deputy Deasy about that.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	787	I can understand the purpose of amendment No. 43 in the name of Deputy Costello. If one puts up a notice in one case, why not put it up in another? That has a certain logic to it. However, if one has a policy of not serving alcohol to people below a certain age, as opposed to a policy of not allowing people below a certain age on the premises after a certain time, one's policy is more definite and settled – there is a permanence about it. Otherwise the policy can change from day to day depending on the circumstances.Reading the section, I can see that there are legitimate fears that it could give people the opportunity of discriminating against certain people. However, when a publican is operating his premises he must take account of the Equal Status Act, section 15(2) of which provides that he must operate at all times in good faith. He cannot use the section to say that his policy excludes those under 18 at seven in the evening and then change his mind at half past seven because he prefers the cut of the person who turns up then. The circumstances can be wide and varied in which the publican must decide whether to allow people to enter and I do not think it is reasonable to expect him to put up a notice in all circumstances. With regard to an age restriction on serving, in view of the fact that it is a more definite policy, it is not unreasonable to put up a notice.

They will no longer have user-friendly, affordable access to the independent specialist body established a few years ago specifically for this purpose. They will no longer be able to avail of the mediation services provided by the Equality Tribunal, which have been used quite frequently, nor can they avail of its investigative functions. It looks as though there will be no additional funds for the Equality Authority to take on the extra burden of cases that come before the District Court, which onus this Bill will place upon it.Also, forms of representation such as community advocacy will not be available to applicants before the District Court. A fundamental change is taking place for victims of discrimination. They might not wish to spend a lot of money pursuing their cases or they may not have enough to do so. Despite what the Minister, Deputy McDowell, said about the District Court allowing for people to be represented by the court, everybody wants the best representation possible. That option has been removed from them by this legislation. It is also no longer possible for people to obtain an amicable result.

If one is obliged to have a policy on refusing people over the age of 18 and that policy must be displayed in a prominent position, why should one not be obliged to display one's policy in relation to those under 18? The argument that one is at the discretion of the licensee and the other is more definite does not carry much water. If a policy is to be exercised by the publican, it should be established and available for all to see rather than only being orally communicated. There is no requirement for anything other than oral communication for one type of policy, while for the other type it must be established on a formal basis. The Minister of State seems to agree with this. Rather than our spending too much time on this here, the Minister should take certain amendments back to the Seanad.

Our focus continues to be on investing in infrastructure to bring more serviced land into use and to ensure its effective employment through residential density guidelines. These policies are having an effect because, since 1997, over 287,000 houses have been built nationally. Record levels of housing output are being delivered. The year 2002 was the eighth annual period of record housing output with over 57,000 completions, including significant increases in the Dublin area.We are building houses at the highest level in Europe in relation to population. We will maintain the highest possible level of housing supply with the extension of the successful serviced land initiative, in addition to making more efficient use of housing land through, for example, higher density developments, and making further special development zone designations, as necessary.At their peak in 1998, house prices were spiralling at an annual rate of 40%, but this has moderated significantly. Interim findings from a recent ESRI study on housing and social equity suggest that since 1994, mortgage expenditure relative to total household income has remained more or less stable. That trend is possibly attributable to a combination of rising incomes and falling interest rates, thus counterbalancing house prices. We must await final conclusions on the ESRI study, however.The range of social and affordable housing measures has been greatly expanded and is now better targeted to assist low-income purchasers and those with social housing needs by increasing expenditure and output. Through the range of social and affordable housing schemes, we expect to meet the needs of some 12,000 households in 2003, compared to almost 8,700 households in 2000.The focus of our spending on housing will be in response to the needs of the most vulnerable groups and low-income households, through targeted social and affordable housing programmes.At end 2001, output under the local authority housing construction programme 2000-03 was just over 8,200 housing completions and acquisitions. Local authority housing completions for 2002 will be in excess of 5,000 – the highest level of completions for 16 years.We are continuing to support the development of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, which provided an estimated 1,400 units in 2002 – a record output for the sector. In the past three years, over 5,500 households have benefited under the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes. There has been significant progress in the affordable housing scheme in 2002, with an output of 800 units anticipated, compared to 272 in 2001.Through the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002, we have amended Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which deals with housing supply. Following a review of Part V, as set out in An Agreed Programme for Government, we have removed the rigidity which previously existed in the provision, in order to ensure a more efficient and effective system, thereby delivering a much higher volume of social and affordable housing.We are committed to the reform and development of the private rented sector, enabling it to perform an enhanced role in meeting housing needs in a changing social and economic climate. The core element of policy is the implementation of recommendations in the report by the commission on the private rental sector, including reform legislation.In February 2002, local authorities were directed to carry out an assessment of the need for social housing, which existed on 28 March 2002. The overall results indicate that as of 28 March 2002 a total of 48,413 households were in need of local authority housing, compared to 39,176 in March 1999. This represents an increase of 9,137 households or 23.5%.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	793	Meeting housing demand continues to be one of the major challenges facing the Government. From replies that I have received to parliamentary questions, it is clear that the Government has succeeded in increasing the construction industry's capacity to provide private and local authority houses, over the past eight years. In 1992, local authority completions totalled 1,482 units, while last year there were 5,074 such completions. That represents a significant increase in the number of houses being provided by local authorities. Total house completions in 1993 were 21,391, while last year the figure had almost trebled to 57,695. Even at that rate of provision, however, the lack of house construction means that the cost of housing, particularly for first-time buyers, continues to remain high.The Government has taken on a number of projects in order to reduce housing costs for first-time purchasers. I am pleased that local authorities have effectively withdrawn from providing individual housing loans, a role that has been taken over by the financial institutions. Some 12 years ago, local authorities were providing approximately 40% of housing loans but the figure has now fallen to around 3%. Only in rare circumstances do local authorities, such as my own one, provide loan funding for housing applicants. That is basically because the cost of borrowing is far cheaper through commercial banks and building societies. Local authorities continue to provide serviced land for house builders and purchasers, but the speed at which such land is being made available is not meeting current demand.In recent years, rezoning has not been a popular word but I am pleased that local authorities have grasped the nettle and are continuing to rezone land for residential use. Most councils that have completed their five-year development plans, particularly in urban areas, have identified land that is suitable for residential construction. There is an onus on local authorities to provide land for residential use, as long as the demand is there.At their peak in 1998, house prices were increasing at an annual rate of around 40%. Today, that figure has been significantly reduced, partly because the housing supply is slowly catching up on demand, although it has not yet reached that level. Housing output last year reached 57,000 completions, which means that the rate is growing to meet demand. When that happens, hopefully we will see some stabilisation in the rate of price increase, with perhaps a consequent reduction in the cost of housing at all levels.The introduction of a range of social and affordable housing measures has greatly expanded the ability of individuals to acquire their own homes. Ireland has one of the highest rates of home ownership in Europe and I do not foresee any change in that. I commend the Minister of State and the Government on what they have done to promote housing construction both in the private and local authority sectors.I am concerned about first-time house purchasers, however, because it is becoming ever more difficult for individuals to acquire their own homes, particularly in Dublin. We see people commuting to work in Dublin from as far away as Carlow, Wicklow and Athy. More affordable houses should be built in the larger urban areas, including Dublin.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	794	Housing output is at its highest level ever, which is welcome, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, listed a number of interesting figures during his contribution last night. For example, €1.7 billion will be provided this year in capital funding for housing projects, which compares with investment of €442 million in 1997. Provision for housing, therefore, has increased fourfold. A number of weeks ago the other Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, referred, at the opening of a housing scheme in my constituency, to the high quality housing being provided by local authorities. The schemes are well designed and the houses are well constructed. The schemes also contribute to a new generation of communities.It is also welcome that in recent years local authorities have provided housing schemes in villages and towns that had not witnessed local authority activity for many years. Local authority housing programmes are helping to regenerate many areas that had been depopulated. The decision of the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to provide funding for water and sewerage schemes in many towns and villages has enabled private developers and local authorities to build houses, which, in turn, has eased the pressure on housing in larger urban centres.I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, outlined the substantial funding that has been provided over the past number of years for the disabled person's and essential repairs grant schemes. The expenditure on those schemes in 1996 amounted to €13 million whereas in 2002 expenditure had increased to €84 million. The schemes are worthwhile and their success is causing difficulty for a number of local authorities because of a major increase in demand for them.Both schemes are administered by local authorities and they are of crucial importance as they have enabled the upgrading of many homes The disabled person's grant scheme has made a major positive contribution to the quality of life enjoyed by many elderly and disabled persons. The grant has enabled many disabled persons to continue to enjoy the comfort of their own homes with dignity and self-respect and the maximum attainable independence and it has also saved the State significant expenditure on hospital and residential places. The success of medical advances in extending the life expectancy of people with disabilities and the rehabilitation of accident victims has been a factor in the increasing demand for the grant. These people can return to the community rather than remaining in hospital.Applications for essential repairs grants have increased enormously over the past three or four years and, in a number of local authorities, the number of applications received last year was six times the number received in 1999. Similar to the disabled person's grant scheme, the demand for this scheme has increased significantly because people are living longer and are more likely to be able to live in their own homes. The investment by the State in this scheme represents money well spent in the vast majority of cases, as it has precluded the need for higher expenditure that would have been required if people had to go on housing lists, etc.It is necessary to refocus on the criteria that govern the processing and payment of the grants in order to continue the good work carried out under these schemes. I appeal to the Minister of State and his officials to ensure additional funding is provided to local authorities to speed up the processing and approval of applications under both schemes. They are extremely beneficial, particularly to the elderly and people with disabilities.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	795	The motion has been debated in most households and public houses. Housing is one of the main topics we deal with, as public representatives, whether it is through assisting people with planning permission applications or seeking housing on their behalf. Regardless of which side of the fence we are on, we are all familiar with the problems experienced by people in need of housing.No one denies provision of housing is a serious problem, despite the tremendous success of the economy and the major increase in housing supply over the past number of years. However, charges against the Government that it has not taken action do not stand up. While the price of houses increased dramatically during the late 1990s and in the early years of the new millennium, the rate of increase has slowed significantly this year.A recent study of second-hand residential property in Dublin highlighted that between April and June this year, prices increased by 2.1% compared to 7.1% during the same period last year. That demonstrates how the market has slowed and major increases are a thing of the past. The average price of second-hand property in Dublin increased to €331,863 at the end of June compared to €325,108 at the end of March.The Government has expended considerable time and energy studying the housing problem and getting involved. The Minister for Finance expressed a reluctance to interfere in the market some time ago. However, people asked him to take action, along with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to give first-time buyer's an opportunity. The Government took action and not long afterwards the same people asked the Minister for Finance to take action again to bring back investors. Both investors and private individuals must be involved in the housing market if it is to work properly.However, there are no simple solutions to the housing problem. The Taoiseach has asked the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution to assess the possibility of placing a cap on the value of development land and I hope the committee can make recommendations in this regard in the near future. Local authorities made changes recently to the way they deal with county development plans. The introduction by the Minister of Finance of the provision that 20% of local authority housing schemes must contain social and affordable housing has helped to ease the problem.For too long developers and landowners have made millions at the stroke of a pen and that cannot continue. They must be asked to make a contribution. It is one thing to supply land but necessary infrastructure must also be built. Landowners cannot be allowed to continue to provide land without making any other contribution other than paying capital gains tax. This issue must be tackled. It is every Member's wish that everybody should have an affordable dwelling and that should be our goal.There is a great history of home ownership in Ireland but the significant increase in house prices over the past few years has made it extremely difficult for many young people. This, in turn, has resulted in an increase in the numbers applying for social and affordable housing. For example, earlier in my constituency keys were handed over for more than 50 local authority houses in Sallins. Unfortunately, because of my duties in the House I was unable to attend that happy occasion. The number of non-nationals who were included was interesting as that reflects the change taking place in Ireland. I hope people welcome this change with open arms so that we all embrace diversity, which will benefit us as a nation.I wish to make an appeal to the Minister of State. I am concerned about work permits for people whose accommodation is being provided. I am concerned that there is serious overcrowding and that these people are being abused and over-charged for accommodation. I ask the Minister to have the matter examined.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	796	The Minister pointed out last night that last year was the eighth year in a row when a record number of new houses were built. Some 57,695 housing units were built last year, which represents 14.7 units per 1,000 population, as opposed to the UK construction rate of three units per 1,000 population. It is almost five times the UK rate. People who have looked at the difficulties in the housing market over a long number of years almost all concluded that the key to the resolution of the difficulty is supply. This has been addressed at record levels in over eight years.On affordability, the cost of the house is not the only problem. People who are currently buying houses are enjoying historically low interest rates on their mortgages. This contributes positively to the affordability front. Thankfully, there is also a very high employment rate and a historically low income tax rate, all of which contribute to the affordability of houses.The national development plan states that an additional 500,000 houses will be required in the ten years up to 2010. There is an urgent need for the Government to be prepared to change, as it has been, to ensure we avoid the mid-1980s collapse in house prices, which was devastating and contributed in no small way to the difficulties in recent years. There were considerable improvements in 1988 to the shared ownership scheme. This enabled many people who prior to that could not have aspired to owning their own houses to do so. The impact of Part V, as amended, will be very beneficial from the point of view of first-time buyers. The 1,700 units in the shared ownership scheme last year will be increased each year.There is also considerable success arising from the serviced land initiative but there is ongoing difficulty in relation to the cost of building land. I am pleased that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is looking at the possibility of capping the price of land. The price of land has caused difficulty in housing and equally in national infrastructure projects. It is one area where dramatic progress can be made.In 1999, the Fitzgerald report found that there is a massive shift in household size. This study concentrated on Dublin but the results appear to be reflected nationally. It found that during a period of ten years to 1996, when Dublin's population grew by 4%, the number of households grew by 18%. On the basis of these figures, Dublin would need 150,000 units within ten years. On the basis of more recent studies, the likelihood is that has increased.The McCabe, O'Rourke and Fleming report of 1999 led to guidelines on residential density. In the same year the Government acted by introducing the guidelines, as it did with the Bacon report recommendations on two occasions. The speed with which they were adopted contrasts with the tardiness on previous occasions.The National Economic and Social Council has reported on several occasions on the housing situation. In its 1996 strategy for the 21st century it projected a modest 36,000 units per year for ten years. That had changed dramatically in the Opportunities, Challenges and Capacity for Choice report of 1999. The report stated in relation to new house grants that house purchase grants boost the spending power of buyers. At a time of housing shortages, when buyers are competing against one another for the limited supply of houses, prices are driven up, thereby passing much of the benefit to the vendor rather than the purchaser. Incidentally, quite a few people opposite, including some people who signed the motion, were very strongly of the same view in debates of this nature in previous times.Reports on the housing market by John Blackwell in 1988 and DKM Consultants in 1989, highlighted the falling house prices and the dramatic reduction in the numbers being built. This was in the context of high interest rates and negative equity in some cases. At the time DKM forecast that the depressed market of the 1982-87 period left significant scope for house price inflation, which was correct. Many other difficulties have arisen. There are major bottlenecks in the planning system. Some progress has been made in that regard but not as much as required.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	797	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this matter. It is similar to a debate last week or the previous week. Deputy Timmins of Fine Gael said on 7 February 2002 that if he were the Minister responsible for housing he would abolish the housing grant because it is clear that the grant, which is for first-time buyers, goes straight to builders. On 28 February 2001 he said that his colleague called for the extension of the first-time buyer's grant, which should be abolished. The grant was introduced in 1987 as a boost to the building trade, not house buyers. On 3 February 1999, Deputy Flanagan said that it seemed the first-time buyer's grant and the reduction of stamp duty had merely added to the cost of houses and, through competition, the apparent savings for the average couple pushed up house prices rather than helping to subsidise their cost. An increased supply of houses is the only answer to this problem. They were not the only Members who spoke.Prior to the last election, the Green Party published a housing policy. One of its proposals was that the use of grants and subsidies for people acquiring accommodation should be equal for all types of accommodation and housing users. This would mean, among other things, an evaluation of whether these subsidies are real aids or end up being added to the purchasing prices of houses, giving no real benefit to house buyers, particularly first time buyers of new houses. Everyone is concerned about the housing issue but I am afraid everyone is saying it is everyone else's problem.Prior to the last election, Fine Gael proposed to introduce a bonus scheme for first time buyers. They also proposed to introduce the €1 for €3 deposit plan, whereby the State would give savers €1 for every €3 euro deposited. This is part of the "on the hoof" economics that, unfortunately, the Fine Gael Party has been trumpeting. The Telecom shareholders and taxi drivers were going to be compensated.

The Labour Party – there is no one here from the Labour Party – complained we were building houses but we were not building them in the right places. As usual with the Labour Party, it made no attempt to cost their proposals.Of course, there are issues in relation to housing. One of the few areas tackled sensibly is housing supply. The housing supply can only be addressed by the private sector, working together with new initiatives by local authorities, voluntary housing agencies and housing co-operatives. I will not recite the statistics for the benefit of the House because the Minister did it last night and my colleagues did it earlier. The serviced land initiative was introduced in the Pelletstown area of Dublin, with the help of the Fine Gael Party. Despite opposition from the Green Party, among others, land was rezoned at Pelletstown and 4,000 homes will be built there under the serviced land initiative. As Deputy McGrath will be aware, the Baldoyle fringe is another example of the serviced land initiative which will make a huge difference. We are talking about sustainable development. The Pelletstown scheme is beside the railway.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	808	I am sharing my time with Deputies Morgan, Connolly and Finian McGrath. On behalf of the Green Party I thank Deputy Carey for acknowledging Green Party policy on housing and I will respond to his offer to put forward a number of measures and proposals for a mature debate on this. We can then focus on those in need of housing. In that regard I welcome this Fine Gael motion, which gives us an opportunity to discuss the crisis in housing. We in the Green Party also raised this in our Private Members' time by publishing the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2003.That was a focused attempt to address a serious underlying problem in the price of housing, which is as important as supply and availability. The Fine Gael motion points this out also. For those who did not hear that debate it is important to bear in mind that it is not just a Green Party proposal but is shared by other agencies dealing with poverty, housing and social justice. It aims at ensuring local authorities are given the power to purchase land and that land in their ownership alone shall be zoned for residential housing. We can then remove the temptation and greed that has permeated the planning process as a result of the huge profits made by those who own land, particularly through land speculation.When referring to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, it is important to bear in mind that the Constitution is quite flexible and inclusive when it comes to the rights to private property. Under Article 43 the State:. . . guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property.2. 1º The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.2º The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.If we are talking about being regulated by the principles of social justice, how much social justice does the Government need to be aware of before it takes action without waiting for the All-Party Committee to do something? According to expert legal opinion heard by that committee, the Constitution already contains social justice provisions which allow the Government to take actions such as reducing stamp duty to allow people whose families have grown up to downsize to a smaller house, thus allowing new families to take up residence in traditional suburbs where they have facilities such as schools and shops available. The Government could extend stamp duty exemptions on new properties to second hand houses also and improve tenant rights. There has been some movement in that regard but in European terms we do not have equality for citizens who rent as opposed to those who own property. Renting is therefore seen as something for second class citizens, with people aspiring to become owner-occupiers.We also need to claw back the tax breaks for property investors who are making a huge killing thanks to the Government and its friends, who tend to circulate among such wealthy property investors. Proper insulation is also needed, as the built housing stock is one of our greatest opportunities to save on energy and address our Kyoto obligations. Less energy intensive production, such as that practised in the UK by the Association for Environment Conscious Building, is a real issue.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	809	It may be four years or more before the All-Party Committee on the Constitution reports on the issue of private property, so we should not hold our breath. The Government has stood by for six years as the housing crisis has spiralled out of control. The bombastic Minister and his bumbling sidekick as Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, do not inspire confidence in me. The speech of the Minister of State here last night was genuinely worrying. We can have no hope for a resolution of the crisis if the person with responsibility for the area is all but refusing to accept there is a crisis.Whenever we raise this issue all we hear from the Minister and his Ministers of State is the endless quoting of statistics. Has the Minister no idea of what it is to be affected by the housing crisis? Does he have any idea of what it means to be a young couple living in private rented accommodation? They are haunted by the knowledge that they will never be able to afford their own home and that they are not eligible for social housing. The Government will not ensure security of tenure for them in the private sector and if their landlord does not allow children, when they have a family they will struggle to find a private sector landlord who will accept them as tenants. Does the Minister have any idea what it is like for workers who have to commute from satellite towns? They have been exiled to such towns by the lack of affordable housing in our main cities. The hours spent commuting – probably driving in gridlock – mean leaving early in the morning and getting home late at night, so these commuters never see their children. These are lives of drudgery which have to be borne for the next 30 to 40 years, like the mortgages they will probably never pay off.What about those who in their old age find their ground rent leases have expired and who struggle to hold on to the family home? Imagine the plight of the pensioner faced with a demand from the ground rent landlord for €54,000 for freehold interest plus legal fees of €127 per day until the agreement is reached. That pensioner, who sees the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as someone who spoke out vociferously for the abolition of ground rents in Opposition, faces a lonely battle to save his or her home. He or she sees that the Minister has done nothing to address the scandalous issue of ground rents.There is a lost generation of Irish people whose lives are an endless struggle because the Government refuses to recognise their right to housing, refuses to control land prices, refuses to take on the speculators and refuses to provide adequate levels of social and affordable housing.Is there anything I can say that will make the Minister understand the human tragedy and misery that is caused by his failure to address the housing crisis? The fundamental role of a house and home in a person's life cannot be overstated. A lack of adequate housing and homelessness are inextricably connected to increased levels of mental illness, marginalisation and disenfranchisement. The failure to address this crisis has led to a severe decline in the quality of life of our citizens.Last night the Minister of State told us there was more to housing than price and he went on to tell us it is about affordability. It was clever of him to finally grasp the kernel of the problem – affordability – but he seems not to accept that those on low and medium incomes can no longer afford to buy a house. The rise in house prices continues unabated and the Minister of State's assertions will ring hollow with anyone who takes even a cursory look in the window of their local estate agent only to find there is not a house they can afford. Quite simply, house prices are out of control.The most outrageous statement which emanated from the Minister of State last night was his assertion that the Government has a proud record of achievement in delivering housing across the broad spectrum of housing needs. I dare the Minister of State to repeat this gem of Fianna Fáil propaganda to any citizen who is struggling to buy a house, who is trying to retain their private rented accommodation or, worse still, who is sleeping on the street.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	810	The current housing crisis is unprecedented in our country's history. There is in excess of 52,000 families on local authority waiting lists. That represents a doubling in the number from the 1991 to 2001 figure. What is the Government's strategy to deal with that? The Government has asked us what our strategy is, but I would like to know its strategy. The real nature of development during the so-called "Celtic tiger" economy becomes starkly clear when one considers the paltry number of local authority houses built during the time the Celtic tiger was supposed to have been roaring. Last year 4,403 new homes were built. That represents merely a scratch on the surface. If we hark back to 40 years ago, 25,000 new houses were built per year. In a four year period, 110,000 houses were built. We were literally looking for people to move into these houses. We are a long way behind those figures now.The 52,000 families on the waiting lists represent a massive catalogue of human misery. We hear the graphic stories of overcrowding, illness in children, unemployment, people sleeping in vans and people sleeping on the streets. Poor housing and child illness often go hand in hand. People are more vulnerable to medical conditions such as asthma and they need inhalers as a result of the damp conditions in which they live. Parents also suffer from such illnesses and there is a medical and social cost attaching to that.There is a growing number of people, dual income earners, who simply cannot afford to buy a house. Not so long ago, a good income earner could buy a house. In latter years, double income earners could afford to buy quite a nice house, but now they cannot afford to buy a house or to start a family. Yet opportunistic speculators can afford to buy up to ten houses off the plans. When the houses are ready, they sell them and cream off a massive profit. At times, they cream off between €20,000 to €30,000 simply as a result of putting down a deposit on a house. We must address this issue because it is adding fuel to the price of houses.With the emphasis on balanced regional development in the National Spatial Strategy and in the Government's policy of decentralisation, it is an ideal pretext for the Government to decentralise offices to towns such as Cavan and Monaghan. It would provide a catalyst for future economic regeneration in these areas. Much of this problem, particularly in Dublin, could be solved in this way. Let the National Spatial Strategy kick in and let us start to decentralise. The much heralded National Spatial Strategy, the successor to the Buchanan report of more than 40 years ago, has the potential to complete what Buchanan recommended, namely, the development of major growth centres around Ireland. Such decentralisation would represent a population shift away from Dublin to the regions and it would be a reverse of what happened in the 1960s and 1970s when people flooded into Dublin.It has been estimated that it would take about €3.2 billion to clear the housing list. Even with the massive increase in housing during the years of the tiger economy, local authority housing lists could have been eliminated if a mere 10% of the surplus had been used towards housing. Another cause of the housing crisis is that land is in short supply to local authorities. The adoption of the 1970s Kenny report on building land would go a long way towards bringing down house prices and rents. Kenny's recommendation of a cap on building lands, namely, agricultural land plus 10%, would represent the greatest single factor in controlling the price of building land and, consequently, making it available for house construction at a reasonable cost. Kenny was also in favour of a social housing component in new housing developments. I often wonder how many of today's houses would qualify for a certificate of reasonable value which was a requirement for new houses built in the 1960s and 1970s.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	811	I support this motion because of parts three, four and five which are priority issues on my political agenda. I am talking about the 52,726 families on the waiting lists for local authority housing, while only 4,403 units were completed last year. I am also raising the disgraceful lengthy waiting lists for the disabled person's housing grant and the 5,581 homeless people on the housing lists. Many of us believe this figure is much higher because of the drugs problem and the fact there are more than 14,000 addicts in Ireland. Listening to Deputy Carey earlier, I thought he must have come from a different planet given some of the views he expressed. Whatever about having different political views on issues, cooking the figures to hide the reality is not, and should never be, an option in public life. We need accurate information and figures in order to resolve the issues and come up with solutions. When we look at the three core issues of this motion, it is important not to give up as there are ways to solve these issues.In regard to the housing crisis, yesterday we saw the demand for residential mortgages rise by 24%. Many people cannot even afford to move into that bracket. This is a major national problem and we need radical solutions. We cannot have a situation where 52,726 families are on waiting lists while this Government only builds 4,403 units. If that happened in any other country in Europe, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing would be sacked. Let us not get away from this image of the bin tax Minister, Deputy Cullen solving major national problems. It is all spin with no real substance.The Government must wake up to the reality that there is a major housing crisis and it must build houses. It was done in the past when there were much fewer resources. We urgently need a national housing agency to reduce the bottlenecks in the housing market and planning system. I strongly support the constructive proposal in this motion that the proceeds of lands or lands themselves be used for the construction of social housing. We must target the most vulnerable to give them a leg up into mainstream society. Most Deputies deal with many of these sad cases in their clinics and constituency offices on a daily basis. The Minister is well aware of this sad reality and he must do something about their plight.If we are to ever seriously think about doing something sensible to assist the disadvantaged in our community, housing must be part of that strategy. Families, particularly children, need stability in their lives and the importance of a family home should not be under estimated. Our disastrous housing problem is leading to more poverty and disadvantage, particularly educational disadvantage. The Minister can introduce all the schemes in the world but if families are not housed in proper accommodation, those schemes will not have any impact on educational disadvantage. This is the reality I know well as an ex full-time worker with the Simon Community and as an ex inner city teacher.I commend and thank all the voluntary groups working with and supporting the homeless, including groups like the Simon Community, Focus Ireland, Threshold, Centre Care and Crosscare whose figures yesterday showed the number of homeless using their centres growing by 32%. These organisations are doing a great job against the odds. It is up to us, as legislators, to support them and it is up to the Government to deliver.In relation to the disabled and the lengthy waiting list for housing grants, I demand the publication of the promised review of the disabled person's housing grant scheme and related schemes as we cannot allow a situation to continue on foot of Government cutbacks which is forcing the elderly and disabled people to go without essential services such as downstairs toilets, stair lifts and showers.It is a crime against humanity to allow this situation to develop, and I am now calling for action. We have just come out of the Special Olympics World Summer Games 2003, which has brought a breath of fresh air to this country, and we are gradually moving towards a more inclusive society. However, all of these great activities and the work of the 30,000 volunteers will be hollow if we do not act and do something for all our people with disabilities. I urge everyone to support this motion. This motion has vision, it shows the future and attempts to address the fundamental injustice in our country, and I urge everyone to support it.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	812	I wish to share time with Deputies Crawford, Connaughton and Ring. I only have five minutes so I will try to be constructive as well being as somewhat critical of the Government's performance to date in two key areas that I want to outline.The first relates to staged payments. For quite some time, the charging of staged payments for house buyers has not been a common practice in Dublin, but it is still very much commonplace in a number of regions. In areas like Cork, Limerick, Kerry, Waterford and Sligo, as well as others, builders and developers still charge buyers through the form of staged payments. In many cases, house buyers have paid up to 90% of the cost of a home before taking possession of it. It is an unacceptable situation and the Government, year after year, refuses to take any action to outlaw staged payments to purchase a house.The Law Society has been campaigning on this issue for some time and has gone so far as to send a sample Bill to the Minister and his Department to try to get some movement on this issue. It is awaiting a response. Staged payments benefit nobody except the builder and developer. There was some case for staged payments in the past, when interest rates and when financing the building of a house was a big issue, particularly for small builders. They needed some assistance in financing the building of a house, and to facilitate that they charged the purchaser in staged payments over a period of time. Thus, as they built the house they also got the materials paid for.There is no longer any excuse for allowing builders to charge house buyers by a staged payments route because money is now so cheap. Most developers who are building small or large scale developments can borrow money at almost 2% now from the banks. The argument of needing the house buyer to help finance the physical building of the house and the materials is no longer valid. The fact that a house buyer would need to front up to 90% or even more of the cost of that house is totally unacceptable in modern Ireland. The Government needs to take action but instead it has ignored the problem totally.Buyers now carry the burden in many places for the cost of building. I know this well because it is very much still a practice in Cork. At the same time, they carry the burden for renting accommodation while they are waiting for the house to be finished. This is making a much more complicated situation out of what should be a fairly simple and straightforward process of trying to access a mortgage.What if a builder goes bust half or three quarters of the way through the building of a development? If house buyers had been paying through staged payments, they will have the site of the house, perhaps, on contract but they will have no house completed on it. Yet they may have paid up to 80% of the cost of that house.It is unacceptable for the Government to refuse to budge on this issue. It is possible to introduce amending legislation to outlaw staged payments. We cannot rely on the goodwill of developers and the CIF to voluntarily not indulge in the practice of staged payments, so the Government needs to move on this and I urge it to do so at the first possible opportunity in the autumn.As I only have a minute left, I will make a quick point on the disabled person's and essential repairs grants. In Cork County Council, there are €5 million worth of applications for disabled person's and essential repairs grants awaiting approval. Some €8.2 million has been approved and €2.12 million has been paid so far out of an allocation of €6 million. That is a shortfall of almost €12 million in County Cork for this scheme this year. That is an unacceptable situation.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	813	I congratulate Deputy Allen and my colleagues for bringing forward this very important motion. It is vital that we have discussion such as this because of the crisis in the housing industry. One only has to go out on the streets at night to find people young and old sleeping out on the streets. I know we never saw the Celtic tiger in rural areas to the same extent as in Dublin, but to see so many actually sleeping on the streets is serious.We have a new situation in that we have many more single parents and homes divided through family difficulties, broken marriages and so on. We have to take those things into account. One group I want to mention specifically are single people, whether male or female, who are left outside the family. They find it very difficult to be considered for housing. I have met many males in particular trying in desperation to get the opportunity to be housed because their family homes have been left to their partners. Very often, this is not a result of a cantankerous situation but of a really difficult problem so that they can no longer live together.I had one example where spouses were being asked to sign a document saying they no longer wanted local authority housing if they were to go ahead with their divorce and so on. These are some of the things that are totally unacceptable in this day and age. We treat those who come here from other countries with reason and we have to treat our own with reason as well.The Government talks about all the money available for housing and how much it has increased over the past six years. I just cite the example of one house in my own town of Monaghan. It cost £86,000 to build just seven years ago. A couple of years later it was sold for £140,000. Two years ago it was sold for £260,000. The demand for housing in an area of scarce resources is driving the price of houses up enormously. That is partly because of the problem with sewerage. We had a scheme announced for election purposes that would introduce a special serviced land initiative. That was a couple of years ago and we have still not seen the scheme.There are many sites around Monaghan Town, for instance, waiting to be built on but they cannot be touched because of the lack of services. If we are to treat this problem seriously we have to make sure services are available, regardless of whether the houses are built by the private or public sectors.The other issue on which I want to spend a minute is that of disability and essential repairs grants. These have been tremendous services. I know the Minister argued last night that the expenditure figure had gone up enormously, but again it has gone up because of pricing structures. It is hard to get builders to get involved in some of these smaller schemes but they belong to those who are worst off. They are being brought forward for the elderly or the disabled. People cannot get an essential repairs grant unless they are disabled or over a certain age, and we need to ensure that funds are available for those types of grants. The local authority in County Monaghan still has some funds in that area because its members spent long nights discussing this issue before deciding on its budget.I have seen letters sent to constituents in the other part of my constituency in Cavan on a continual basis indicating that their applications are being put on hold or have been refused. I read one letter which indicated that a grant has been approved but could not be drawn down until funds become available. That grant was sought for a 95 year old who desperately needs a downstairs toilet and facilities. I advise the Minister of State that we can all talk about figures.I had a discussion with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, the other day regarding the once off housing issue in rural areas. I urge the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to work together to ensure that proper guidelines are drawn up to properly maintain rural areas. There is no point in having the CLÁR programme unless people can build houses, not in a haphazard but in a structured way in rural areas.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	814	I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Allen, on introducing this motion. Of the 52,000 families who do not have a house, 1,100 live in County Galway and 1,300 live in Galway Corporation area, making up almost 2,500 families in Galway. In the Galway County Council area we managed to house 150 families last year. At that rate, people who are seeking a house this year will get a house in 2011.I want to address the question of the Government side-stepping this issue. It has all but withdrawn another large subsidy from the housing market. We all know what it did in regard to the first-time buyer's grant, but it has now withdrawn almost everywhere in the country the subsidy for affordable housing. I was delighted and intrigued to hear Deputy Carey say earlier that there was a fine housing project somewhere in County Dublin where affordable houses were sold for €133,000 per house. According to a reply to a parliamentary question I received an hour ago, I learned that because houses in a housing project in Portumna cost €125,000 each the authority could not give a subsidy and, in regard to a housing project in Knocknacarrra, the authority thought that people would be able to buy the houses without a subsidy. Am I to take it that the subsidy for affordable housing is only available to people purchasing such houses in Dublin city, given that people cannot get the subsidy in Galway city or county? We know that the subsidy was as high as €25,000. Why is it that people down the country on low incomes are not entitled to a bite of the cherry?The senior Minister told us for years that affordable housing was an important vehicle to allow people on low incomes to own their own homes. Why can people in Dublin get this subsidy when people in County Galway cannot? Another part of the reply to the parliamentary question to which I referred indicated that the maximum amount of a loan given by a local authority is €130,000 and that, as an applicant can get that amount of a loan, this subsidy will not be granted.I will remind the Minister of State of the people who can get a loan for €130,000, which is what is important. The rate of interest on a loan given by the local authority in County Galway is 4.12%. On a loan of €130,000 over 25 years, a couple would have to pay back €719 per month. If such a couple were granted the subsidy, which would reduce their loan to nearly €100,000, they would have to pay only €553 per month. The difference between the two repayments is €166 per month, which works out at a little more than €40 per week. That is more than what people pay in rent for a county council house. Once-off local authority houses built in County Galway cost approximately €100,000. That involves a direct payment by the State. Why will the Minister not give people who purchase such houses the subsidy which is granted to people who purchase similar houses in Dublin? The Minister should grant the subsidy to people in the country to allow them to own their own house. Such housing involves no maintenance costs or messing around with payments for the State. If ever there was an opening to allow families to own their own houses, this is it.Why does the senior Minister not come out openly and say that this particular subsidy is all but withdrawn from everywhere except Dublin? I would not have known the lower figure for such housing if Deputy Carey, for whom I have great time, had not informed Members earlier that such houses were sold for €133,000. I hope it is not case that people who live outside Dublin city are being penalised in this area on top of everything else.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	815	I compliment my colleague, Deputy Allen, on introducing this motion. I have no doubt that when he is Minister with responsibility for the environment he will deal with this problem in a serious manner. We would have no shortage of houses if spin could build. I listened for years to spin from the Government spin doctors telling the people how many houses the Government would build on a yearly basis and lists were issued every week. I thought we would never see a shortage of houses again, but it was all spin. The only people to whom the Government talks and listens are the builders and, by God, they have a hold of Fianna Fáil and the Government. Vested interests are involved in housing. Builders are buying land in every part of the country, even in areas not zoned for development in order that they will have total control over the land into the future. They will decide what housing will be built, at what price it will be sold and who can buy it.There are other vested interests who are also builders. They are friends of Fianna Fáil. They build flats and houses and rent them out to Joe Soap and the taxpayer has to pay €300 million for such accommodation. That is what the health boards pay every year in rent subsidy, but the big builders get that money because they control the property.The time has come for local authorities to be given the necessary powers and resources to buy land and compete with the big builders. They could allow the big builders to buy land, but could ensure that planning permission would not be granted unless they could get the field beside the proposed development to build local authority housing. Drastic action must be taken on housing. The builders have become more powerful and they are on the inside track with the Government. They can call to the tents on racing day in Galway and determine housing policy. That must stop. We must put the necessary resources into housing and give the county managers and councils adequate powers.Saddam Hussein was decommissioned in Iraq a few weeks ago, but we have a bigger dictatorship on the opposite side of the House, which is taking away the powers of the elected members to local authorities. They are taking elected members out of local authorities. It is a case of giving power to everybody but the elected members.The greatest scandal of all is the matter of the disabled person's grant. A woman from Lahardaun called to my clinic seeking a disabled person's grant for her mother who was at home. That woman was told by the local authority that the money was gone for this year. I checked the position with the local authority and was told that it could be 18 months before that this woman's application is dealt with. Is that not a disgrace at a time when we have so much money and the Government intends to spend €500 million on Government jets next year? It could find the money for the Government jets, but why can this woman not be given a disabled person's grant? Why did her daughter have to come into my clinic from Lahardaun and cry in front of me because she is depending on a portion of a disabled person's grant? The first-time buyer's grant was removed. The health boards cannot deal with the special housing aid for the elderly because they do not have the necessary resources or support from the State. The time has come when we must make a commitment to people in need of housing, to those who need the disabled person's grant and to the elderly.This evening was a beautiful evening. I walked up the street a short time ago and I saw an elderly gentleman lying in a doorway. Is that the sign of a civilised society? It is not. If there were proper homes and care that would not happen in this country. The Minister and his officials need only walk outside Dáil Éireann and they will see that person.The spinners in the Department should stop their spinning and put the money into the disabled person's grant and into housing. The people of this country should be housed and the builders who have total control of the land, the Department and the Government, should be wiped out.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	816	This Government has a coherent and credible housing strategy which is designed to increase housing supply, to improve access to housing for lower income groups and to improve the housing conditions of local authority tenants and other key groups such as the elderly, homeless persons and the disabled. Nothing that has emanated from the other side of the House has discredited this fact. I will deal with the ERGs and DPGs in due course. By bringing forward this motion, it seems that Fine Gael want the Government to reverse its policies which have yielded record levels of housing output.We are all aware of the pressures in the housing market. Recent population and economic growth and particularly changing household formation patterns have seen household size rapidly converge towards EU norms. This Government's consistent overall approach to the housing issue has led to record levels of housing output. Since 1997 over 280,000 new houses have been built. Some 57,695 houses were built in 2002, the eighth consecutive record year of housing output. Indications suggest that this figure can again be surpassed in 2003. We are building at the fastest rate in Europe per head of population. We need to continue to do so to ensure that our young population can aspire to home ownership or seek rented accommodation whether in the private or social housing sector. Increasing supply is and must remain the main objective of the Government's housing strategy. It was suggested that only 4,400 local authority houses were built last year. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, indicated that output from various social housing measures met the needs of over 12,700 households on the waiting list.Given the collective amnesia of the Fine Gael Party, which always seems to set in when it brings forward a motion on housing, it will be difficult for it to remember that it was never easy to buy one's first house. However, due to our efforts in increasing housing supply, a greater number of people than ever before are realising their dream of buying their first home. My colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, stressed last night that the affordability of the housing provided is key. Factors such as increases in disposable incomes, low mortgage interest rates and favourable taxation rates are in sharp contrast with the rates that applied when Fine Gael was in power.

Has he or the Fine Gael Party given any thought to what such an agency would involve? All social housing programmes are essentially local and local authorities are best placed to assess local needs and to determine the scope of house-building programmes. The idea of having a national housing authority controlling and deciding where houses would be built in every part of the country is of very questionable wisdom.There is no basis for Deputy Gilmore's claim that because the Bill would not be enacted until the autumn, landowners would have an additional opportunity to evict tenants and increase rents. More seriously, however, there is a danger that this sort of misinformation could create irrational fears on the part of both landlords and tenants. The fact that someone like Deputy Gilmore got this matter so wrong underlines the need to give people a good opportunity to study and understand this legislation.The Bill proposes to update the legislative framework for the private rented sector, providing added protection for tenants, particularly in terms of rent reviews and security of tenure. There has been much debate about ERGs and DPGs. The Deputies opposite will remember that in 1994 when they were in Government, the total allocation for DPGs was £31 million

In 2002, there was a record level of €56 million allocated. In 1995, Donegal received £387,000 as against €6 million this year, a fact I wish to bring to the notice of my colleague, Deputy McGinley, who is not present. We have a proud record. We are delivering on housing. Nothing that the Opposition has said in the debate has taken any of the gloss off our achievements. I am happy to commend the amendment to the House.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	828	I wish to thank my colleague, Deputy Allen, for putting down this Private Members' motion. Deputy Carey has left the Chamber. He complained about there being no Opposition Members in the Chamber even though they outnumbered those on the Government side. He left immediately after his contribution and did not even wait for the next speaker. I wish to remind him of what were the Government's priorities in housing since he cited figures from former Members of this House. The Government's priorities were to increase first-time buyer's grants to €6,550 for a couple, to accelerate the supply of new houses and to control the rise in house prices. There were about ten points which have all fallen by the wayside since this Government came to office. It is quite easy to cite figures from the past. We must now deal with the reality of the present.The Government has failed in other areas and its failure in the area of housing has been spectacular. There are almost 53,000 people on housing waiting lists. The Members on the other side of the House praised the building of 4,500 local authority houses last year. It would take 12 years to clear the current waiting lists if nobody else went on it in the next 12 years. That is the reality of where the Government has taken the people. There should not be any more of this "We did this", "We did that" or "We put more money into housing", because it does not stand up.The rocketing cost of new houses means that it is now impossible for any young couple to purchase a house. In 1998, 45% of houses cost less than £120,000. Today only 1% of houses being built cost less than €120,000. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, imposed another severe penalty on first-time buyers when he abolished the first-time buyer's grant. Despite the fact that the Government said it increased it to €6,500, he abolished it with one stroke of the pen, without warning anybody before the election. We never heard of this before the election. That alone cost first-time buyers about €3,800, almost €4,000. The 1% increase in VAT which he introduced the day or the week after the budget, put another €2,000 on to the average cost of a house. This Government has done nothing to control the spiralling cost of insurance and builders' insurance has put another €2,000 or €3,000 on to the price of a house. The price of a house is beyond the reach of the ordinary couple trying to buy a house. We in the Opposition are not responsible for that; the Government and the Ministers concerned must take responsibility.The most vulnerable section of our community is being treated shamefully. I do not want the Minister telling me how much money has been allocated because that will not wash anymore. Most of the money allocated was for last year's grants. Those grants were sanctioned before the election when everything could be sanctioned because the Government wanted to give the impression that the last five years were going to continue forever.Before the election it was spend, spend, spend, and since the election it is cut, cut, cut. It is unreal to be talking about that. Some local authorities are being honest about this and telling the people. Deputy McGinley articulated this point very well last night. I noticed the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, in the Public Gallery at the time when Deputy McGinley was articulating the situation in the Minister of State's own county of Donegal, where 600 letters went out to people telling them not to go ahead with work already approved, because there was no money for it. Even those who had the work done, as a lot of people did, could not be paid. That is in the Minister of State's own county, Donegal. He did not refer to that.

In other local authority areas they are not telling the people. They pretend they are dealing with the applications. They are stalling them in every way. They take longer to estimate the costs and to examine applications. In some local authorities they are now looking for a higher percentage of the cost, and paying only 75% of the costs. When people eventually get grant approval, they find they are not able to raise the 25%, or whatever percentage between 10% and 25% is being asked.How can a disabled person on a disabled person's pension, on social welfare, afford this? If repairs, for example, were to cost €24,000, how can a disabled person afford €6,000? The application simply dies and the Government does not have to pay out any money. That is what is being achieved.In other local authority areas, priorities are being established. There is priority one and priority two. Very few people are put on priority one. Their cases might be looked at sometime. Others, on whose behalf Deputy Connaughton, for example, might inquire, are told they are on priority two, and priority two cases will never be looked after. That is the reality. People are being deceived, but will not be deceived any longer. The Minister of State might as well come clean and tell the people what the situation is.Moreover, when money is provided to local authorities, they have to put up one third of the grant allowance. That is crippling some cash-starved local authorities. They are not able to raise the money, so they have to stall the grants until the money comes in the following year. Nobody is being fooled. Both the disabled person's grant and the essential repairs grant have disappeared, and we may as well tell the people.What of the disabled person in a sitting room downstairs, unable to climb the stairs any longer? There is the embarrassment of having to use makeshift toilet facilities downstairs. What does the Government do about that? Nothing. That is the reality.Deputy Connaughton referred to affordable housing. I will refer to the oldest local authority housing estate in Galway, Finbar's Terrace in Bohermore, very near my own office. Before the general election, it was announced three times that there would be a big refurbishment job done on the terrace – new roofs, windows, ranges, central heating and pebble-dashing. Since the election the city council has been asked on five occasions by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to cut down the estimates. All the terrace is now getting is the replacement of its old rotten windows by other wooden windows. They are not even getting aluminium windows. That is the reality.The people were codded right up to the election, but they will not be codded at the next local election, because people are waiting in the long grass for this Government. No matter what the Minister of State says, or what fluff we hear from the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, the people will take it out on the Government parties at the local elections, and I am looking forward to that campaign.

I would have thought in the very first instance that the Ministers would have come into the House and thrown themselves on its mercy, and beg for forgiveness from the people of Ireland for the dirty tricks perpetrated on them for the last six years. It is truly an appalling situation. Never in my time in public life, nor the time of anyone else in this House, has there been so much disappointment for so many people. The Minister of State and his Government failed the new generation because they failed to keep house prices down so that that generation could buy houses. They failed their parents, because the parents, having paid their own mortgages, are now being encouraged to assist their families, who otherwise will not have a home at all.The Government has also failed those on council housing waiting lists, because they have been kept on waiting lists for the last seven years. There was a local authority housing allocation the other day. There were people on that list for eight years, and some of their children were ten, 12 and 14 years of age before the family got a house. This is the caring and the compassion that we get from the Government sitting opposite, and we listen to them.The Government let down people with disabilities. It failed again. People with disabilities were let down in a year in which the focus of such people was proudly on this country, with Ministers sashaying around Croke Park and aircraft overhead congratulating them. My colleagues have already illustrated clearly how they are being let down. How can the Government have the neck to behave like that and to treat people in that way, people who are already in a sufficiently difficult situation, rubbing their noses in it and letting them know that it does not care for them? The Government is a disgrace.The Government failed on affordable housing, as my colleagues have pointed out. It failed because it did not want affordable housing. It did not want those who qualified for affordable houses to get them, because they might get on in life. It did not suit the new agenda, which is to take away from people the right to own homes of their own, and to hand it over to landlords. There have not been as many landlords in this country since the time of Oliver Cromwell. Never has there been such an increase in their numbers. Every house that comes on the market in my area currently is bought by an investor or a financial institution or someone else, but not by someone buying a house for himself or herself. Such houses are bought as investments.The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, had the audacity the other evening to tell me that the way to do it was to get five, seven or eight people to come together and share a house. What is the end result of that? The rent works out at €100 per week per person. That is the rate in my area. Ten people can be put in a house, and the rent is €1,000 per week. To whom does it go? It goes to the landlord, the financial institution, the bank or whoever owns that house. I cannot understand how Ministers sitting on the Government side of the House have the audacity to make a suggestion to the effect that we should go along with that. That was never part and parcel of what we had in this country. I have often said before that in banana republics they would deal with such situations, and it would involve more than a sacking.I do not know where the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, or his Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, are tonight. I presume they are cowering in some corner. They are certainly not going to Croke Park to claim responsibility for all the assistance and good work for which they have been responsible over the last couple of years.The Government also failed to support those who tried to live in rural areas. It let them down completely, because it took on board An Taisce, which has ensured that nobody who has lived in rural Ireland for all of his or her life will get planning permission in rural Ireland. The Government gives An Taisce a grant, a subsidy to assist it in its work, to ensure that it gets every opportunity to object, and put those looking for planning permission out of business. They are told to go and buy a house in a settlement. The fact that they cannot afford to buy houses in settlements does not come into the reckoning at all, because that would not be part and parcel of the Government's thinking either.The Minister of State can think very carefully, and his Department colleagues can do the same, but the Government has failed. I have mentioned five failures, and my colleagues have mentioned many more. The Government failed the homeless – those sleeping in doorways in Dublin. The latest excuse I heard for this was that there were not really that many people homeless, it was just that the counting was more accurate lately. The idea was that had they not been counted so well, there would not be so many homeless people on the homeless list.I have heard many excuses in the past, but I have never heard an excuse like that. This has been a practice of the Government in the recent past. Whenever the numbers rise on local authority housing lists, and become unmanageable and intolerable, the Government counts them again. It shifts as many people as it can off the lists, and then announces the figure has been reduced by ten or 15 or whatever, and promises a survey or a report.I am saddened and I would be truly embarrassed if I were sitting in the seat occupied by the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, because the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing are elsewhere, hiding and skulking in their offices, afraid to come down to listen to the true story of their efforts over the past six years.Before they all retire to the rarefied atmosphere of the tent in Ballybrit, members of the Government should think about those with special needs who cannot get the disabled person's grant for the variety of reasons my colleagues have indicated. They should think about the people sleeping in the doorways of this city and other towns and villages throughout the country. They should think about this while they drink their martinis and eat whatever repasts they will have. They should think about the people who have been let down by the previous Administration and this one.They should ask themselves a simple question. Will many of the homeless, those with disabilities, those who cannot afford a house or those with no chance of getting a local authority house frequent the rarefied atmosphere in that tent? I do not think so. However, those people will get an opportunity at some stage and I hope we are all here to see it. The Government has failed. It has let the country down, let the people down and, worst of all, let itself down. Members of the Government should be ashamed.

A number of Deputies on Second Stage raised a concern about potential abuse in this area. They felt that a superintendent, at the least, or a chief superintendent should authorise the targeting of those premises where under age drinking was occurring by this means. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, said it would be dealt with under the disciplinary code rather than within the terms of the legislation. Will the Minister explain what that means and how it is going to work?

Such a scenario is best addressed in the context of the Garda code. Generally speaking, gardaí who are on plain clothes duty should not be in pubs. On the other hand, they might be keeping a subversive under surveillance and they might have to sit there with a pint in their hand to do so. It is a matter for internal Garda discipline to distinguish between legitimate cases for them being on licensed premises or otherwise.Generally speaking, I would like to think that a garda, while on duty, would not be on licensed premises, unless it is for an official purpose. They should not be there and the only way to ensure that is being observed would be to make a requirement in the regulations. If it was provided for in statute, a court would require proof before one could operate on the basis of the evidence of a garda, which would be inconvenient.If one puts the issue of gardaí on plain clothes duty being on licensed premises into the Garda disciplinary regime as part of the Garda code, then I think one is making a practical provision to prevent abuses. If abuses did come to light and if it were to emerge that a garda was in breach of the Garda code in respect of his or her presence in a premises—

In page 7, line 29, to delete "subsection (1)(c)” and substitute “subsection (1)(b),
(c) or (d)”.Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 refer to conduct which has occurred on the licensed premises in three specific areas. Section 4(1)(b) refers to permitting a drunken person to consume intoxicating liquor,(c) refers to permitting drunkenness to take place in the bar and (d) refers to admitting any drunken person to the bar. As regards (c), the publican can use the defence that he or she took reasonable steps to prevent the drunkenness taking place. I do not understand why the same defence cannot be used in the other cases, that is, permitting a drunken person to consume intoxicating liquor and admitting any drunken person to the bar. Amendment No. 5 seeks to delete “drunkenness concerned taking place” at the end of subsection (4), which states that “the licensee took reasonable steps to prevent the drunkenness concerned taking place”, and to substitute “the conduct complained of”. That would refer to the defensive reason for the steps being taken to prevent the occurrence being extended to the three areas in which an offence can happen.

Unfortunately, the definition of "bar" included in the Bill, even after these utterances by the Minister, still includes many more activities in a hotel premises than the Minister intended. The definition of "bar" in the Bill is:Any open bar or any part of licensed premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor and shall include any counter or barrier across which drink is or can be served to the public.This extends the definition of the bar area to function rooms which have a bar counter, the food service counter in restaurants, even counters at receptions, cloakrooms or, as we all know, porters' desks. This is clearly an absurdity and an Act that contains such a provision does not make sense to those of us who are involved in the hotel business. A case could be brought to court by a garda who claimed that a 20 year old person without documentary evidence of age was in the reception area of a hotel after 9 p.m. and this could result in the judges fining the licensee up to €1,500 and enforcing a closure order on the premises. This is a major difficulty to be faced by many hotel owners in the future. Under the strict interpretation of the definition of "bar", it will also be an offence to allow children, even when accompanied by their parents, to sit in the reception area of a hotel after 9 p.m.I put it to the Minister that the real meaning of "bar" is the part of the premises which is mainly or exclusively used for the sale of intoxicating liquor to members of the public and which should be known as the public bar. Many premises and other establishments which hold functions have a public bar. However, they also have one or, in most cases, two function room bars. That is where we supply liquor for weddings, functions, dinner dances and so on. In the main, a reasonably run, decent hotel with 50 bedrooms employs 40 people or more. They are small industries in rural areas which are of enormous importance and are sometimes the centre of the community. Anything that damages the livelihood of these establishments should not be encouraged. I know it is not the Minister's intention to do this in the Bill.I ask the Minister to give us clarification and put at ease the minds of those in the trade who are maintaining very high standards, supplying a great service and fulfilling a need. These people have invested millions and are doing their utmost to live within the law, but the current definition of the word "bar" means they could find themselves in an impossible position.

The bar does arise in the context of Deputy Costello's amendment. The definition of a bar is "any open bar or any part of licensed premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor."  It goes on to include "any counter or barrier across which drink is or can be served to the public". The definition is a space used for the service of liquor and also the physical thing people describe as a bar, namely a counter. I ask the Deputies and also members of the Irish Hotels Federation to note that the offence created by section 34, which is inserted by section 14 of this Bill, is that the holder of a licensed premises "shall not, subject to subsections (2) to (4) of this section, allow a person under the age of 18 to be in the bar of a licensed premises at any time."  One cannot be in a counter because one cannot be in a piece of furniture. The only place in which one can be is the space defined in the first part of the definition. I want to make it clear that one cannot be in the reception desk or a shelf or the porter's desk or anything of this kind.

This suggestion has been put to me very forcibly, not least earlier on in this evening's proceedings during the last division. But if one allows children between the age of ten and 18 to be in the bar of a hotel or a pub on the basis that they are coming home from a match or on the basis that some food is on offer to them, the natural implication is that Café en Seine in Dawson Street can allow children in on the same basis. Any suggestions being made about this law being impractical or any suggested amendments must take into account every pub in Ireland. If it applies in the pub in Gweedore in which this happy bucolic scene is taking place, with kids coming in to have a Club Orange on the way back from the local GAA match, it must be the same in Dawson Street and in the superpubs of Dublin. Either we are serious about allowing children into those premises or we are serious about not allowing them. There is not really room for manoeuvre on that issue.I have heard hard luck stories – it is 10 p.m. on a summer's evening, what harm for the children to have a Club Orange on the way back from the GAA match? That may sound very plausible, but how do I frame a law that accommodates that story yet makes it an offence for a 17 year old to sit all night in a super-pub 100 yards from this House? There is no way of distinguishing between both cases so I would ask Deputies to take that into consideration.To make it clear that children can attend weddings, 21st birthday parties, school reunions and the like, the prohibition on persons under 18 being in the bar of a licensed premises is tempered by the provisions of section 14(4) which states:It shall not be unlawful for such a holder [that is the holder of a licence] to allow a child who is accompanied by his of her parent or guardian or a person who is at least 15 years but under the age of 18 years to be in the bar on the occasion of a private function [which means the public are not entitled to go in at the same time] at which a substantial meal is served to persons attending the function.That is as good as I can do to distinguish between events such as 21st birthday parties and the rest. I am grateful to Deputies who have pointed out all these things. I am also grateful to Deputy Cassidy who must remember that it is an offence to be in a bar; the offence cannot be committed by reference to a piece of furniture only, one has to be in a place that a court would hold was a bar. I have done everything that can reasonably be done to distinguish between those kinds of social occasions at which it is reasonable for people under 18 to attend – notwithstanding the fact that there is what we would call a bar in the corner of the ballroom or other premises. Alternatively, this legislation would even permit the bar of a premises to be closed for the evening and made available to a family or club, provided it was a private event at which a substantial meal was served. That is as far as the House can go in dividing up the various scenarios that have been outlined by Members of both Houses as the Bill went through. It is as good as we can do.I fully accept that Deputies who have expressed doubts about the legislation would like to have a rule that would somehow accommodate children going into rural bars on summer nights to have a Club Orange on the way home from a GAA match, but I cannot do that, while at the same time saying the same thing cannot happen in a superpub in Dublin. If somebody can work out some formula whereby I can distinguish between the two, I would be only too happy to do it. I would stress, however, that since the Bill is only intended to span the 2003 to 2004 period – and there will be an opportunity next year to revisit the whole issue – my ingenuity, and that of my officials, has been exhausted by what we see before us.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	856	As regards Deputy Costello's amendment, I want publicans to be serious about drunkenness on their premises. I do not want them to say they had a standing instruction to their staff that drunks were not to be allowed in, or that people who were drunk were not to be served. That is the kind of cop-out that would avail the owner of a superpub where people had been found stocious. I am not interested in instructions to bar staff, I am only interested in pub owners knowing that they face closure if people are found drunk on their premises. If they understand that closure will follow, as night follows day, the culture will change. If bar staff allow drunkenness to occur, the owner or manager will say, "What in the name of God are you doing? The place will be closed if somebody comes in and sees this scene."  They will be out of business for a week for a first offence and that is how we can engender a different culture as regards serving alcohol.Deputy Costello is trying to soften the effect of the provision but if we allow people to prove that they had some standing instruction or did their best in all the circumstances, we will hand to the very well legally represented owners of superpubs a way out of the obligation that I am trying to put in place. If somebody is drunk on the licensed premises, save with the exception of paragraph (c), the onus is on the owner to explain to a District Court that it is not a crime.I am not some kind of moral puritan or whirling dervish trying to clean up Ireland but I am convinced that when this Bill is enacted, publicans – and especially those relying on lounge staff to keep the drink going out in great volumes in superpubs – will suddenly realise that there is another side to the coin, namely, if people become drunk on the premises, they will cause the pub to be closed. That will bring about a sea change in the attitudes of publicans and hoteliers to what happens on their licensed premises.As a footnote, I accept that the great majority of hoteliers and publicans would be very worried if they thought for a moment that drunkenness was taking place on their premises. That is not the case everywhere, however, otherwise we would not have the scenes we are witnessing outside some such premises at closing time. I want to bring about a culture change and the law as proposed will have that effect. I do not want to provide more lifebelts for people who get into trouble, as well as more hooks upon which lawyers can hang their wigs to protect people on whose premises drunkenness has occurred.

I am merely trying to ensure that due process continues with regard to such offences. If the Minister is specifically ruling out any reasonable steps as a defence for these matters, does he envisage that there can be any defence in any of the circumstances outlined in sections 4(1)(b), (c) or (d)? Section 4(1)(d) makes it an offence to, “admit any drunken person to the bar”, and there is no defence against that. Does that mean that every little pub throughout the length and breadth of Ireland will have to have a bouncer on the door—

There is no defence for the publican because he cannot say he took reasonable steps to ensure that a drunken person was not admitted to the bar. The Minister is saying that if a drunken person is on the premises, the publican is for the high jump straight away. Under the terms of the legislation, he will be penalised by a fine but how will this work? We want the legislation to be workable but we do not want it to be presented in such a fashion that it will be unworkable. The Minister has just said that the legislation must work in the same way for the Café en Seine in Dublin as for a premises down in Belmullet in County Mayo. The Minister should clarify why he is presenting the case in this particular fashion, which to my mind will make the law quite unworkable in some public houses.

The Minister indicated he would seriously consider reasonable amendments. I hope, when the codification of the licensing laws is introduced in a year's time, more Members will participate on Committee Stage to put the stamp of the Dáil on it with the agreement of the Minister.Deputy Costello is saying there is no defence for a licensee if a drunken person is admitted to a bar. However, the word "admit" means one would give a licence to an individual to enter the premises whereas if he or she were able to sneak in, that would be a reasonable defence. I am not a lawyer but I am sure that would be the case. Similarly, section 4(1)(b) states that a licensee shall not “permit a drunken person to consume intoxicating liquor” but that refers to him or her knowingly selling liquor to a drunken person and there are no reasonable grounds on which to defend that. If one serves such a person, one is subject to a monetary penalty and, subsequently, closure.Section 4(1)(c) refers to a licensee permitting drunkenness to occur in a bar and there is no reasonable defence for this. Deputy Costello referred to reasonable steps being taken to address “ the conduct being complained of” in his amendment, but if one permits drunkenness, where does reasonableness come into it? It is pretty black and white. I do not support the Deputy's amendments in this regard.

I do not want to go over old ground but there is consternation among hoteliers, in particular. The Minister stated he would review this issue next year when he introduces the codification of the liquor licensing laws. When responsible people such as John Power, chief executive of the Irish Hotels Federation become concerned about such an issue, I would take notice.The problem is that in many hotels the bar comprises the lounge, the lobby and the reception desk. Like my colleague, Deputy Deasy, I agree with all the provisions being introduced by the Minister but this provision will create major difficulties for hoteliers more than for publicans. It will make life impossible for them. Perhaps it might be possible to do something regarding the difference between a hotelier who provides rooms and people who operate bars only.This provision will create difficulties and I raise this issue in an effort to ensure the legislation will operate effectively. I totally support everything the Minister is trying to do but this provision will be inoperable and it is creating significant concern among hoteliers. The Minister should try to redefine the provision to make it more acceptable and operable for them.

"Bar", for the purposes of being in a bar, means any open bar or part of a licensed premises, exclusively or mainly used for the sale of intoxicating liquor. One cannot be in a counter, a reception desk, a hatch or anywhere else. We are concerned with the offence of being under age in the bar of a licensed premises.The definition does not create the problems about which the members of the Irish Hotels Federation have been warned. The measures I have put in place in respect of events that can be held in bars and at which children and 15 to 18 year olds can be present are reasonable. I reiterate that the members of the Irish Hotels Federation must understand that I will not distinguish between hotels and pubs because hotels are cheek by jowl with pubs on many streets in rural and urban Ireland. If I were to introduce a law which allowed 17 and 18 year olds to stand at the bar of a hotel but not at the bar of a publican two doors down the street, it would be a disgraceful discrimination and under age drinkers would flock to hotels. I will not do that and no amount of letter writing will convince me that I should.I have listened carefully to all the points that have been made and I have tabled an amendment regarding private functions. I have also pointed out to the House that the offence of a person under age being in a bar cannot apply, despite what members of the Irish Hotels Federation say, to the reception desk or porter's desk of a hotel. It means being in the bar of licensed premises and, having regard to what the term "in the bar" means, it means being in a place that is wholly or mainly used for the service of alcohol to the public.There may be a few hotels where all business, including key collection, is conducted in the bar and in which there is no lounge or reception but that is not common. Such hotels will have to make new arrangements because I will not allow 17 year olds to hold up the bars of those premises on the basis that the hoteliers have designed their premises so that it is difficult for an enforceable law to apply to them. The time has come for hoteliers to understand, like publicans, that people under the age of 18 cannot be present in a bar.

If a burglar enters a premises, one does not permit him or her to do so. Section 6(1) states, "A drunken person shall leave licensed premises on being requested to do so by the licensee. . . " and further states, ". . . he shall not seek entry to the bar of a licensed premises."  On a fair construction of the Bill when it is enacted, if somebody is drunk entering a licensed premises and the licensee or bar manager says, "Get out, you're drunk", he or she is not permitting the person to be in the premises and it is not an absolute offence in the sense that if somebody were able to sneak in through the back door or entered through a skylight, the publican would be found liable. Bearing in mind the contents of sections 4 and 6, I am confident no court will interpret this as being an offence which is permitted, regardless of the attitude or behaviour of the licensee.

In page 8, line 35, to delete "(1) or”.I already asked the Minister about this matter and I am still not clear why a person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2) is guilty of an offence. This should read, “A person who contravenes subsection (2) is guilty of an offence under this section. . . ”. Section 8(1) states that a person shall not engage – it is an exhortation – in disorderly conduct on licensed premises, but if he or she does, that person is guilty of disorderly conduct and shall do the following and so on. It appears that the offence only occurs if people refuse to leave the premises and not re-enter it. Subsection (1) should not automatically constitute an offence.

A marker must be put down that it is not acceptable for someone to be disorderly and drunk. Therefore, a €300 fine is reasonable. We saw recently on television how spaces in the accident and emergency departments in all our acute hospitals are taken up by people who are drunk. People who are drunk and disorderly can cause damage to themselves or others. It is quite obvious that these people who take up spaces in the accident and emergency departments are drunk and disorderly and, therefore, I have no compunction about fining them €300. This may in some way pay for the upset being caused to patients and staff in hospitals where people with genuine illnesses are being inconvenienced. The fines accumulated under this section should be ringfenced for the emergency services in the acute hospitals that serve these people who have injured themselves.

Disorderly conduct is defined in very broad terms in some instances. We discussed on Committee Stage the fact that anyone who is quarrelsome may be guilty of disorderly conduct. We are not talking about someone who strikes a fatal blow or wrecks a premises. It should certainly be an offence if that person does not leave the premises. I said on a previous occasion that the Minister could come under the definition of being somewhat quarrelsome. While not indulging in intoxicating liquor, because we are not talking about drunkenness, he could become fairly agitated during a lively conversation. It appears to me that "disorderly conduct" would be covered by the definition. I was concerned that someone as innocent as the Minister, just drinking a glass of orange, could be termed to be in breach of the legislation. If he were to leave the premises when requested, there would no problem. I am wondering about the two levels of offences and whether it is necessary to include them as two separate offences.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	878	The term "quarrelsome" is already included in the relevant licensing Act. It is not a new term. I do not think it simply refers to being disputatious; it is regarded as someone who sets a disorderly argument in train.Section 8 criminalises engagement in disorderly conduct on licensed premises. It also criminalises a person who has engaged in such disorderly conduct, who does not leave the premises or who tries to get back into the premises within 24 hours of leaving them. If I were to accept the Deputy's amendment, section 8(1) would not be criminalised. The Deputy is inviting me to say that section 8(2) is sufficient. I gave an example on Committee Stage. If I shout "get him" in the middle of a licensed premises, and start an almighty melee or riot, whether anyone can get to me with a view to requesting me to leave may be entirely irrelevant if the result is that the pub is wrecked.The original offence of urging other people or engaging in behaviour which endangered other people or started the riot should be criminal in itself. If I were to accept the Deputy's amendment, no crime would be committed for being disorderly unless the management of the premises managed to get to the person and said "get out" and that person refused to do so. That is not a very good way of dealing with the matter.Criminal behaviour, by being disorderly on premises, can be committed by people who are never asked to leave or who never leave. If management pointed out to a garda in the middle of a disorderly scene the person who started it all by their insulting or violent behaviour, such a person should be liable to be arrested regardless of whether anyone has managed to communicate to him or her a request to leave or regardless of whether they had or had not left.

In page 9, line 20, to delete "first" and substitute "second".We discussed this matter at considerable length on Committee Stage. It is a fairly harsh decision to close down a premises on a first offence. Later in the section, a premises will not just be closed down. It states that the licensee shall affix to the exterior of the premises, in a conspicuous place, a notice specifying the period of closure and stating that the closure is in compliance with the order.I understand the procedure that operated in the United States – the chairman of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights will know better than me – was that one would get a warning for a first offence of that nature. Part of the warning would be a request to appear at a counselling session where the rigours of the law, the purpose of the law and the need for its enforcement would be clearly explained in order that legal compliance was assured. We want to ensure legal compliance rather than an initial harsh first strike. That was the idea behind the amendment.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	881	I have some sympathy for this amendment, although that is not to say I will vote for it. A premises can be closed under sections 4, 7 and 17. Section 4 provides for closure in the case of permitting drunkenness or drunken persons on the premises and section 7 states that a licensee shall not permit disorderly conduct to take place. Some licensees argue that there is no way under the sun they would allow disorderly conduct but that it occurs, and they might be in a position where disorderly conduct occurs through no fault of theirs. A temporary closure order could then be put in place on the first offence.Section 17 deals with the consumption of intoxicating liquor near the licensed premises or in an off-licence. There are various situations which could arise in which it could be imputed that licensees did something wrong but they may not be able to prove they did not. Again, licensees may face closure on the first offence.It has been suggested by the licensed trade and others that instead of closure for a period not exceeding seven days, a substantial fine could be imposed for a first offence. I presume that period would not come at the start of Lent but at another time.There is a possibility that a licensee could feel he or she has been treated unfairly, although that treatment would seem fair to a District Court judge. I have some sympathy with the idea of a fine and I would like to hear the Minister's comments.
#DonnieCassidyFF	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-party	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-dob	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	882	I agree with Deputy Ardagh. There are people who would not deserve the maximum punishment, yet it is possible they would receive it. However, the Minister will probably say that according to the spirit of the Bill, if a licensee has a house of abuse, particularly regarding drugs, then this section addresses that issue. There may also be difficulties with alcohol being bought or secured unethically or with alcohol being interfered with. However, a licensee going to court for a first offence will face a judge with discretion.I would not like a licensee to lose his or her livelihood for a weekend, compared to two or three days from Monday to Thursday. Licensees may have major investments in their premises and depend on their business for the family income and livelihood. There are also many overheads and substantial repayments to be made. Certification could be addressed in a certification Bill next year. I agree with Deputy Ardagh's views on this.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	883	The effect of Deputy Costello's amendment would be that closure would not be available for a first offence. As Deputies Cassidy and Ardagh know, the great majority of licensees do not have a conviction of this kind on their records. The question is whether a closure provision in these circumstances would have any deterrent effect if everyone knew that, as in Monopoly, they had one "get out of jail free" card because they would not be closed for their first offence.We are trying to bring in a law which will change the attitude of that minority of publicans who allow drunkenness on their premises, regardless of whether they have previous convictions. If we include this provision, which means one free offence without closure, then people will relax and think that until they have gone through the District Court process, having been caught once, this will not apply to them. That is my worry, as it would make the deterrent aspect of the provision very small.Regarding the mandatory closure order, I stress that it is open to a judge of the District Court to apply the Probation of Offenders Act. In any particular case, although the facts are clearly established beyond reasonable doubt, the judge may decide, having regard to all the circumstances, to record the facts as proven but not proceed to a conviction. The closure order would not then apply.In cases where a closure order is made, the maximum period of closure for a first offence is seven days, but the one day option is open, so it is not too bad. The closure could take place for one day at a date 30 days after the District Court makes its order, which is not a massive deterrent. It will not put anyone out of business or sink a viable pub to have to close for one day. In those circumstances, a District Court judge could hear a plea for leniency on the part of a licensee and if it were not that serious an offence, I hope the judge would go to the lower end of the spectrum when making the point to the publican. Even though the premises may be closed for only one day for the first offence, it is liable for closure for a month for the second offence. A shot would be sent firmly across a publican's bows if this offence were committed.It comes down to this: If we go along with what is being suggested then, effectively, everyone is given one free go. If we say that that is the law for drunkenness on premises – that if one has never been caught before then one is never closed for the first offence – the deterrent effect is very small. Bearing in mind what I said about the Probation of Offenders Act and that the purpose of the Bill is to bring about a change in culture and of heart among the minority of publicans who are being irresponsible at present, the Bill as it stands is correct.I was struck by the curious irony in the suggestion of a substantial fine rather than closure, although it was obviously well intentioned and I fully understand the idea behind it. It struck me that this proved the case – that closure is regarded as much more serious than a substantial fine. Letters in this regard were written to me as well as to everyone else in the House. The reason is that if one is running a superpub or substantial premises – or if one is selling drink to under age customers in a supermarket with a view to consumption outside the premises – then it seems a fine is not as big a deterrent or severe a penalty as a closure order, even for one day.Those letters have been written to me as well as to everybody else in this House. A fine is not as big a deterrent or is not regarded as severe a penalty as a closure order of even one day. I take the point made by Deputies Ardagh and Cassidy. I fully appreciate that Deputy Costello is not trying to render the legislation toothless but if we were to make this change, we would send a message to people that they have one free go and that we are only serious about repeat offenders. The message would go out that as long as one had never been convicted, the section would hold no threat. If we want everyone's behaviour to change and everyone to be affected by the legislation, we should leave it as it is.

The Minister is talking about closing down a premises for a period of time and of putting up a sign stating the premises has been closed. I do not believe it is so much the cost. I would not be pro-publican on this issue. It is a case of the penalty fitting the offence. If the Minister is going to have the same penalty for somebody serving intoxicating liquor to a minor as for somebody being drunk and disorderly – the manner in which it is defined is very broad – he is, in a way, undermining the law because the penalty should fit the offence. There is a difference in terms of seriousness between the offence of selling alcohol to a minor and the offence of having a person who might be drunk and disorderly on a premises. That is my concern.

If we are serious about this, there should be a scare tactic, that is, a closure. However, the legislation refers to a closure for a period of time which could be one second. It does not state whether a premises should be closed for one day or whatever but for a period of time not exceeding seven days. A judge could close a premises for an hour or for one minute. The reason for the concern about a closure does not relate to loss of earnings for one day or for seven days but rather to the loss of business. If business goes elsewhere, it could affect the viability of the premises.I am concerned about the workings of gardaí, the enforcement of these laws and about victimisation. We can say victimisation does not occur too often, but it has happened. The most recent case which has come to light is the McBrearty affair. We should try to ensure there are some rules in this Bill so that victimisation does not occur because the offence about which we are talking is difficult to prove. How can somebody prove whether somebody was admitted to a premises?A small premises might be full to the brim after a match and one might not see a drunk sitting in the corner. I worked in a small pub which usually held ten people, but one night there were 150 people in it. I could not see everybody from behind the counter. If a garda entered such a pub and decided it had to be closed because he or she had clashed with the publican on occasion, he or she could state there was a drunken man sitting in the corner for two hours and that obviously he must have been admitted and permitted to drink even though there might not have been a drink in front of him. That is the difficulty. Although the Bill is well-intentioned, there are laws in place. If they were enforced, maybe we would get somewhere. I still do not know from where gardaí are going to come to enforce this legislation.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	886	I take Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point. If gardaí want to abuse the law, they will do so. We cannot devise our laws on the basis that they may be abused by gardaí. The majority of gardaí would never contemplate abusing the law and, therefore, I must construct laws on the basis that they will be operated by the majority of gardaí rather than by a malicious miscreant who happens to be in the force.I ask the Deputy to have regard to the definition of a drunken person which was changed between the heads of the Bill being published and the Bill as presented. All these cases must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. If there is doubt, it is resolved in favour of the accused person. A drunken person must be a person who is intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension – that is an objective apprehension – that he or she might endanger himself or herself or any other person. It is not just a matter of being merry, jarred, having slurred speech and so on. That is not drunkenness for the purpose of this provision. It is not even a case of one's behaviour being visibly altered. It is where it has reached a point where one is a danger to oneself or to somebody else, whether one is falling down drunk, one is seriously incapable of standing up vertically or one is in such a state that one is likely to cause a danger to others, either by hitting them or falling against them. That is the type of drunkenness about which we are talking.The impracticality of a lower threshold was pointed out when we published the heads of the Bill, that is, that people's intellectual ability was substantially impaired and so on. We opted for a definition which was clear and objective. What I have in mind are the kind of scenes we saw on "Prime Time", that is, people who are slumped against walls, who are falling down on the street, who are a danger to themselves and to others, who are so drunk that they could wander out in front of a car and endanger the driver of that car or themselves or who knock people down as they go down the street. That is what is provided for in this Bill.Somebody who permits drunkenness on his or her premises is judged by that yardstick. A decent publican who cannot see into the snug should not be a position where he or she is penalised because somebody gets merry sitting in it. I am referring to a person who gets so drunk as to comply with this definition—

There are many terms but I must be careful because I could get into serious trouble if I used some of them. There are many colloquialisms, some of them vulgar, for the kind of drunkenness about which I am talking. One needs to be, on a reasonably objective basis, a danger to oneself or to others. I am talking about drunkenness in those terms.I would prefer if people did not get intoxicated to that extent. It may be that purists would argue that they should not be even half way towards reaching that stage. However, we must have a law whereby a District Court judge can say, on the basis of the testimony he or she hears, that the person passed a serious threshold. In other words, the description of the drunken person was one which went beyond the threshold of drunkenness provided for in this Bill rather than people arguing as to whether people were raucous, rowdy, slurred in speech, merry or whatever other phrase one might like to use.Socially drunk is a phrase that is sometimes used. Bearing in mind that definition, Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point is covered.

In page 11, before line 1, to insert the following:"PART 3*Regulation and Control of Marketing and Sponsorship of Intoxicating Liquor Products10.–(1) A person who advertises, or causes the advertisement of, an intoxicating liquor product is guilty of an offence.(2) The Minister may, upon the application in writing of a press distributor, exempt from the application of subsection (1) advertising of intoxicating liquor products contained in such publications as are specified in the exemption concerned for such period (not exceeding one year) as is so specified, where it is satisfied that–(a) the publication concerned has a circulation in the State–(i) in the case of a daily or weekly publication, not exceeding 3,000, or(ii) in the case of any other publication, not exceeding 1,000,(b) it would not be practicable for economic reasons to require–(i) the excision or omission from the publication of an advertisement the inclusion of which in a publication distributed in the State would, but for the granting of an exemption under this section, constitute an offence under this section, or(ii) the publisher concerned to produce an edition of the publication for distribution solely or mainly in the State,(c) no part of the publication is printed specially or mainly for distribution in the State, (d) any advertisement of intoxicating liquor products contained in the publication islawful in the place where the publication is printed or first published,(e) the publisher of the publication does not publish an edition thereof that does not contain advertisements of intoxicating liquor products,(f) the publication is not produced solely or mainly for the purpose of promoting the smoking or sale of intoxicating liquor products, and(g) the publication is not produced solely or mainly for sale or distribution to persons who have not attained the age of 18 years.(3) This section shall not apply to an advertisement in a publication in respect of which an exemption under this section is in force.(4) An exemption under this section shall be in writing.(5) The Minister may revoke an exemption under this section where, in respect of the publication concerned, it ceases to be satisfied in relation to any one or more of the matters specified in subsection (2).(6) In this section–‘advertisement' includes, but is not limited to, every form of recommendation of the product to the public, including, in particular–(a) the statement of the name of the product or of any brand, trade description or designation by reference to which the product is sold, where such a statement may reasonably be regarded as a recommendation of the product to the public,and(b) the statement of any properties of the product on a label, container, wrapper or package used for the product or in a leaflet, circular, pamphlet or brochure issued to the public or given to a purchaser of the product, and cognate words shall be construed accordingly,‘press distributor' means a person who carries on the business of supplying newspapers, magazines or other periodicals to persons for the purpose of their selling those newspapers, magazines or periodicals by retail,‘publication' includes a newspaper, magazine or any other periodical.".This incorporates Deputy Costello's amendment as well. Much of this was discussed on Committee Stage. I said on that Stage that drinks companies would not be pouring millions of euro into alcohol advertising if it was not effective.Some elements to this Bill will be very difficult to enforce, but if we took a strong line on alcohol advertising it could be very effective. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot, on the one hand, all say that there is a crisis here but, on the other hand, not be prepared to take these kinds of measures and ban alcohol advertising completely.When I brought this up on Committee Stage the European excuse was cited – that there are difficulties with banning advertising as the EU Commission could potentially make a complaint in that regard. As I said on Committee Stage, this does not cut any ice for me because many Ministers in this Government have made a career out of ignoring Europe when it suited them. This problem is big enough and serious enough for society and is costing us so much money that we have to take quite drastic measures, in some cases, to deal with it.The Minister has admitted or acknowledged that these advertisements are targeted towards young people. That is the case. More evidence is coming out now that excessive alcohol consumption is having devastating health effects on young people. Our suicide rate among males aged between 18 and 24 years is directly linked to alcohol consumption. Clinical psychologists are telling us that it is having a drastic effect on young people's health, and we cannot ignore this any longer.Every time I have brought this up, and I have done so many times, members of the Government have cited legal and legislative impediments and argued that is not a practical measure. I do not believe that to be the case. Many of the sections and measures in this Bill will be extremely difficult to enforce. The enforcement is not there as it is. This is something that we badly need to do, and it would have some effect on the kind of problem we have with alcohol right now. I will be pressing this amendment.

The Minister said at the outset in launching this legislation that he was anxious to get it through because of the urgent need to do something about the disorderly conduct and drunkenness that is more at large than was previously the case.The Minister has introduced a number of measures to try to do that, a number of which I would disagree with. Some of them are unworkable and there are problems with quite a lot of them, but there would be no problem with introducing regulations to either prohibit or restrict the sale, advertising, marketing or display of intoxicating liquor. The Minister could introduce legislation that would allow for certain products to be prohibited because they are targeted exclusively at young people, contain very high volumes of spirits and are presented in such a fashion as to deliberately seek to mislead and pretend that they are connected with good living, good health and sport.If the Minister was serious about getting something done urgently, this is the type of regulation he would introduce. One of the regulations that he proposes in a previous subsection – I think it is subsection (20) – is to put an end to the happy hour. That is a type of promotion, so I cannot for the life of me see why the Minister will not broaden this out to look at the whole area of advertising. It is a multimillion euro industry. I think €38 million was spent last year, and a lot of that is used in a misleading fashion to target young people in particular and to link youth, sport and quality of life in a misleading way. That type of promotion and advertising should be immediately subject to the Minister's regulations. If he is serious about introducing measures urgently that will deal with the problem of excessive consumption of alcohol, I would like him to include such regulations.

There is a need to attenuate greatly the advertising of alcohol. It is disgraceful to see some advertisements on television which promote certain alcohol brands by making them sexy and socially acceptable and effectively implying that if one drinks a particular type – whether it is shots or small measures with very high alcoholic content – one can gain in such qualities. At the end of the day they have the opposite effect. After those drinks are consumed there is a depressing effect, as we all know to our cost at some stage during our lives, and it does—

Well, maybe not. I noticed in the newspapers recently that a new drink is being promoted, and the chairman of the health committee had an article in a newspaper insisting that this drink, Roxxoff, no longer be allowed to be sold in bars. There is an intention to market it at this point in time, and I would be opposed to the marketing of such a product.

Deputy Deasy has included exemptions in this amendment. One of the exemptions is for publications published abroad and containing advertisements which it was not economically viable to publish in Ireland. Surely, however, if a publication published abroad was completely full of drink advertisements and came into this country, there is no doubt that it would not be viable in Ireland with no advertisements in it at all. There is a need to change the amendment.Subsection (2)(f) is interesting. I do not know whether there is a typographical error in that paragraph.

"  It is interesting that the word "smoking" is used. I am totally in favour of banning smoking in bars.The Labour Party spokesperson on justice, Deputy Costello, together with myself and others was recently involved in investigating various licensed premises in areas where no smoking was allowed. It was a pleasure to sit down and imbibe in areas where one was not surrounded by smoke and did not have smoke in one's eyes, ears and hair. It is a pleasure to drink in such an environment. Despite what ardent smokers say, a smoke-free environment will improve the ambience and enjoyment of the leisurely drink to which we in Ireland have become accustomed in pubs and hotels. However, I understand this is a matter that comes under the sphere of influence of the Minister for Health and Children rather than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I put down a marker that I would support any legislation the Minister for Health and Children might introduce on the attenuation of the advertising of alcohol.As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said on Committee Stage, I do not see anything wrong with advertisements which claim that Guinness is good for you or wine is €9 a bottle in Superquinn and €11 in another establishment. There is a need for people to be able to market their products in a sensible and reasonable way that will not in any way take advantage of young people. Most television advertising takes advantage of young people, which I oppose.

I agree with limiting the advertising of drink products. I am the last person who could speak with authority on this subject because I have never taken a drink in my life. As a licensee, I have observed that people who drink pints of Guinness or Budweiser seldom, if ever, get into difficulty compared with some young people, in particular, who drink shorts and get into great difficulty and create enormous problems for themselves at a young age.On the amendment, an enormous amount of kudos is due for the train of thought behind its drafting, on which I congratulate Deputy Deasy. However, I must pay tribute to the enormous contribution Guinness has made to sponsoring advertising for many activities, particularly sports such as hurling which are good for people. When we were playing at home for the county – not that we achieved very much – we were told that the greatest gift one could give one's body was to ensure it was fit because when one had a fit body, one had a fit brain and when one had a fit brain, that gave one confidence and when one had confidence, one moved mountains. That is what we were taught. It would defy logic – as my colleague behind me would know because he played for our country – to put a pint of Guinness into one's body after training for two hours.

Huge kudos is due to Deputy Deasy for addressing the advertising of shorts and other alcohol products targeted at young people.Smoking should be banned immediately anywhere food is consumed as a first step. Smoking is absurd and goes completely against common sense. Having smoked 50 cigarettes a day at one time and ended up in hospital for some time as a consequence of the effects of smoking, I have enormous experience at that level. One has a great quality of life when one does not smoke. Smoking can damage one's health and reduce the quality of the last ten years of one's life. I support any measure to ban smoking in the long-term and, in the short-term, smoking should be banned immediately where food is consumed.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	904	I, too, am grateful to Deputy Deasy for tabling this amendment. The issue he raised is important. I am not disposed to accepting his amendment for a number of reasons which I will outline. The point about the European Commission is genuine. It would not be possible for me to accept this amendment and bring it into law without infringing European law. I would have to notify the Commission of an intention to do that. That is probably the most technical of the reasons.I agree with what Deputy Ardagh said. I do not find it offensive to be told that I can buy a particular bottle of wine in a particular supermarket. Such advertising does not worry me. Neither does it worry me that Budweiser sponsors the Derby. I do not believe anyone would infer that if one drank Budweiser, one would be able to ride a winner at the Curragh. I enjoyed Budweiser's hospitality on that occasion. I do not think Budweiser was implying that any prowess of mine, be it sexual or athletic, would be enhanced by consuming its product on the occasion, although maybe as it was the sport of kings, there was an implication that drinking its product would be a passport to majesty of some kind.I also make the point that the consumption of alcohol is a big industry. To bring in new products, one must advertise them. They cannot be hidden away and not advertised. Advertising will always be with us in some shape or form. There are obvious implications and Deputy Deasy's amendment attempts to deal with some of these regarding the print medium and transnational circulation, but there are others in the case of television advertising. British television and satellite stations carry spirit advertisements while RTE and TV3 do not. We can make all the laws we like, but it is a bit like King Canute, can we actually enforce them?It is appropriate to draw this matter to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and to ask him to consider whether he can regulate television and press advertising and other promotional activities directed towards young people, in particular, by way of regulations. I do not have the health analysis, the Civil Service support machine or the policing mechanism to enforce an advertising regime of this kind. I cannot go to television stations and sit looking at advertisements to decide whether they correspond with some particular provision.As regards the notion that alcohol enhances one's sexual prowess, I remind Members of the scene in Macbeth in which the porter says that drink provokes the desire, but takes away the performance. More Shakespeare might be something we should consider in that context.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	909	I appreciate this opportunity to discuss this serious issue in Navan regarding jobs in the carpet factory. Monday brought the most serious blow to employment in Navan for many years.The liquidation of the internationally-renowned Navan Carpets was a dark day for the town. It was one of the largest employers in the town, employing over 220 people, many of them married couples, and brothers and sisters, people who have worked there for the last 20, 30 or 40 years. Many of these people are not retrainable, despite what the Minister, Deputy Harney, has said, and it will be very hard to find new jobs for them. Apart from the task force to find new jobs, I also want a task force to help to try to save Navan Carpets.Navan Carpets is like one big family. Not only has it provided people with jobs, it has been their way of life. Some of those people have worked there for over 40 years. In some cases, families through three generations have held jobs there.This closure has come about because of a combination of reasons, and the Government's economic policy has not helped. The reasons include the rise in the value of the euro and massive insurance costs. Navan Carpets paid just over €9,000 per week just for insurance cover. This is not good enough, and I blame this Government for that. These are crazy figures. A fall-off in the international and domestic markets for carpets is also one of the reasons for closure.However, I believe this gives us the opportunity to look again at the operation of Navan Carpets and to make sure it does not close. I want this Government to do all in its power to keep alive the close association between Navan and carpets. Navan Carpets has been like an industrial ambassador for this country, providing a display of skill and craftsmanship all over the world. This is why I want a task force established to keep these people in jobs. I do not accept that Navan Carpets should be let close. I am shocked that that has been allowed happen and I am very interested in knowing what discussions have taken place with Enterprise Ireland over the last number of months to keep this factory in my home town open.I not only want a task force, I want action, and it must be fast. The name of Navan Carpets must be kept alive, and its carpets kept in the stores and on the markets. I am asking that through the office of the Minister, all the various bodies enter meaningful discussions with the liquidator with the aim of retaining Navan Carpets, keeping it in production and saving as many jobs as possible. I accept, as do the staff, the need for some rationalisation and restructuring, but we must attempt to save the factory. It is not good enough to let it go down the Swanney. A bit of financial help will also be needed, though not a whole lot. This company made a profit of €500,000 million in 2001. It lost only €1.5 million last year, which is not a lot of money when it comes to creating jobs.I also want this Government, through its contacts in the US and elsewhere, to find new markets for Navan Carpets. When buying a new house, it is everyone's aim to have Navan carpets in it, but people cannot afford that. That is because of the cost of living in this country. That will change, and if we can keep Navan Carpets open for another year or two the market will change, The tradition of carpet manufacture must be kept alive in this country. If we let it slip now, I fear that in years to come we will be grant aiding foreign companies to come here to produce carpets.Navan Carpets has been in operation since 1938 and it cannot be let go like this. It has survived through thick and thin before, mainly thanks to the staff for accepting wage cuts, etc. With some clever intervention, I believe it can survive this crisis. Action and political will is needed. This tradition and our good name in the carpet industry must be kept alive regardless of the cost. There is no reason to let this slip and it is an ideal area to train young people in the manufacture of carpets. We should build up this industry in Ireland. We are crying out for other industries to come in.The amount of money required would not be massive. The company made a profit in 2001. Its losses in 2002 only amount to approximately €6,000 per employee. If the records are checked I can guarantee that most of them paid more than €6,000 in tax that year. It would not cost the State a considerable amount to get involved here. I do not want to hear ten reasons why this cannot be done; I just want it done. If necessary, some of the State bodies should get involved in the running and management of Navan Carpets. We have hundreds of good staff in all these bodies, many of whom are able to talk the talk; now it is time to let them walk the walk. We should let them become involved to restructure Navan Carpets and make it viable.I want a rescue plan to be put together that will work and save these jobs. I also want the Tánaiste, through her good offices, to establish a task force for jobs in Navan. We have always had very vulnerable industries in Navan. The Crannac furniture factory closed recently with the loss of 40 jobs. In one industrial park two other industries, Case New Holland and Plaut, have closed. More than 350 jobs have been lost in Navan resulting in a major unemployment problem. The population that has moved from Dublin has doubled the number of residents in Navan, but no jobs have come with that. We need to keep a close eye on Tara Mines, which is a vulnerable industry sensitive to the fluctuating dollar. We need to do all we can to keep this alive.The name of Navan Carpets is known throughout the world and to let it go would be a great shame. It would be almost as bad as closing the railway lines in the 1960s. People have gone off wooden floors and in three or four years' time, they will be looking for carpets and will have to go abroad. What a shame it would be.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	910	The recent spate of job losses in various parts of the country, many of them in indigenous Irish enterprises, raises numerous questions about the Government's strategies and tactics for job retention and creation. Together with the loss of 230 jobs at Navan Carpets and the loss of 16 jobs at Laserform in Drogheda, which I will specifically address, there have also been job losses at Classic Catering in Drogheda, Powerscreen Limited in Kilbeggan and Flextronics in Cork, among others. According to statistics released by the CSO at the end of June, industrial employment has shrunk to levels recorded before the economic boom. A breakdown of those figures shows that employment levels are decreasing in almost all industrial sectors.I was asked by Sinn Féin councillor, Joe Reilly, to raise the serious situation that has now arisen in Navan where an additional 300 people will be on the dole within a four-week period. The people of Navan are devastated by the closure of Navan Carpets, an indigenous industry and a world renowned name in carpet making, which has been an employer in the town for 65 years. The closure of Navan Carpets along with the recent closure of Case New Holland and Crannac have dealt a serious psychological and economic blow to that town. In the words of Councillor Reilly: "Navan has suffered at the hands of this Government and previous governments. The town has been passed over time and time again by successive Governments in recent years."I call on the Minister to fast-track the plans for the development of the new business park for indigenous industries in Navan.Workers at Laserform in Drogheda were equally shocked at the announcement that Laserform was to go into liquidation on Monday. Drogheda has been bypassed industrially for some 40 years in terms of attention from IDA Ireland. Any job losses in Drogheda will have an adverse effect on a town with a very small industrial base. The Minister should instruct IDA Ireland to focus on Drogheda and Navan before these two towns go into terminal industrial decline.We need to see a real strategy from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment to deal with job losses, which goes beyond simply setting up a new task force each time a factory or business closes. Workers in places such as Drogheda and Navan must be provided with jobs in their own towns. There is a huge fear among the workers resident in these towns that the Government will ignore their plight because they are so-called commuter towns and that they will be forced to join the masses who currently travel to Dublin each day to work.Increasingly, we see that multinational companies, which received inordinate amounts of grant aid from the State during the boom years, are uprooting and moving to developing countries where they can access cheap labour. There is a necessity to provide indigenous industries with the same quantity and quality of resources as are made available to foreign investors. We need an economic development strategy that creates a balance between inward and indigenous investment. We need to encourage both small and large-scale indigenous companies with a research and development anchor, while also recognising that some 80% of employment in our economy stems from small and medium-sized enterprises. Investment in indigenous companies will have a beneficial impact on ensuring job security for Irish workers.An IDA Ireland official once said it would take time but he was confident he would achieve early progress in bringing employment to Navan. However, Councillor Reilly asks how, IDA Ireland could not do this in the good times, the people of Navan could have confidence in IDA Ireland or the Minister in the bad times?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	911	I thank the Deputies for raising these matters on the adjournment and I share their regret and concern at the closure of this long-established company and the loss of their carpets with which we have been familiar for decades. Navan Carpets became a subsidiary of Youghal Carpet Holdings in the 1970s and I was familiar with it having carried out the audit in Navan on many occasions. It is regrettable that it has now come to this stageThe company has been experiencing particularly extreme trading difficulties over the past two years. Its major market, US hospitality, hotels and casinos, has cut back dramatically on investments. That also brought about the demise of Youghal Carpet Yarns in Carrigtwohill a number of months ago. While sales, profits and exports increased steadily until the end of 1999, the market became more competitive from 2000. Sales have declined over the past three years and profits have turned to losses in the same period.Considerable losses have been incurred by the company over the past two years. The downturn in the US and domestic market and a weakening dollar are the major factors that contributed to the mounting losses in the company. Unfortunately, the market was not picking up and costs were continuing to increase. The position of the company was no longer sustainable.Some time ago, the board of the company appointed an external consultant to report on the options open to it. The board decided at a recent meeting that as the company was insolvent there was no possibility of restructuring it to enable it to attain profitability. Accordingly, Navan Carpets did not have a viable manufacturing future and could no longer continue to trade. The board decided to initiate an orderly wind-up of the company. This led to an extraordinary general meeting of the company on Monday 30 June 2003, for the purpose of winding up Navan Carpets Limited and the appointment of a liquidator.Arrangements have already been made for representatives of the company to meet representatives of FÁS. This meeting will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 3 July. I understand that the full services of FÁS, including re-skilling and suitable training and job placement opportunities, will be made available to the workforce.As regards job losses at Laserform, the company manufactures steel rule dies and blanking tools and accessories for the box and carton making industry in Drogheda. The managing director of Laserform (Ireland) Limited has indicated that he hopes to sell the company as a going concern in spite of current trading difficulties. Enterprise Ireland will work, where appropriate, with any interested parties with a view to establishing the new company if there is a viable future for the business.Currently, in Navan Business Park, IDA Ireland has 70 acres of serviced industrial lands available, and six projects are already located there. A number of IDA client companies are doing well in terms of employment in Navan, Kells and Dunboyne. Generali International in Navan is currently planning a 57-job expansion and this will see employment grow to more than 90 in its financial services project. There is also a new 60-acre business park under development in Drogheda.Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work intensively with existing local industries to assist them in increasing their capability and international competitiveness and has recently launched a special €10 million competitiveness fund for this purpose. Enterprise Ireland has supported the development of community enterprise centres in the region. These facilities, which are developed in partnership with local communities, facilitate the growth of new enterprises.As regards competitiveness, generally, the Government is already taking measures to improve our competitiveness which will play a critical role in the fight against inflation by strengthening competition across the economy and implementing specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas such as insurance. The Government is also increasing investment in research and development and in key infrastructure areas such as broadband telecommunications.On the specific question of setting up a task force, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, wishes to emphasise that the State development agencies are fully committed to the promotion of employment creation in the Navan area. The State agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, including the Meath County Development Board and Meath County Council, as well as other local bodies and interests, in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development. This existing co-operative framework can be used effectively and efficiently to deal with job losses and job creation in the Navan area. Given the representation of the State agencies and the county council on the Meath County Development Board, it is considered that, should any further co-ordination be necessary, the county development board would be the most appropriate forum to fulfil this function. Accordingly, the establishment of a task force is not envisaged.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	912	I wish to share time with Deputy Enright. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.Kilbeggan is a small town located on the junction of the N52 and N56 with a population of 500 people. The loss of 118 jobs at Powerscreen Limited is a blow to that community. If one was to compare it to a city venture in Dublin or Galway, it is the equivalent to closing Intel or Hewlett Packard. I am disappointed that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not present for this debate. There have been 118 jobs lost in Kilbeggan, 230 in Navan and 12 in Drogheda. Perhaps, she has a good reason for not being present. I hope the Minister of State will convey to her our concern for the jobs that have been lost.I was disappointed at the end of the previous speech where it was stated that no task force would be established for Navan. It is pathetic to think that the Government is not interested enough to provide a task force to find replacement jobs. If there were jobs being announced we would have a glow of cameras in the place with photocalls and so on. However, now on a weekly, if not a daily, basis we have job losses with not a word about them.Kilbeggan has two main employers with Powerscreen and its 118 jobs and Galtee Meats. I express my sympathy to the Powerscreen workers, who were let go at such short notice, their families and the wider community. I hope the Minister's office will intervene to ensure that there is a decent redundancy package for these workers. This is a lucrative multinational company which can put together a good package for the workers who have been so loyal to it. I am disappointed that no task force will be established.

This closure follows those of Flextronics, Leoni, Cybercable, Daiber and Lowe Alpine Systems in County Offaly over the last two years. Tomorrow is the second anniversary of the meeting of the delegation from Offaly County Council with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We have yet to receive any response from her. The State agencies have failed us as well as the Government. We need an adequate response at this point in time.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	914	The closure of Powerscreen has had an impact on my colleagues' areas. It was an unanticipated closure. Was the early warning system that was supposed to be in place as part of the national agreements invoked? As Deputy Paul McGrath said, Kilbeggan is an important and strategic town located on the N52 and N6. These losses are coming on top of a number of other job losses in the midlands region as alluded to by Deputy Enright. County Westmeath has suffered significant losses from the closure of Tarkett and William Hill in Athlone with some losses at Ericsson.The 118 employees have a wide array of skills and we must ensure that the State agencies get involved. The Kilbeggan Development Association has played a significant role in providing an industrial estate there. It is important that it is part of a task force. I would be disappointed if the establishment of a task force was not announced tonight. I hope the company gives its employees a reasonable redundancy package in September.It is a bombshell to those employees and will have an impact on their families, many of whom have mortgages. That is at the micro level. However, for every direct job loss there is a wider impact on ancillary areas. It is important that we move quickly to ensure that alternative employment is secured. The Government says that it can only create the environment for job creation. However, it often claims credit for job creation with which it had nothing to do. The Minister of State has a role in resolving the unemployment situation in Kilbeggan and the other midland towns that have been impacted of late. He must move in co-operation with the IDA, the Kilbeggan Development Association and FÁS to secure this.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	915	At the outset I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the adjournment. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has been ill for the last few days and that is why she cannot be in the Chamber this evening.The Minister learned with grave disappointment of the recent decision by Powerscreen Limited to cease production at its long-established Kilbeggan facility with the loss of 118 jobs. She is very conscious of the effect which the closure of this plant will have on Kilbeggan and most immediately on the employees and their families.The Kilbeggan plant primarily manufactures mobile screening equipment for export and use in the recycling and construction industry. According to the company which is US owned, the decision to close was taken because of a combination of changes in the marketplace, product issues, increased manufacturing costs and exchange rate pressures. It is understood that redundancies will commence in August with final closure in late September.In reaction to the closure announcement at Powerscreen, FÁS, the national training authority, contacted the company yesterday to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made redundant to find suitable alternative employment. FÁS will make available its full range of support services including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses. FÁS will also ensure ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.The State agencies continue to aggressively market the area, which forms part of the BMW region, as a priority location for jobs promotion by the agencies. Recent announcements which show that the strategy is having positive results in the midlands include Abbott Laboratories' announcement of a €70 million greenfield investment in Longford, creating 600 jobs.This follows from announcements by Oakley to establish a 100-person prescription eye-wear facility in Mullingar and the expansion of the GMAC facility, also in Mullingar. In Tullamore, GeneMedix has established its European centre for the manufacture of generic bio-pharmaceutical products. Irish companies, Cement Roadstone Holdings and Century Homes recently announced expansions in the area, which will lead to some 200 additional jobs.Additionally, IDA Ireland initiatives in the midlands include a comprehensive IDA property programme in place on the Athlone's Garrycastle business and technology park; two new technology buildings of approximately 25,000 sq. ft. are complete and are being actively marketed by IDA Ireland; and a further office unit of 14,000 sq. ft. is also complete and is currently being marketed. Tullamore business park is being upgraded and all infrastructural work will be complete by July 2003. The State agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, including the Westmeath County Development Board and county council, as well as other local bodies and interests, in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development. This existing co-operative framework can be used effectively and efficiently to deal with job losses and job creation in the area and that, effectively, is the task force.Given the representation of the State agencies and the county council on the Westmeath County Development Board, it is considered that, should any further co-ordination be necessary, the county development board would be the most appropriate forum to fulfil this function. The Minister and I would like to assure the Deputy that the State development agencies, under the aegis of the Department, will continue to market County Westmeath for investment and will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the workers affected by the Powerscreen Limited (Ireland) closure.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	916	I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister for coming in to respond to it.An elderly constituent of mine received an unsigned and undated document from the District Court, which had a case number and a fine number attached and a demand for €130. It appears that a lady charged with shoplifting in a department store gave the name and address of this elderly constituent of mine. A garda from Store Street Garda station dealt with the case. As a result of the intervention of a concerned neighbour who visited the Garda station to find out what was happening, the garda visited my constituent at her home and having met with her confirmed to her that she was not the person involved in the shoplifting incident. This visit happened only because of the intervention of the neighbour who was concerned for my constituent.My constituent was given to understand by the garda who visited her that a letter would follow, confirming to her that she was not in any way guilty. No letter arrived. However, in mid-April, a notice addressed to my constituent and signed by a garda from Sundrive Road Garda station, was delivered to her address, stating that a number of warrants were processed for her arrest and imprisonment. This lady is 76 years old and lives alone. As one can imagine, she was terrified by this turn of events. It had already been confirmed to her that she had no involvement in the shoplifting incident. On her behalf I made a number of telephone calls and wrote to the Garda, requesting clarification and confirmation of her innocence.As far as she is concerned, she is still at risk of being arrested and thrown into jail. Her name is on a file somewhere with this charge against her. I need to know that the matter has been resolved; that it is confirmed to my constituent that she was not the person involved in the shoplifting incident; that her name is removed from the file; and that she will not be served with another summons or warrant for her arrest. She also needs an apology for all the distress she has been caused. It is not good enough that an elderly person can be left to worry about an incident like this for months.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	917	I thank Deputy Upton for raising this matter for debate on the adjournment.I can well understand the annoyance caused to this lady as a result of the events the Deputy has outlined. I understand that on 2 September 2002, gardaí arrested a woman for suspected shoplifting in Dublin city centre. The suspect gave her name and address as that of the lady to whom the Deputy refers. It is clear that the sequence of events was set in motion by the woman who was arrested on suspicion of shoplifting and who gave the name and address of an elderly and blameless lady to the Garda as her own.When the accused person subsequently failed to appear in court, a series of events was set in train which resulted in correspondence regarding estreatment of bail proceedings and a bench warrant for non-appearance. That is the normal procedure. If somebody does not appear, his or her bail is estreated and a notice is sent out in relation to that matter and to the effect that a bench warrant for non-appearance has been issued.However, I understand that the arresting garda met with the lady last October – I now hear this was at the intervention of a neighbour – and satisfied himself that she was not the person he had arrested. He informed her of the position there and then, and assured her that she should not worry and that the matter would be attended to. Subsequent to the Deputy's contact with the local Garda, I understand that the local warrant officer also gave assurances that she had no cause for worry. I am informed that at no stage did a garda call to the lady's house for the purposes of executing a warrant.I have been informed by the Garda today that a letter has been issued to Deputy Upton's constituent explaining the matter and reassuring her with regard to her position. I have been in touch with the Garda authorities but, in the time available, it has not been possible to ascertain the level of detail which I consider is necessary to give the Deputy a full response in this matter.In view of the fact that we are coming to the end of the Dáil term, the Deputy probably felt it was better to raise it on the Adjournment rather than put down a parliamentary question which might not be answered until October. I am not at all suggesting that it was inappropriate for the Deputy to act as she has. As I was in London today and since this matter was raised fairly late in the day, I have not had an opportunity to go into the matter in the detail which I would like in order to fully deal with it. I will communicate further with Deputy Upton regarding this matter and, in the meantime, I want to extend my regret for any inconvenience, anxiety and worry caused to the lady in question by these events.It was a cruel and mean thing for the suspected shoplifter to use the name of an elderly woman in that way. The Garda is confronted every day by people who are arrested for offences on which they are entitled to due process. They are entitled to be set at liberty pending trial. On occasions, gardaí have to take at face value information which is given to them. On this occasion the Irish people were the victim of a cruel hoax but the Deputy's constituent, in particular, was the victim of a cruel hoax.I have to say in favour of the Garda that the investigating garda went and satisfied himself, at the intervention of a neighbour, that this hoax had been perpetrated. I regret that the mills of God grind so slowly and so fine in these matters that once the computer system gets going it is hard to stop.On the other hand, I wish to assure the lady in question, through this House, and through Deputy Upton, that she stands without any blame of any kind whatsoever in the eyes of the law or the gaze of the State. I will ensure that this is emphasised to her in writing and that whatever steps can be taken to ensure that this incident does not have any further echoes or reverberations for her will be taken. I know that it is easy for me to make that promise and then for some computer generated form to land on her doormat the day after tomorrow. If anything further does go wrong she should remain assured that it is just the result of a system operating and she should take it in good heart.The Dáil adjourned at 11.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 July 2003.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	918	I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.I have had the conclusions of the European Council laid before both Houses. On Wednesday, 25 June, the earliest opportunity following the Council, I made a comprehensive statement on the outcome of the Council.I made clear that the Council was a major success for the European Union. It marked a further milestone in the enlargement of the European Union with the Heads of State or Government of the ten accession states attending as observers; it warmly welcomed the outcome of the European Convention and it accepted the work of the convention as a good basis for the start of the intergovernmental conference; it set out a detailed work programme in the area of justice and home affairs; and it approved the appointment of a new Governor of the European Central Bank.For further details, I refer Deputies to my Dáil statement.

Ministers and their Departments provide information to him on the status of the various commitments contained in the programme. This material was subsequently compiled and edited by one of my advisers.The document was distributed to the national and local media in the normal way by the Government Press Office. The report was also distributed to members of the Oireachtas. A full copy of the report can also be accessed on the Department of the Taoiseach website.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	920	I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 36 together.As Deputies will recall I reported to the House on 21 May last on the arrangements in place in my Department to monitor the implementation of the new agreement Sustaining Progress. As Deputies will be aware, my Department exercises the main co-ordinating role for the overall implementation of the agreement.In this context, my Department chairs the steering group, which has overall responsibility for the management of the implementation of the programme. The steering group held its second meeting on Friday, 13 June and is scheduled to meet again on the Thursday, 10 July.The inaugural plenary meeting, which I will attend together with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance, will take place in Dublin Castle on 18 July. While the agenda still remains to be finalised, it is expected a presentation by the Department of Finance on the medium term economic outloook will feature.In addition to the annual plenary meeting, I also meet representatives of individual social partner organisations on a regular basis. In this context, I have been invited by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to speak at their annual Conference on 4 July.In the case of the Community and Voluntary Pillar of Social Partnership, the member organisations are those that have endorsed Sustaining Progress. The membership of the pillar has changed both as a result of the review of participation in social partnership undertaken in accordance with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government and the decision of two organisations not to accept Sustaining Progress. The community and voluntary pillar now has fifteen member organisations which have endorsed Sustaining Progress, six on an individual basis and nine organisations in the strands of older people, disability, housing, children, rural, local-voluntary, and care. My Department met the pillar to explain the arrangements to support the Sustaining Progress agreement and the social partnership process more generally. I also had the opportunity to meet the new member organisations of the pillar at that time.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	932	My Department has accepted an offer from Florence Properties Limited for the sale of Clancy Barracks, Dublin. The process of effecting first registration on the title to this property in the Land Registry has recently been completed. The legal formalities attendant on the sale have proven to be protracted but it is hoped that progress will be achieved at an early date. Pending the signing of the contract for sale, it would not be appropriate to comment on the details of the sale.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	933	As I indicated to the House on 15 May 2003, investigations were being conducted by the military police and the Garda into the circumstances surrounding the discovery on 15 April 2003 of an improvised explosive device on a grassy area inside the perimeter of Gormanston Camp. The device, which was discovered by a member of the Defence Forces based in the camp, was disarmed by a Defence Forces explosives ordnance disposal team. Sections of the device were taken away for forensic examination by the Garda and the remainder was destroyed in situ by means of a controlled explosion by the team. I am advised that the Garda investigation is continuing and that the military police investigation cannot be finalised until the Garda investigation has been completed.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	934	Permanent Defence Force personnel are obliged to vacate married quarters within a short period of the date of their discharge. Over 50 married quarters are being overheld by former members of the PDF or their families, however. The provision of housing is primarily a matter for local authorities and married military personnel have an equal claim on such housing as other members of the community in the same income category. Meetings have been held between departmental officials and the overholders, as well as with officials of Kildare County Council. In cases where houses have been offered for sale to overholders, the Department has sought the co-operation of Kildare County Council in ensuring that mortgages are made available to eligible applicants and some progress has been made in this regard.My Department is continuing to examine all options, including affordable housing and voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, relating to the rehousing of overholders who would in the normal way be eligible for local authority housing. Co-operative schemes are financed under the terms of the capital loan and subsidy scheme operated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the local authorities. The Department will be in further contact with the overholders in due course.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	935	As the Deputy will recall from my reply of 15 May, the Defence Forces do not possess armaments of the type referred to by him. Specifically, the issue of cluster bombs and depleted uranium in relation to the capabilities, including munitions, offered by member states in the context of the Rapid Reaction Force has not been discussed during any of the meetings of the EU Defence Ministers held to date.As I also mentioned in my reply of 15 May, the planning process for a Petersberg Task operation includes the drafting of a concept of operations, which includes the operation plan and rules of engagement for the respective mission. This plan is specifically tailored to the nature of the proposed operation. It is at this stage that the specific military capabilities which would be required are identified and member states have the opportunity to raise any concerns regarding the deployment or use of weapons which might be contributed to the operation by participating countries. I should add that in accordance with EU crisis management procedures the concept of operations is then submitted to the Council for approval by unanimity. The hazards posed by unexploded cluster bombs in a post-conflict context is of serious concern to the international community, which is endeavouring to address this question through discussions within the framework of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. In December 2002, state parties to the convention agreed to give a mandate to a group of governmental experts to negotiate a new instrument on post-conflict remedial measures of a generic nature which reduce the risks of explosive remnants of war.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	936	The tender competitions for the supply of the aircraft for executive transport are being carried out under EU contracts procedures. The evaluation of the tenders is ongoing. The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to discuss the contents of any particular tender at this stage. The award of contract criteria set out in the tender documentation states that the contracts will be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tenders in both competitions applying the following award criteria listed in order of priority: (1) tender prices; (2) functional characteristics for mission accomplishment; (3) maintenance, technical support and after sales service; (4) life cycle costs; (5) warranties offered; and (6) training packages offered.It is not permissible to use offset as an award criteria for supply contracts covered under the EU directives on public procurement. Therefore, it is not the practice of the Department of Defence to consider offset, countertrade or job creation issues as an award criteria or subsequently in the evaluation and assessment of tenders. In any event, it would not be possible to measure objectively the value of such offers in the assessment of tenders. The long-term economic effects of such offers would not be quantifiable for a variety of reasons. From the point of view of maintaining a truly competitive process, any consideration of offset, countertrade or job creation issues should only come into play after a decision to enter into contract negotiations with the chosen tenderer. Once a decision on the merits has been made on a particular contract it is the practice in my Department to seek offset in Ireland in the case of major contracts. It is, of course, made clear to the contractor that there is no legal or contractual obligation to provide such offset.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	937	Dr. Eileen Doyle and the external advisory committee group presented their completed report to me in March 2002. I accepted the report and recommendations in full. Action to implement the recommendations of the report has been a priority since that time. The follow-up action has been driven by an independent monitoring group, chaired by Dr. Doyle. This group meets regularly to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations. This group has overseen the following important developments in relation to this issue: the establishment of an equality steering group; the launch of an independent confidential help line and counselling service for members of the Permanent Defence Force; the launch of a revised administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces; the sourcing of training on a pilot basis for commanders and senior NCOs focusing on the area of prevention and resolution of interpersonal conflict, which the monitoring group identified as important to organisational development and change; the appointment of an independent body to design, administer and analyse an exit interview questionnaire for personnel leaving the Defence Forces; the identification and training of personnel with appropriate skills to act as contact persons to assist in allowing personnel to deal with bullying issues by an informal approach, where appropriate; and the use of focus groups to identify appropriate ways of enriching training at all levels.The equality steering group has engaged in an equality audit of various Defence Forces regulations and instructions. It has examined a range of matters including the legislation, regulations and administrative instructions, practices and procedures under which the Defence Forces operate. This examination is taking account of the current legislative requirements, best practice in employment in Ireland, the particular requirements of the military environment and the Challenge of the Workplace report. The equality steering group will ensure that progress is made both in relation to legislative requirements and best working practice.The independent confidential help line and counselling service provides a 24 hour, 365 days a year, freefone care line to all serving members of the Defence Forces. A counsellor is available to answer the care line at all times. The monitoring group plans to review the service after six months' operation. The service is fully confidential and is intended to complement existing personnel support services.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	938	Average defence expenditure in the EU was 1.85% of GDP in 2000, the most recent year for which figures are available. Defence spending in this country was 0.7% of GDP. The level of expenditure on defence in any particular country is influenced by a variety of factors, including that country's political and security environment, history, demography and economy. Defence expenditure in this country as a percentage of GDP will not increase as a result of our EU commitments.

Meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, in the format of Defence Ministers, are usually held during the course of each EU Presidency term. Along with informal meetings of Defence Ministers, they provide a useful forum for promoting dialogue and establishing co-operation between Defence Ministers in the context of the development of the European Security and Defence Policy.At the meeting in May, we discussed the continued work on the development of military and civilian capabilities for crisis management within the framework of ESDP. We also noted the start of Operation Concordia in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the progress of the EU police mission in Bosnia Herzegovina. The ongoing implementation of permanent arrangements between the EU and NATO was also welcomed by Ministers.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	944	The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.Currently, there are eighty 88 female officers serving in the Permanent Defence Force including one lieutenant colonel, 12 commandants, 30 captains and 28 Lieutenants in the Army, one captain and two Lieutenants in the Air Corps, and 14 lieutenants (equivalent to captain rank in the Army and Air Corps) in the Naval Service.

The report describes the Defence Forces mission and roles, military capability, organisation, personnel and deployment, and records significant improvement in areas such as training, equipment and infrastructure, as the implementation of the White Paper on Defence proceeds.The report also provides useful information on aid to the civil power operations in 2000, Government support activities including fishery protection, major emergency relief operations, and the provision of air services, including search and rescue. The report also details our peace support activities overseas.The report serves as a very useful reminder of the important work done by our Defence Forces at home and abroad in the service of the State and often in the most difficult circumstances.

The decision was necessary to meet the ever increasing demands of Government business, not least in the context of a significantly enlarged European Union. The decision to replace the aircraft is not solely related to the period of Ireland's Presidency of the EU and hence the decision was to acquire aircraft which will be operated by the Air Corps.The two tender competitions for the acquisition of the aircraft, a long range aircraft and a smaller seven to nine seater aircraft, are now in train. The closing date for the receipt of tenders for both competitions was 30 May 2003.The tender competitions allowed for the submission of both new and preowned aircraft and all options such as outright purchase, lease, lease purchase, or other alternatives were open for consideration.

To date 40 of these vehicles have been received and a further 25 vehicles are scheduled for delivery in 2004. The total cost of the programme is in the region of €84 million.In addition to this programme, the Defence Forces has a requirement for a smaller light armoured vehicle, designated as a light tactical vehicle which can be used to protect troops engaged in peace support operations in areas where the larger Mowag APC would be inappropriate. For instance, the movement of one to three personnel in high risk confined areas and general surveillance work are amongst the key roles of the vehicle.Funding for this programme must be considered in the context of the larger APC programme and the changed financial situation and it has been agreed with the military authorities that the programme for the acquisition of the vehicles will not proceed for the present. In the meantime, the Defence Forces will continue to conduct further studies in relation to the type and specification of vehicle required.

The concept entitled, A Secure Europe in a Better World, was delivered by Mr. Solana at the European Council meeting at Thessaloniki on 19 and 20 June 2003.As the Taoiseach reported to the House last week, the security strategy is a very interesting report, reflecting the Government's view that the Union pursue an holistic approach to security and that security has economic, political and development dimensions.The European Union has been instrumental in maintaining peace and stability on the Continent over the past 50 years. In addition the Union has developed highly sophisticated diplomatic, economic and social instruments which have improved the wellbeing of its citizens and helped to promote stability in other regions. Significant strides have also been made in recent years with the development of the European Security and Defence Policy which is already complementing existing EU instruments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, and most recently in the Democratic Republic of Congo.However, the post-Cold War world has brought new threats and risks to peace and stability which have been outlined in the High Representative's report. These risks range from famine and disease, to the increasing availability of weapons of mass destruction, failed states and organised crime.

Significant investment has taken place and I am satisfied that the Defence Forces are now well equipped for their day to day roles at home and overseas.The main priority for the Air Corps has been the purchase of fixed wing training aircraft. In that regard, I was delighted to sign a contract on 16 January 2003 for the supply of eight turbo propeller training aircraft to replace the Siai Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. The new aircraft is the Pilatus PC-9M, manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft Limited, Switzerland. The cost of the aircraft is approximately €60 million. Delivery of the aircraft will take place during 2004.Other recent additions to the Air Corps fleet include the second helicopter for the Garda air support unit and the Sikorsky S61 helicopter which is entering service in the search and rescue role in the north-west region, operating from Sligo Airport. In addition, tender competitions are in train for the acquisition of two aircraft for the ministerial air transport role to be operated by the Air Corps.

While the threat of terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis and assessment by both the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, the advice available to me is that the threat to Ireland remains unchanged and continues to be rated "low" by the security authorities. Notwithstanding that, it is important that all prudent precautions are taken and that matters are kept under continual review.The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the security of the State may be at risk. In addition, the Defence Forces have contingency plans in place in relation to the provision of aid to the civil power and the provision of assistance to the civil authorities for a range of emergencies.In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, the Government established a task force on emergency planning. The objective of the task force is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency. As chair of this task force, my objective is to ensure that such responses continue to be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements.The Office of Emergency Planning, OEP, which operates under my remit in the Department of Defence, is taking the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threats from global terrorism, including co-ordination of Government emergency planning and response by various agencies.

Based on the numbers of bovine animals over the age of six months declared by the person named as being present on his holding on each of the five census dates for 2002, a stocking density of 1.5057 livestock units per hectare has been established. A cross-check against the CMMS animal database was also carried out and the same stocking density was arrived at. Under EU regulations, where the stocking density of a holding is between 1.40 and 1.80 livestock units per hectare, payment may only be made at the lower rate of €40.00 per qualifying animal. On 5 June 2003, the person named was paid the sum of €560.00, representing full payment on his 14 qualifying animals.

An advance payment of €1,075.92 issued to him on 9 December 2002. However, at an inspection of the herd on 24 September 2002, it was found that one unclaimed animal was non-compliant with the identification and registration requirements as set out in clauses 37 and 38 of the terms and conditions of the scheme. The person named was informed of this shortcoming by letter on 24 September and 14 October 2002 and again on 17 April and 30 April 2003. Since a reply has not been received to the correspondence, the 2002 suckler cow premium application will now be processed for balancing payment, subject to an identification and registration penalty being imposed and a payable order should issue shortly thereafter.The herd of the person named was also selected for a 2002 extensification premium assurance inspection covering all five census dates. This inspection took place on 17 April 2003. The stocking density as calculated from the results of this inspection is sufficiently low to generate payment of extensification premium at the higher rate of payment of €80.00 per qualifying animal. Payment of this premium will issue to the person named following the payment of 2002 suckler cow premium.

In the agreement, my Department committed itself to implementing these changes at the earliest possible date. These are significant amendments to the scheme, requiring EU Commission approval and are likely to be considered in tandem with suggested changes emanating from the current mid-term independent evaluations of the NDP and CAP plan. It is envisaged that a revised scheme will be in place in early 2004. In the meantime, a meeting has been arranged with the farm bodies to discuss the situation in more detail.

The stocking density of the holding calculated on the basis of the numbers of bovine animals declared by the person named at the five census dates was 1.8014 livestock units per hectare. A cross-check against the CMMS animal database was also carried out and the same stocking density was arrived at. Under EU regulations, 2002 extensification premium may only be paid where the stocking density of a holding does not exceed 1.80 livestock units per hectare. As the stocking density in this case exceeds this limit he is not eligible for any extensification premium for 2002.

The person named was selected for an on-farm producer inspection and it was established during the inspection that two unclaimed animals, out of a total of 33 animals on the holding, were non-compliant with identification and registration requirements. This resulted in a reduction penalty of 6.5% on all eligible animals applied on under the suckler cow and slaughter premium schemes by the person named in 2002. A payment of €149.60, has issued in respect of the two animals under the slaughter premium scheme 2002, which reflects the 6.5% reduction penalty.The person named applied for premium on 16 animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme. An 80% advance payment for €2,869.12 issued on 11 December 2002 and a balancing payment of €484.17 was made on 30 April 2003. These represent payment on the 16 animals, less the aforementioned reduction penalty of 6.5% incurred due to non-compliance with identification and registration requirements.

An advance payment of €3,048.44 issued on 9 December 2002. However, at an inspection of the herd on 9 August 2002, it was found that one unclaimed animal in the herd was not compliant with the identification and registration requirements as set out in clauses 37 and 38 of the terms and conditions of the scheme, resulting in a penalty. The application was processed for balancing payment on 17 animals, less a 2.52% identification and registration penalty. Payment amounting to €666.09 issued to the person named on 26 June 2003.

In 1998 following agreement with the EU Commission to phase out Ireland's 10% corporation tax regime the Government decided to move to a general rate of 12% on trading income to be phased in over several years. The Finance Act 1999, accordingly, provided for the transition to the 12% rate. This came into effect on 1 January 2003. It will apply to certified Shannon companies when they cease to be entitled to the 10% rate under transitional arrangements. The EU agreement provided, inter alia, that no new Shannon projects could gain access to the 10% rate after 1999. However, those projects which were approved before the end of May 1998 will continue to benefit from the 10% rate until the end of 2005, while those approved between 1 June 1998 and the end of 1999 were entitled to the 10% rate until the end of 2002.The general rules for phasing out the 10% rate for manufacturing companies will also apply to manufacturing companies in Shannon. Those rules provide that manufacturing trades that were being carried on before 23 July 1998 will continue to qualify for the 10% rate in respect of eligible activities up to end 2010. Those arrangements also apply to manufacturing trades that were approved by an industrial development agency for grant assistance before 31 July 1998. In all other manufacturing cases the 10% rate ceased to apply from 1 January 2003.

Marginal relief restricts the maximum amount of tax payable to 40% of the amount by which the couple's total income exceeds the exemption limit. The inspector of taxes has examined the taxpayer's case. The taxpayer's estimated income for the current year is €39,438 and the inspector has calculated that the marginal relief system would be more beneficial to the taxpayer in 2003 than the normal tax arrangements and, thus, the marginal relief system should apply. As the taxpayer currently is being taxed under the normal tax credit system, the inspector is in the process of issuing an amended certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut-off points to the taxpayer and to the company paying his pension. When this certificate is implemented, the taxpayer will receive a refund of any tax over-deducted since 1 January 2003. The taxpayer should forward his P60 for 2002 to the inspector, who will review the taxpayer's liability for that year and refund any tax which may have been overpaid.

In the case of farmers, the total amount of income tax paid by them in 2002 was €126 million. In the case of the other professions for which information is sought, the relevant information which can be provided relates to income taxpayers whose principal source of income is derived from non-PAYE sources equating broadly with self employment. Excluding tax paid by farmers, the total amount of income tax actually paid by taxpayers in this category in the calendar year 2002 was €1,820 million. This figure includes yields from underlying tax liabilities on bogus non-resident accounts as well as payments of withholding tax on professional fees. It does not take account of receipts of deposit interest retention tax and dividend withholding tax for which a breakdown between employees taxed under PAYE and self-employed taxpayers cannot be ascertained.

Some 16,800 are income earners whose principal source of income is derived from non-PAYE sources, equating broadly with self employment and whose gross income is estimated at €3,757 million.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the precise information requested by the Deputy in regard to tax paid and occupational categories either could not be obtained or could not be obtained without conducting an extended examination of the Revenue Commissioners' records relating to all income earners, including those in both the PAYE and self-employed sectors, which could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost. The relevant information which can be provided in relation to tax is of the estimated tax liability of income earners with gross incomes in excess of €100,000, for whom the total tax liability for the 2002 income tax year is estimated to be of the order of €2,987 million, with €836 million attributed to income earners whose principal source of income is derived from non-PAYE sources equating broadly with self employment.Notes:1. These numbers are provisional and are subject to revision.2. A married couple which has elected or been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.

Where the estimated value exceeds €162,293, a notice inviting tenders is published in the Official Journal of the European Union as required by the EU public procurement directives. Any interested supplier may submit tenders in response to these advertisements and notices. Contracts are awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender, determined on the basis of criteria detailed in the tender documents.For contracts with an estimated value of less than €65,000, invitations to tender are issued directly to at least five firms from the GSA's list of suppliers. Here again, contracts are awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender, determined on the basis of criteria detailed in the tender documents. Applications for inclusion on the GSA's list of suppliers can be made at any time. Selection of suppliers to be invited to tender for any particular contract is made on a random basis from among suppliers on the list, though in certain cases, ability to meet specific requirements of the contract may be taken into account.

Ireland's position on the death penalty is well known to the US authorities. Ireland is among those countries which have outlawed the death penalty and, together with our partners in the EU, we remain firmly opposed to the death penalty in all cases, irrespective of the circumstances involved. The Government believes the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights, and is committed to achieving its universal abolition.In conjunction with our EU partners, and in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty, we have expressed our concern to the Government of the United States at the continued use of the death penalty on a number of occasions by means of general and case-specific demarches and will continue to do so. The Government has also made clear to the US authorities, through bilateral channels, its concern that the detainees in Guantanamo Bay be treated in accordance with the provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law. The US authorities are well aware of Ireland's opposition to the death penalty and we will continue to make our position known on appropriate occasions.

To be eligible for free transport, children must live at least two miles from their nearest school and be attending that school. Children who live in a closed school area, i.e. where the closed school would have been their nearest school had it remained open, may be deemed eligible for transport to the school of amalgamation only. As the minimum number of eligible children required has not been met in this case, I regret it is not open to my Department to establish a school transport service.

The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department. The staffing at the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2003-04 school year was considered by the appeals board. The board was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case. The board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board in April. The decision of the appeals board is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.Teachers who are surplus to the approved quota of teachers in individual schools are placed on relevant panels for re-deployment to schools within the panel area which have fillable vacancies. There is no provision for such teachers to be re-deployed to schools which do not have fillable vacancies.

The GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the stability and growth pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue as is a standing committee established by my colleague the Minister for Finance to advise on the GGB implications of private sector financed projects.The position remains that consideration of the Cork School of Music project will be based on a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes going forward and taking into account the issues surrounding the general Government balance.

My Department concurred with the basic thrust of the master plan and agreed to the appointment of a design team for a first phase of development at the college.The first phase will provide a multi-purpose teaching hall – phase 1(a), a new auditorium – phase 1(b) and teaching space – phase 1(c). It will also include infrastructure works. Architectural planning on these buildings has commenced.The funding allocation for 2003 is based primarily on legally enforceable contractual commitments and architectural planning of all third level projects will pause at the end of their current stage pending clarification of the future funding position.I have decided that it is prudent to re-evaluate the overall position in relation to third level capital projects and establish priorities for future years. In this regard the Higher Education Authority, at my request, is undertaking a review of all capital projects in the third level sector to establish prioritisation and agree re-phasing in preparation for a building programme in 2004 and future years.The authority has established a working group, and all relevant third level institutions including Mary Immaculate College have been invited to make submissions to this group on all their capital requirements. Decisions in respect of all third level institutions will be taken when the review is complete and the funding position for 2004 and the subsequent years is determined.

The remainder of the grant will be paid on receipt of eligible paid invoices or certificates of payment from the club, with the exception of 5% of the grant, in this case €7,400, which is retained pending the receipt of certification of completion of the defects liability period of the project.The 2003 sports capital programme was advertised in the national newspapers on 23 and 24 March 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications was 25 April. A total of 1,330 applications were received before the closing date, including one from the organisation in question. All applications are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.

The health and social care professionals Bill is due to be published later this year.Under these proposals, it is intended to protect the title of "physiotherapist", that is, only those professionals registered with the registration board for physiotherapists will be legally entitled to use the title "physiotherapist". It is also proposed that it will be an offence under the legislation for an unregistered person either to use a protected title or to act in a manner which implies that they are entitled to use a protected title.In drafting the legislation, further advice and examination will be required of the many complex legal, competition and public interest issues that arise under the Bill, including in relation to protection of title.

In the case of the Dublin taximeter area, following a decision of the four Dublin local authorities, the current taximeter area incorporates the functional areas of the four authorities and any maximum taxi fare structure decided on by the authorities applies within that area. Under the public service vehicle regulations a taxi operating within the taximeter area must calculate taxi fares by reference to a taximeter and must not charge fares for taxi services within that area that exceed the maximum fare set for such services by the local authority. In the case of hirings that commence within a taximeter area and terminate at a location outside of that area, a taxi vehicle is not currently obliged to take such hirings. However, where such hirings are made, the fare to be charged and-or the manner in which it is to be charged should be agreed in advance with the person who is making the hiring.

The company subsequently sought amendments to this licence. However, before a decision could be finalised on the amendments requested, the service was withdrawn by the company. My Department was subsequently in contact with the company, but there has been no response to date.It is a matter for private operators, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus to propose bus services to cater for customer demand. A decision by an operator to cease operating a route is a matter for the operator concerned. The Road Transport Regulations, 1932 include provision for the transfer of a passenger licence to another licensed bus operator. It is also open to other operators to apply to my Department for a licence to provide bus services on the route in question.On 17 August 2000 my Department issued a licence to Aircoach to operate a service between Tallaght and Dublin Airport. The company did not introduce this service. Following a recent request from my Department for clarification of its intentions in this matter, Aircoach has now indicated that it wishes to renew this licence. My Department has decided to renew this licence and the renewed licence will issue shortly.

The Deputy's question refers to complaints from the Croke Park Residents' Alliance regarding the behaviour of gardaí in the environs of Croke Park on the occasion of the opening ceremony. I am informed by the Garda authorities that gardaí at Fitzgibbon Street station were responsible for the policing of the opening ceremony which attracted a crowd of more than 70,000 spectators and involved 7,000 athletes. I am also informed that in preparation for the event, two meetings were held with the Croke Park Residents' Alliance – an umbrella group of seven local residents' groups – to brief it with regard to the Garda management plan and the proposed restrictions that were to be put in place for the event. In addition, three newsletters were distributed including advice on parking arrangements and the level of restrictions being imposed and outlining the necessity for residents to carry the correct identification when seeking entry at the cordon points.

It is advocated in this documentation that judges should not be independent in their duties and functions but should be answerable to my Department. It should go without saying that I cannot accept this point which would involve constitutional change of the most fundamental kind and radically alter our system of government in a way which would be incompatible with Ireland's place in the international community. In so far as judges are criticised because of an alleged lack of courtesy towards litigants, an Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to bring forward legislation to provide effective remedies for complaints about judicial misbehaviour including lay participation in the investigation of complaints. I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill early next year.As regards the hearing of family law cases in general, I propose to change the in camera rule so as to allow for the general reporting of overall trends while continuing to respect the privacy of all those involved. I intend to publish the necessary legislation this year. Under the Guardianship of Infants Act, where in any proceedings before any court the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. Similarly, decisions on access must be based on the child's welfare and I would not support any alternative provisions on these matters. It is most desirable that children maintain contact with both parents, subject to the overriding consideration that the welfare of the child must be paramount.

The guidelines indicate that the provision of additional dwellings within inner suburban areas of towns and cities, proximate to existing or due to be improved public transport corridors has the potential for revitalising areas by utilising the capacity of existing social and physical infrastructure. This can be done by way of infill or through the sub-division of existing dwellings.

The designation of sites under the town renewal scheme was decided in the context of town renewal plans; this was in accordance with the Town Renewal Act 2000 and the 1999 guidelines on the scheme. It was a matter for each county council to prepare and submit such plans to the Department. Following submission, an independent expert advisory panel on town renewal assessed these plans. The panel's recommendations were accepted in full by the then Minister and this is the basis on which the scheme is now implemented.The sites and incentives selected for designation by county councils, examined by the expert panel and subsequently approved for designation followed a structured and considered process. The incentives for Banagher were granted on the basis of the proposals prepared and submitted by Offaly County Council and it is not possible to amend or add to the town renewal plans at this stage.

With regard to the scheme at Fána Búrca, it was considered that it should be possible to sell the houses without recourse to site subsidy. The development at Portumna was also considered affordable given the average cost of providing the houses is €125,165 which is considerably less than the available local authority maximum house loan. It is open to applicants in both developments to consider availing of the shared ownership scheme which offers home ownership in a number of steps to purchasers who cannot afford full ownership outright in the traditional way.

However, I understand from Waterways Ireland that the position in this case is that Waterways Ireland is selling the freehold interest in the property to the person referred to by the Deputy. Contracts have been signed and a deposit paid. I understand the deed of conveyance in this case was returned, by Waterways Ireland, to the Chief State Solicitors Office on 30 June, having been sealed and witnessed, and that office is now in a position to complete the sale with the purchaser's solicitor. Registration of the deed will be a matter for the purchaser's solicitors after the sale has been closed.

Area Development Management Limited manages this programme on behalf of my Department and funding for 2003 was allocated to the partnership by ADM Limited recently. The partnership must manage its programme of activities for the year, from within resources available to it. Therefore any decisions regarding the allocation of funding to support local projects is a matter for the partnership to determine.

As North-South implementation bodies, they are jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North.Annual outturns in relation to allocations made by my Department and its predecessor to Waterways Ireland since its inception up to 2002 and the Revised Estimates figure for 2003 are set out as follows.

CLÁR grants funds up to and equal to funds from the national rural development programme and, for innovative projects, from Leader+, subject to total public funding not being more than 50%. Leader can fund at least 50% of the agreed public funding with a maximum of 50% funding provided by CLÁR. The maximum amount of Leader funding may not exceed €65,000.The maximum grant rate from all public sources – both EU and national – for capital expenditure under the Leader programmes is fixed at 50% by the EU Commission. To exceed this limit will result in a breach of EU state aid rules. However, my officials have raised the issue of increasing rates for community-based projects with the Commission in the past but without success. In the context of the mid term review of the programmes, we will be looking again at this issue and intend to raise it with the Commission at the review's conclusion.The Leader programmes provide for significant amounts of voluntary labour to be counted as private funding thereby lessening the amounts of private funding to be raised. In many cases the amount to be raised locally is as low as 10%. An indicative list of what constitutes public and non-public funding follows:

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1079	A comprehensive study on the future financing of long-term care was carried out by Mercer Human Resource Consultants on behalf of my Department. The consultancy fee was €107,950 plus VAT. The consultant's brief was to examine three broad areas, namely the potential of the private sector or a combined public private sector approach to assist in financing-funding long-term care; the potential of the PRSI system to finance-fund long-term care; and whether the current system of long-term care financing, through taxation, should remain the status quo.The findings and recommendations of the report highlight the need for consideration of specific issues and the need for careful planning for the future. To make progress in the area of policy on long-term care, I now propose to prepare a consultation document to accompany this study which will aim to focus all interested parties on the specific issues we need to address. These will be significant issues including those in relation to benefit designs, cost and financing. These are discussed at length in the report. A consultation process on the financing of long-term care will then take place. This process will be undertaken by my Department in close consultation with the Department of Health and Children and will take place over about a three month period. It will be important that all interested parties take the time to study this report and in due course feed in to this consultation process.

Half rate allowances may also be paid in respect of a child in certain circumstances, for example where both of the child's parents are receiving a social welfare payment, or where one parent has earnings over a prescribed amount.The gains from standardising the rates of allowances would have to be weighed against the costs. In this regard to standardise the three main rates of allowances at the highest rate of €21.60 would mean that approximately 251,500 payments would be increased at a cost of approximately of €60 million annually. Since the time of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, which recommended a rationalisation of the rates of child dependant allowances, the number of different rates has been reduced from 36 down to the current three. The policy direction followed since 1994 by successive Governments has been to concentrate resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme which is neutral vis-à-vis the employment status of the parents and does not contribute to poverty traps.
