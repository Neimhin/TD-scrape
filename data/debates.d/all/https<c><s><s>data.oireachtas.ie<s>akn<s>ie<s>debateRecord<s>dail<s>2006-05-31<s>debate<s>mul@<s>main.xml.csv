#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The sequence of events that has unfolded demonstrates that this Government is a headless band of bunglers. It is time for the Government to come clean and answer questions following the devastation of the Supreme Court decision in respect of section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935. The Tánaiste is in the House instead of the Minister for Finance, who we were told would take the Order of Business this morning. It is a week since the court's decision, which is a long time in politics.I would like answers to three questions. How many men are in jail in respect of section 1(1); how many men are in jail in respect of section 1(1) and other legislation on sexual offences and how many men are in the system facing charges under this section? In other words, to what degree will Irish society be exposed if all of those men walk, as Mr. A did yesterday?Section 1(2) of the Act is almost identical to section 1(1) and deals with unlawful carnal knowledge of girls between the ages of 15 years and 17 years. I am advised that a challenge to this section is likely to succeed. If section 1(2) falls in the same way as section 1(1), how many men are in prison based on section 1(2) of that Act and how many men are currently in the system facing charges arising from section 1(2)? Does the black cloud hanging over section 1(2) not mean that there is effectively no offence in place to deter a man in a position of responsibility from having consensual sex with a girl of 16 years or under?Does the Tánaiste believe the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he says that he was unaware of the Supreme Court challenge until he read about it in the newspapers? Is this not incredible? The people do not elect the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General. Rather, they elect the Minister. The buck stops on his desk for political responsibility in this regard. Do the Department or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to whom we are all knee-high in political contribution terms, not read The Irish Times, which reported this on 13 July last year? Does the Minister not read the Law Society Gazette, in which a trainee solicitor pointed out in October of last year that this matter must be dealt with? When he wants the ultimate political opinion, does he just look in the mirror? What of the Government’s much vaunted and costly communications unit? Did this matter not get under its radar twice last year?Will the Tánaiste tell the House what has gone wrong? She must answer these questions in the public interest. This is an issue on which the Government has failed miserably to anticipate, be ready and deal with a gaping hole in current legislation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I share the outrage expressed by every decent person in the country that a man who plied a young woman with alcohol and pleaded guilty to carnal knowledge of her should walk free in these circumstances. Everyone is rightly concerned that something like that could happen. It is her plight and the plight of young women like her whose innocence has been disgracefully taken away that is our concern.I do not have all of the data in respect of the numbers requested by the Deputy. There are six persons in jail to whom section 1(1) applies. I will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to contact the Deputy regarding the other data, which I do not have to hand.Never in the House has any Government or spokesperson on justice suggested we should change the law and have as a reasonable defence a mistake in respect of age.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	2	That is not true.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I am informed that no one ever suggested it should happen and no Government ever sought to do it because we wanted to keep the strongest possible laws in place in this area. Recently, the Ombudsman for Children communicated with the Minister that, even now, we should not change the law. However, we have no option but to make a change on foot of the Supreme Court decision.On the question of knowledge, there was an information deficit. In November and December 2002, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was informed by the Chief State Solicitor's office that this action was being taken, but there was no information thereafter. Even in 2002 if legislation had been introduced it would not have had retrospective effect. It should be remembered that even then the DPP was strongly defending these cases right up to the end. People were still being prosecuted on the basis of section 1(1) and the case was won in the High Court in 2004. Even if we had changed the law at the outset of these proceedings, it would not have had retrospective effect. That is the reality. It could not have had a retrospective effect in respect of any person convicted at that time.As we know, the governor of Arbour Hill Prison will appeal yesterday's decision, a matter that will ultimately be determined in the Supreme Court and that will determine whether other persons serving sentences under this section can be released. It is a fact, and it is for the independent judgment of the DPP that it may well be that somebody could be rearrested and charged again in relation to other offences. That is entirely a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, not the Minister or anyone else.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Tánaiste's reply shows how out of touch is the Government. Fine Gael has a Bill before the House at the moment, dealing with a register in respect of sentences. The Tánaiste did not have the information in respect of section 1(1) and does not have the information in respect of section 1(2). She has not answered my question about whether she believes the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he says that he was not aware of this. Is it not incredible that the Attorney General, whose office was dealing with this along with the Director of Public Prosecutions, who sits at Cabinet and is in constant contact with the Government, especially the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, would not be aware that this case was proceeding through the Supreme Court and that the Government, on the basis that the Supreme Court would come to this decision, would not have emergency legislation ready to plug the loophole in the law for the future, as distinct from not being able to deal retrospectively with those who were charged under that section which was struck down by the Supreme Court?Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not know what is going on? Last night on television he said that the DPP continued to lay charges under section 1(1) of the 1935 Act until recent weeks. In the High Court on Monday, however, during the hearing of Mr. A's case, the court was told the DPP had not sought to proceed with statutory rape indictments and trials had been stayed by consent since last summer pending last week's judgment. The court was told that on Monday but the Tánaiste is defending the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who says there was no urgent need for serious legislation, there was no gaping hole in the legal system and that he did not know what was going on. This was reported in The Irish Times and last October a trainee solicitor pointed it out in the Law Society Gazette, but all the legal eagles and officers of both Departments and the Government were unaware of it, even though the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the person who says: “I see what I see and I know what I know”.In addition, will the Tánaiste tell me if the Government has agreed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's proposal to reduce the age of consent for girls from 17 to 16? I put her on notice that my party does not support that proposal. The immediate priority is to plug the gap in the law that now exists. The broader debate can be left to another day.What day will the Dáil meet next to dealwith this emergency legislation — Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Of course I believe the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

The Government was briefed yesterday by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General on the legal situation. We discussed various options and the intention is to have legislation later this week. The Cabinet sub-committee will meet the Attorney General later today to deal with the issue and the intention is that the Dáil will sit on Wednesday to deal with the legislation.If this was so obvious to everyone, why was it never raised in this House? Let us be real.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I know of no Government that has legislation in the drawer ready to be implemented because a matter is before the High Court or Supreme Court. We won the case in the High Court and it was not anticipated that it would be lost in the Supreme Court. Even if that had been anticipated, we would have had to wait to see the Supreme Court ruling to draft the appropriate legislation, which must be constitutional. It would not make sense, given the difficulties that have arisen, to bring in a faulty Bill. The Government will take the best advice available from the Office of the Attorney General and other counsel on the legislation and we hope it will be ready later this week.No decision has been made on the consent issue or the detail of the legislation. Yesterday was a briefing by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General. The legislation will follow later this week.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I am immensely disappointed by what the Tánaiste has just said. She seemed to assert that it would be unreasonable for Government to have anticipated the striking down of this particular section. How in heaven's name can she say that? Twice in May 2005, as I said in the House last week, legislation was rushed through in one day. That legislation was ready to go. To say that, on something as important as the protection of our children, no one was riding shotgun and that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform — the nightwatchman — fell asleep on the job is beyond belief.The public are staggered by the incompetence and lack of care displayed by the Government in this case. The Tánaiste is not well briefed. She was drafted in at the last minute last night to replace the Minister for Finance but it is untrue to say that no one offered the defence of honest mistake, something the Taoiseach repeated yesterday morning when he said, "Responses to the invitation for views disclosed no appetite for change among those who expressed views on the paper", referring to the discussion paper published in 1998 by the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Of course they did. I have the Labour Party submission with a summary of proposals on the first page. It states that we also accept the Law Reform Commission proposal that there should be a defence of reasonable mistake in relation to unlawful carnal knowledge. We made that submission in December 1998 but the discussion paper never went anywhere. It ran into the sand.The Tánaiste is wrong. I accept she is not misleading the House, she was just badly briefed. There is no point flapping here about partisan politics. She should have a word with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism beside her. If a letter went missing in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he had the House in uproar. In this case we are talking not about a letter going missing but about our young people being at risk and a gaping hole arising in the law. The Government, however, displays a laid-back attitude and claims that it did not know about it.The Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform says this is the responsibility of the DPP. That is grossly unfair. The DPP does not have a weekly slot on "Today with Pat Kenny" to defend himself. How can the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform claim that he and his Department had no knowledge, despite admitting there are channels of communication on such major issues?Those Fianna Fáil backbenchers who have broken ranks on this issue and those in the divided Cabinet are right. They should support the Labour Party Bill we published yesterday which permits the reinstatement of the status quo plus the defence of honest mistake. It is the interim legislation that is needed to protect us. While we are having the interesting debate about the age of consent and gender neutrality, which is complex and will take time, we need interim legislation to protect our children. Our Bill achieves that.The Government misjudged this on a gargantuan scale. There is no doubt about that. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said to Pat Kenny:Then we have to ask ourselves do we want to protect 15 year olds from randy 23 year olds, if I can use that phrase. It is not an easy one to legislate for on the back of a beer mat.I agree, it is not an easy one to legislate for on the back of a beer mat and, for that reason, we should close the loophole in interim emergency legislation. I want the Tánaiste to say to the House that the Bill will not be published on Tuesday of next week and enacted on Wednesday. The Opposition is entitled to be consulted about this. The 1935 Act was taken in secrecy in this House.

We do not want to be presented with legislation that we are supposed to enact when there is no room or tolerance of amendments. I ask the Tánaiste if the Opposition will be consulted before the weekend. What day will this House reconvene to enact this legislation? Does she not accept that of all the reputation this Cabinet has acquired for incompetence, this is the most grave dereliction of duty on behalf of Ministers collectively and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in particular? Does she believe that the Minister for justice across the water would be still in office?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Is there any accountability in this Government for any of the errors it makes?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	22	First, in case there is any misunderstanding, the reason I am here this morning is because of the importance of the issue. As the Deputy is aware, it is tradition when a Head of State visits the country for the Taoiseach to meet that Head of State and I was due to do it in his absence. That is the reason for the change in who took the Order of Business.Second, regarding the Law Reform Commission report, the Law Reform Commission drew attention to the fact that we had very conservative legislation on this area. It did not say it was unconstitutional and notwithstanding what the Deputy said, it was never proposed by any Deputy on the floor of this House that we introduce the defence of reasonable mistake. I suspect, and I am being honest about this, that if any Deputy had done so he or she would have been accused of writing a paedophile charter. That is what would have happened. They would have been accused of watering down the strong legislation and I do not believe any Deputy would have done it. That is why it never happened.Furthermore, it is wrong to say or imply that the Supreme Court has over-ruled all our legislation in this area. We have strong legislation regarding rape and sexual assault, and that still stands.The Opposition will be consulted later this week. It will not be a question of the Bill being produced on Tuesday and a debate on Wednesday. As the Deputy has acknowledged, this is a very complex area and already this morning a legal expert has cautioned us to be careful about this legislation. We do not want, for the sake of rushing legislation on one day rather than another, to get it wrong and have another mistake created in a few weeks from now. If it takes a couple of extra days in which to get it right, I believe genuinely that is what the public wants to see us do and that is what we will do.Regarding the Director of Public Prosecutions, the carriage of this case was jointly between the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	23	That is a change.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	24	That last point is another correction of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister plainly said yesterday evening that the carriage of this case was the responsibility of the DPP. He said he knew nothing about it, that the Attorney General personally knew nothing about it and that he could not say if people in the Attorney General's office knew about it. It is about time the Government got its act together. There are only two Progressive Democrats Ministers at the Cabinet table and they are divided. How many divisions are on that side of the House?Anybody who heard the interview this morning on The Gerry Ryan Show with the mother of this young girl can be under no doubt about the seriousness of this situation. I do not want to give legs to what the woman said but those Members who did not hear it, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in particular — I ask him to get a transcript of it — cannot be under any doubt about the gravity of the situation that confronts that family. In those circumstances, for the facts to continue to be dribbled out in the fashion we are now getting them is simply not good enough.I want to hear from the Tánaiste. On the question of the points she made, that is our submission. The man sitting beside her published the discussion paper in 1998.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	25	It was never proposed here.

The Tánaiste presents it to us as if it were some kind of exculpatory assertion by her to say the Minister did not know. If the Minister did not know, he ought to have known. Charles Clarke did not know either and he is kicking his heels on the back benches now. The Minister ought to have known on a matter of this important gravity.Can we have a clear statement from the Tánaiste about the convening of the Dáil next week? I thank her for the commitment to consult with the Opposition on this legislation but we need to know when we are meeting next week. We need to know if there is any clarity in Government concerning whether we are moving to shut this loophole or attempting to deal with the wider questions that are given rise to as a result of the Supreme Court decision. We need clarity on that. Are we moving to shut off the loophole or is the Government seeking to address issues and questions that I agree are complex and on which we need a public debate? In the interim, however, the parents of this country——

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I share the view of parents. Of course they want strong legislation in this area. The Deputy has acknowledged that his party took the view that the legislation was too harsh. I suggest the vast majority of people wanted to maintain harsh legislation in this area. It stood the test of time for 70 years. It was upheld in the High Court in 2004. That is a fact. I do not believe there would have been a will in this House to change what was called harsh legislation and make it more liberal in this respect. I do not believe the political will would have existed to do that.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I and the Independent Deputies want the Dáil to meet next week for a comprehensive discussion on these issues. The Tánaiste's Government is now a hobbling paragon of incompetence, exceeded only by its arrogance. This week it was forced to back off from bullying FÁS workers into involuntarily decentralising to the constituency of the Minister for Finance. Some time ago, when the Tánaiste could bluster no longer on the health crisis, she admitted it was a crisis. Last week, we heard a slight bleat from her about the situation in the "to be decentralised" State agencies, where 56 out of 2,500 workers only are prepared to decentralise and 158 out of 1,200 specialist and technical staff only are prepared to go. The Government has taken a valid idea, a necessary policy of balanced and equitable regional development, and turned it into a mockery and a shambles with a cynical and opportunistic approach. We are left with a mess this week.Communities in the regions throughout the country have been abused and given the impression that 10,000 public sector workers would be arriving in a short time to boost their local economies, a valid aspiration on their behalf. It was a cheap and opportunistic stroke with no prior planning, preparation or consultation. Mindful of the media fascination last week with the Taoiseach's facial arrangements, I can only equate the mess of decentralisation with a botched make-up job. It was slapped on in a hurry, there was no foundation, with blobs of paint which everyone could see through.

They could be wet boreens around Caherciveen. The Government has put in charge of this a colleague of the Tánaiste, a Minister of State whose first thought was to show up in his constituency in Offaly thinking that he had been cast to play a bit part in a remake of the man from Marlboro. Now he believes he is a real estate hustler playing Monopoly with the taxpayers' property and money, having alerted every speculator in the country who have now doubled and trebled the price of land around the regions.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	82	At least he could not do much damage in that role with regard to the economy, the country and regional development.This is a crucial policy of regional development which is very important to communities throughout the country as well as to Dublin which suffers from the terrible mess of traffic congestion etc. Applied in an organic and principled way, it could be a very positive policy for the people. It could improve public services and help communities. In the way this Government has approached it, bringing it forward as a cynical, opportunistic local election stroke, it has been reduced to the existing shambles.Will the Government allow this Dáil to have a comprehensive debate on the matter? Will it, for a change, come in honestly and put in front of the Dáil and the people of the country a method of proceeding in a proper, planned and realistic way? This would satisfy the needs of balanced and devolved regional development, as well as protecting the rights of public sector workers who have been used cynically as pawns.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	83	We wish to ensure that, on one hand, the decentralisation programme is done in a way which delivers effective public services. It should be done voluntarily and there should also be balanced regional development. Like many of my predecessors and my successor as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who have tried to convince some of the world's largest corporations to locate in regional areas of this country, I believe there is nothing wrong with the Government exemplifying this. It is achievable. A debate would be a good idea and the Deputy should discuss it with the Whips.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Will the Minister of State at least inform me of the way the information is collected? Is he able to say in respect of imported food whether it is apparent from these figures if the food originated in Ireland and was exported and processed in India, for example, before being re-imported? How would such food be categorised in the import and export figures which I have requested? Is it possible to deduce what traceability exists so we can be accurate about those figures?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The data presented here are a combination of custom base, non-EU trade statistics. It estimates from the Interstat survey of Irish traders involved in trade with other EU member states. With regard to food, some of the questions relating to traceability would be more appropriately directed towards the Minister for Agriculture and Food.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I did so. I was directed backhere.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	88	We do not have that detail. We simply have a list of commodity types such as beef — fresh, chilled or frozen — lamb, pork etc. Questions on traceability are more appropriate to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I raised the question with the Minister for Agriculture and Food and it was redirected to the Taoiseach. We must get to the bottom of the question. The import and export figures given in the response must be verified as such because food is no longer simply imported or exported. Food is processed along the way and other issues arise with regard to food safety, climate change arising from CO2 emissions and food transport, all of which need to be evaluated. These figures appear to be half-baked because they do not reflect the reality of how food is manufactured, traded and consumed around the world. It is time we differentiated those elements in the figures because, as they stand, they are not detailed enough to give the full picture.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I will be glad to revert to CSO officials to ask them what they can provide in addition to the detailed information they have given. I will be interested to see what further details are available to get to the bottom of the question, as the Deputy has requested.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The Central Statistics Office publishes quarterly releases on earnings in the following sectors: industry, distributive trades and business services, the financial sector and the public sector. The latest figures available are for the fourth quarter of 2005. They showed an annual increase of 3.4% in average weekly earnings for all employees in the industrial sector, 5.7% in the distributive trades, 5.6% in the business services sector, 5.1% in the financial sector and 6.2% in the public sector, excluding health. The consumer price index, also published by the CSO, rose by 2.5% in the 12-month period to December 2005.The earnings figures for the industrial sector also include a breakdown for broad occupational categories. Weekly earnings increased by 3.1% for manual workers and by 3.7% for clerical and managerial workers in industry between the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2005. Further details of hours per week and average hourly earnings are available for manual workers in industry. They show an annual increase of 2.1% in earnings per hour for manual industrial workers and an increase of 1% in their average hours worked per week.The trends in industrial earnings represent the situation for about one sixth of all employees. The industrial sector accounts for 266,000 employees, out of a total of 1,653,400 employees across all sectors, as measured by the latest quarterly national household survey for quarter four of 2005.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I understand the Minister of State is responsible simply for reporting on the statistics. Within that constraint I invite him to ask the CSO to examine what level of displacement the figures suggest. It appears that average earnings in the low-skilled sector, relative to other sectors, have reduced, which may be evidence of displacement. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Irish people who are currently unemployed are failing to get jobs in the open market because incoming workers from other jurisdictions accept rates of pay below what would previously have been acceptable to Irish workers. I am seeking a statistical reinforcement of that analysis. Can the Minister ask the CSO to prove the figures? Is the minimum wage, for example, without overtime or double time, being offered to workers on a shift pattern of seven days on-five days off, irrespective of whether those days fall on a Sunday or a bank holiday, as happened to a person in my constituency?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	93	That relates to a different area but I will comment on it. Interesting data have been published today in the latest quarterly national household survey on employment. Deputy Quinn raised the issue of manual workers in industry. Over the past five years, up to December 2005, hourly earnings for those workers grew by 32.8% and prices rose in the same period by 17.3%, which paints a different picture from that in the Deputy's question. In the ten years to December 2005 hourly earnings of manual workers in industry grew by 67.5% and prices rose by 35.5%. There is a duty on all of us to ensure the social partnership discussions on the minimum wage focus on the plight of lower paid workers.This morning I read the most recent quarterly national household survey and Deputy Quinn's question is relevant to what is contained therein. Employment has increased by almost 90,000, of which close to 50,000 are foreign nationals. The news on the growth of the economy and on employment growth are good, with almost 2 million people now in work. I held a brief meeting with CSO officials on the figures this morning and there is strong growth in construction, in wholesale and retail and in the financial and business sectors. The areas where we need to be vigilant about the potential for displacement include food processing, hotels and restaurants. The Government and the social partners will exercise vigilance in these areas but the overall picture painted by the quarterly national household survey is positive, with many new jobs created for Irish people and non-nationals.

Does he not share my concern that if he and I were among the 45,000 Irish workers around the country who have been unemployed for over a year, some under the age of 25, there is something wrong with our economy in the fact that of the 90,000 welcome new jobs, 50,000 go to foreign nationals?

My concern is that Irish people are being left behind.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to explore these issues. According to the data published today the total number in the labour force stands at 2,086,300, which accounts for 62.2% of all persons aged 15 or over. The Deputy's question was about long-term unemployment, which actually decreased by 1,600 to 26,200, the corresponding rate falling from 1.4% to 1.3%. That is an important figure but I agree with the Deputy that the Government and social partners must be very vigilant on the plight of low-paid, manual industrial workers. The Government will maintain its focus in that area.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Do the statistics indicate a casualisation of labour? To what extent does the CSO collect statistics on how casualisation of employment affects women? Are there separate statistics to show whether the gap between the rise in incomes and the rise in inflation in 2005 is more pronounced among women workers? Are specific statistics available on the average number of hours being worked by employees in this category? Anecdotal evidence indicates that a significant and increasing number of people work fewer than 19.5 hours per week, the threshold under which employment is classified as casual. In light of the shift towards a seven day, 24 hour economy, are statistics available on the days on which persons in this category work? Many of those engaged in this type of work are women casually employed in large multiple stores.In 2005, the Government, through the Central Statistics Office, announced that the number of people in employment had increased by 95,000 over the previous year. Given that the number of taxpayers did not increase by a similar number, does this indicate that a considerable gap exists between the types of jobs being provided and the rates being paid?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The employment heading covers all persons engaged by public bodies, including full-time employees, permanent and temporary, part-time employees and persons on holidays, maternity leave or temporary absence due to illness. The CSO is carrying out a new survey to measure earnings more comprehensively. The information from this survey will be more comprehensive than the statistics available from the current range of surveys and the main results will include trends in employee earnings and employers' labour costs. Information will also be compiled on employment job turnover, job vacancies and the number of employees on the minimum wage. A breakdown of the results by sector and broad occupational group will also be available. The CSO is, therefore, bringing many new statistics into play.I propose to refer briefly to the new information available on women at work from the quarterly national household survey. The survey indicates that 25,000 additional married women, primarily in the 45 to 54 years age group, are at work. Much of the data and many of the issues raised by Deputy Boyle will be useful for future planning purposes.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, together.The Lisbon Agenda remains of strategic importance to the Irish and European economies and the quality of life of our citizens. The Government is fully committed to the Lisbon Agenda and has been supportive of the process from the outset. Last year, following a mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda, the European Council decided to focus on the urgent priorities of growth and jobs. Each member state was required to prepare a national reform programme to address an integrated package comprising macroeconomic, microeconomic and employment policies. All member states are working together to address the key challenges, such as the need for greater research and innovation, creating a favourable environment for small business and jobs.This approach is operating in tandem with a Europe-wide social partnership process, with all the main stakeholders working together to achieve the necessary pace of reform and progress. Member states are conscious of the need to keep an eye on the global picture. The European Union now competes directly with other regions of the world for mobile investment in knowledge and research and the external dimension of competitiveness must acknowledge this reality.Ireland prepared its national reform programme in autumn 2005. The programme covers a three-year period to 2008 and will be reviewed annually. It recognises that the overall challenge is to sustain and improve Ireland's recent good economic performance. The programme includes a range of measures to ensure sound public finances, enhance our competitiveness and deliver sustainable employment. The various measures are drawn from the existing policy framework, including the programme for Government and the current social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. Implementation of Ireland's NRP is under way and the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment have lead responsibility for the macroeconomic, microeconomic and employment guidelines, respectively.Our social partnership process is a significant element of our overall strategy to sustain growth and job creation in accordance with the Lisbon Agenda. Negotiations on a new social partnership agreement are under way and any new policy directions or initiatives arising from these negotiations will be incorporated in the national reform programme over the three year timeframe.

Is the Minister of State aware that there is a pay gap between men and women's earnings across the European Union of 15%, a figure also reflected in the Irish experience? Is he aware that the Taoiseach, in his report on the Lisbon Agenda, stated that the ESRI had been commissioned to do a report on the graduate gender pay gap in Ireland? Will the Minister of State indicate the current status of the report? Has it been completed and presented?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	104	To which report is the Deputy referring?

If the Minister of State has the information to hand and is in a position to answer my questions, that is well and good, but if not, I ask him to furnish the details subsequently. Has the report been completed and presented, and what are its findings?The low paid and part-time employment sectors already show a pronounced imbalance between the sexes, with women predominating in both areas. Does the Minister of State agree that increasing the number of women employed in these areas is not an adequate response? Does he accept that the key in many cases is address of the child care issue and that additional measures need to be introduced to improve child care provision? I make no apology for saying that such measures, initially at least, must be biased in favour of families dependent on low incomes. A key needs to be produced that will open the poverty trap which denies women in such circumstances an opportunity to participate in the workforce if that is their choice.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Ireland's priorities regarding the Lisbon Agenda are to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances, enhancing our competitiveness through investment in knowledge and innovation and continuing to deliver more and better jobs, including full employment opportunities for men and women alike.The Deputy asked a number of questions pertaining to the ESRI report on gender equality. I am not aware that the report has been presented but I will pursue the matter and provide the Deputy with up-to-date information as quickly as possible.I am pleased with the changes we have made in different sectors of the economy, including in taxation. These have given opportunities to women of all ages to choose whether to enter the workforce, the sector in which they wish to work and whether to take permanent or part-time employment. It is critical for all citizens, including women and specifically highly qualified and skilled mothers in the home who have completed rearing their families, that the new system in place, notably in the area of taxation, allows them to re-enter the workforce and offer the economy the benefit of their experience and skills.Child care is a key issue in the modern economy. I am somewhat disappointed, however, that every decision to provide generous support for child care in recent budgets has resulted in an immediate increase in the cost of child care. In handling this situation through the creation of facilities across the country to distribute resources, we must be careful to avoid creating an inflationary spiral that would impede people from accessing existing opportunities, including their child care requirements. That balance must be carefully measured. I am pleased that we have been able to deliver child care services in urban and rural areas, which has not been the position in other services. Such services have been of major benefit to young mothers but there is still much more to be done as the economy grows and opportunities arise. Given the requirements of the economy, it is critically important that we continuously address the need to provide adequate child care. In that way, young people can meet their own responsibilities and have the choice to work in mainstream economic activities while being guaranteed a good, efficient, modern, professional and caring child care service. That is very important.

Notwithstanding the objectives of competitiveness and improved technology referred to in the Lisbon Agenda, the impact of food transport in terms of climate change rose by 12% from 1992 to 2002. In the overall context, if one was to discuss competitiveness without sustainability we would be heading down a pretty ruinous cul-de-sac. I wonder whether the implementation of sustainability has been measured by the Lisbon Agenda and whether the Minister of State has anything to report on that score.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Ireland welcomes the decision of Ministers to reach political agreement on the draft directive at the Competitiveness Council meeting on Monday, 29 May. The Council will formally adopt its common position at one of its forthcoming meetings and will forward the dossier to the European Parliament for a Second Reading. As regards the questions raised by Deputy Sargent, each member state is expected to submit a progress report by 15 October 2006. The EU Commission has issued guidance on the format of the progress reports and will hold bilateral discussions with officials in each member state over the coming weeks and months.Overall, it is envisaged that the preparation of the progress report will mirror that of the national reform programme itself with the Department of the Taoiseach leading the co-ordination. The Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will have primary responsibility for the various policy areas, while other Departments will feed in material as appropriate. Initiatives emerging from current negotiations with the social partners will be reflected in the progress report.A number of issues referred to by the Deputy were raised in this House earlier this year during the debate on the reform programme and in the Seanad debate also. They were incorporated into our final document which we submitted to Brussels as part of our national reform programme.The Deputy raised the issue of food transport but I do not have information on it. I will pursue the matter and revert to the Deputy later. The issues raised here will certainly be taken up in the progress report. It will be my responsibility to take into account what the Oireachtas says on such issues, which I will include in the document to be considered for the progress report in October.

From that point of view it is at the core of where the European Union is trying to go. Since it has been agreed, however, we have had the rejection of the Nice treaty in this country, and the second vote. In addition, France and the Netherlands have rejected the European Constitution, so there is a strong level of disillusionment concerning how the citizens of Europe are treated. There is a perception that they are not getting a fair deal and that in many cases Europe is somewhat irrelevant in the manner in which it is progressing, and is not responding to bread and butter issues of public concern. We have responded by establishing a national forum on Europe.

How will we get the message out to people that Europe is good for them unless we implement the Lisbon Agenda in a macro sense? When Ireland held the EU Presidency in 2004, we had a review which found that the outcomes of implementing the Lisbon Agenda were disappointing across all 25 EU countries.It is also disappointing in terms of social cohesion and what Mr. McCreevy was trying to do with his services directive, in addition to low incomes. The review also found that people had to rely on rent subsidies rather than having their own homes, and that there was a 15% gender gap between working men and women. The absolute inadequacy of child care and the lack of a proper energy policy were other elements of the review.

Where is all this happening? Nothing the Minister of State has said so far shows that there is any priority on the Government's part regarding any of these issues.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Having watched RTE last night, I was pleased with its detailed survey carried out by consultants into the attitudes of changing Ireland over the past 20 years. A strong, conclusive figure in excess of 70% of those polled, said we should be deeply involved in and fully engaged with Europe and all its activities. The results of that survey were positive for the country. More than 80% of those polled were satisfied with Europe's contribution, which is good from a national viewpoint. Obviously, there have been some difficulties on the European scene, including the rejection of the European Constitution by France and the Netherlands. While elements of the European impression on citizens had a contribution to make to those decisions, other domestic issues were concerned also, which the research showed had a serious bearing on the outcome of those constitutional referenda. The fact that 15 EU countries have already sanctioned the European constitution, either by referenda or parliamentary decision, shows that there is a majority in Europe in favour of how we are progressing.There is no doubt that there are challenges ahead. Ireland's economic success to date, includes the measure of employment and mainstream economic activities here. Foreign direct investment has added to direct jobs through sub-supply sectors that have been able to feed into the situation. These are all benefits stemming from Ireland's membership of the European Union.

He saw the need for changing it and he did so. He called it very quickly. Within three weeks of taking office, he said it would not work. He set about changing it. He brought forward the changes and following the outcome of the European Parliament vote, the European Commission came forward with a revised proposal on the services directive on 4 April last. The proposal was discussed initially at an informal meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 22 April last. It was agreed last Monday and will go before the Council.At the end of the day, the Lisbon Agenda, Ireland's national economic policies and the Government programme are very much at one with regard to equality of opportunity, greater investment across all sectors, ensuring gender balance and mainstream engagement for all of our people, and ensuring we maintain a competitive economy and control inflation. All of that can sustain existing jobs and create more.At present 70% of jobs across Europe come from the services sector. It is crucially important that we are aware of this and do not get left behind, and that we maintain our economic operations in a way that will take full account of the opportunities that this presents for us. We have the capacity as a people, the skills, the educational base and the economic and professional track record to be able to take advantage of these professional services and deliver them to Europe and other parts of the world. We must maintain an economy that will allow us to do this.

Does the Minister of State agree that the following is the basis of that crisis? In every country, particularly France and Germany, where it has come to the fore, there is a perception that the Lisbon Agenda — adopted in 2000, at its mid-term point in 2005 and due to be completed in 2010 — was a text carefully balanced between the two concepts of competitiveness and cohesion. There is dissatisfaction in many European countries with regard to the virtual abandonment of the cohesion element.In the Taoiseach's speech to the Dáil and in the press release from the Department of the Taoiseach on 23 May, the word "competitiveness" occurs several times while the word "cohesion" occurs once. What is the significance of the two elements of cohesion and sustainability? They are regarded in the Taoiseach's text as complementary to the major issue of competitiveness, defined in the revised programme in terms of growth and jobs.Is the Minister of State aware of the grave disappointment among the citizens of Europe at the abandonment of the cohesion element? Does he agree that in the statements made at the mid-term review and those made as late as last week, not a single coherent figure is given for the attainment of any of the cohesion elements, be it leaving school early, differences in income, differences in regard to the housing market and so forth?The stress on competitiveness for inter-regional competition in a global economy is an attempt to deliver to the employers' side cheap labour and is at the same time a comprehensive betrayal of practically every element of cohesion aimed at reducing inequality, and also a betrayal of sustainability, which was aimed at ecological and environmental responsibility with regard to growth. In several countries across Europe, the cause of dissatisfaction is the tearing up of the cohesion element in the Lisbon accord. I say this as one who would support the Lisbon accord because of its balanced text.

Competitiveness and cohesion are linked in that if we do not have one element, we will not have the other.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	147	That is a relative statement. From my 24 years in public life, I believe there has been a huge elimination of poverty. The number of people in poverty who visit me in my office or in my weekly clinics is much lower now than ever before.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The Minister of State is attracting the well-off now.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	149	When I first came into office, poverty was a serious problem. The two serious issues when I entered politics 24 years ago were young people without hope looking for jobs. We were giving them very low——

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	154	Deputy Neville is as usual throwing in a red herring. There are a few people in his city who have a major responsibility in that field for the whole western area, including for Deputy Michael D. Higgins's area and my area. Deputy Neville might have a word with them to tell them they changed the goalposts and changed the games, and that we would like it to go back to the old game to make sure we get equity in the delivery of the resources allocated to us. That is important and a few well-paid people should have a look at that situation.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	155	What is the Minister of State saying about Limerick?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	156	To return to Deputy Higgins's point, it is critically important that we work in a way that takes into account the value, independence, rights and choice of each citizen, that we run a competitive economy and that we take into account not alone the contribution that all citizens can make to developing that economy but also the role they can play in developing social capital. This social capital is traditional to this country, vital to our value system and critical to the economy as an add-on to the delivery of public services by whatever Government is in office. We must mirror that and work to enhance it across the European stage through the Lisbon Agenda to ensure we have a competitive Europe and that we are able to maximise its capacity to grow resources for redistribution across all regions and member states, to take into account the disparities within the regions and provide a greater transfer of resources to bring everybody up to an equal base.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	157	Will the Minister of State offer an opinion as to whether the Lisbon Agenda is travelling in accord with the European project in terms of cohesion and integration? Is the Lisbon Agenda trailing behind or is the European project running ahead? Which is the better of the two? Are they likely to converge or will we have a situation where one runs ahead of the other indefinitely?
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	158	The Minister of State seems to be suffering from a delusion that there are universal, high standard child care facilities throughout the State. Is he aware of the normal cost of child care facilities, which runs at €8,500 per year per child?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	159	That does not arise from this question on the Lisbon Agenda.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	160	It arises directly from the Minister of State's response and from the Lisbon Agenda, which aims to provide these facilities. Is the Minister of State aware that if a parent on the minimum wage has two children, the cost of child care facilities is equal to the total income of the family? Will the Minister of State tell us where the facilities are located or has he provided——

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	163	To respond to Deputy Stagg, I stated that for the first time ever in the delivery of child care services, they were delivered on an equitable basis in urban, rural and provincial Ireland.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	164	The sum of €8,500 is not an equitable basis for those on minimum wage. The Minister of State is misleading the House.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	165	The Deputy did not refer to what I also said. I said that the generosity of Government in successive budgets in delivering to child care has led to inflationary prices in child care services.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	166	It is putting money in the pockets of the speculators who are building these child farms.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I cannot understand that and do not know the reasons for it. Moving on to Deputy Durkan's position, in all fairness we lodged our national reform programme with the European Commission on 28 October 2005. The first year of progress will be reviewed between now and next October which is a short time span. Within the whole European project the Lisbon Agenda is critically important to creating the fiscal, financial and revenue resources necessary for a solid, cohesive Europe where the resources generated can be redistributed and transferred on a equitable basis to the different regions of Europe and the member states who require them, taking into account the different disparities to ensure equity for all and fairness in the system. From a competitor's and a cohesion point of view, the Lisbon Agenda has the economic instruments that will help deliver it into the future.

#JackieHealyRae	unknown-#JackieHealyRae-party	unknown-#JackieHealyRae-dob	unknown-#JackieHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of urgent national importance, namely, the future of the employees of the Great Southern Hotels in Killarney and Parknasilla and also the Kerry area accounts officer placed in the Great Southern Hotel in Killarney. There are seven employees in this office from which all the accounts for the Great Southern Hotels in Killarney and Cork are paid. Are the jobs of those employees safe or will there be job losses? At present the assets and paintings are being taken out of the hotel at Parknasilla and removed by lorry and vehicles. I cannot say where they are being taken to but, as an elected representative from Kerry South, I should know if they are being taken for a drive around the Ring of Kerry or for a walk around the grounds of Parknasilla. I appeal to the Ceann Comhairle, to tell me where they are going and what is being done with them. The Taoiseach examined each one of these paintings and has looked at them over many years.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	172	The Ceann Comhairle will surely allow this matter to be raised.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of urgent national importance, namely, the need for the Tánaiste and the Health Service Executive to outline the reason Mallow General Hospital has been excluded from the list of accident and emergency services and why some patients in the area will be left two hours from appropriate medical treatment due to the absence of a local 24-hour service at Mallow General Hospital. In view of the importance of the issue, I hope the Ceann Comhairle will agree to my request.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of urgent public importance, namely, the Government's shortcomings in the practice of erecting of large replacement mobile phone masts, without planning permission, proliferating additional radiation emitting equipment on such masts, the need for an example of such a new mast erected at Balbriggan Garda station in Fingal, adjacent to houses and a large national school, to be examined under legislation governing planning, health and the prevention of torture, given the sensitivity of some people to such radiation, and the need for amending legislation to be introduced to close any legal loopholes being abused at Balbriggan and elsewhere.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	178	In respect of the Dáil sitting next week, the Tánaiste will be aware of the sequence of events that must take place for legislation to go through. Obviously a Bill comes before the Dáil, must go to the Seanad and must come back to the Dáil for final confirmation. In respect of the matter to come before the Dáil next week, will it be in the form of a Bill to deal immediately with plugging the loophole in the legal system? Is it proposed that the Dáil will sit on Tuesday or Wednesday? If it must go through the Dáil and Seanad and come back to the Dáil, it may be preferable, if the Government is ready, to sit on Tuesday and have it dealt with in order that it can go to the Seanad on Wednesday and come back to the Dáil. Has the Government made a decision on this matter? Will it be a Bill and, if so, will it deal specifically with the priority issue of closing the loophole? What is the position in respect of the sequence of events that must be gone through to have the Bill passed?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	181	We need to know that we are not getting a short Bill that, in typical McDowell fashion, will turn into an octopus as it develops. The urgency has been well enunciated this morning. I suggested to the Tánaiste, and the Labour Party Bill is available to her, that we would seek to legislate on an interim basis to shut off the loophole while the House and the country is having the necessary wider public debate. It is a wider and complex debate. There will be different and quite legitimate views in the House. On the question of young children being exposed and vulnerable——

If the Deputy has a question appropriate to the Order of Business, we will hear it. Otherwise, I will call the Tánaiste to answer Deputy Kenny's question.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	183	The question of young children being left vulnerable to sexual predators is not acceptable to the people and, therefore, we need an interim Bill to shut off the loophole.

Why do we need to have any day off next week? Why cannot we sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and deal with this matter in the way we are elected to do.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	185	That does not arise on the Order of Business. We can have a debate on it when it comes before the Dáil.

There would be little point in meeting without a Bill to pass legislation. The Cabinet is meeting this afternoon and, perhaps, the matter will be clearer when the Whips meet at 7 p.m. on the logistics. I hope we can have agreement from all sides. That would be useful and helpful and I accept what the Deputies opposite have said. The intention is for the Dáil to meet on Wednesday and, if it is necessary also to meet on Thursday, that will happen.

On the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel, this formula of words, which makes a direct reference to Article 94.1 of the Rome Statute, will avoid any conflict arising relating to the length of time for which the postponement may take place and the manner in which it takes place. As the Rome Statute sets out that the postponement must be carried out in consultation with the International Criminal Court, it would be inappropriate to change this provision to a mandatory one as proposed by Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment No. 33. This would interfere with the discretion afforded to the court by the statute.

In page 17, line 39, to delete "a document purporting to be".These amendments are proposed to overcome concerns expressed by Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Costello on the question of proof of documents. The formula proposed in amendments Nos. 37 and 39 deletes the reference in section 20 to "a document purporting to be" regarding a certificate produced by the Minister to the High Court in connection with the issue of an arrest warrant.Subsection (2) has been redrafted to reflect the position that the court has inherent jurisdiction to accept the document purporting to be either a certificate from the Minister or a copy unless there is evidence to the contrary. Amendments Nos. 64 to 66, inclusive, address similar concerns regarding a certificate issued by the Minister relating to whether a state is or not a state party by the statute under section 63(1)(f) and to a certificate that a request is unlikely to be received from the International Criminal Court for the enforcement of an International Criminal Court freezing order as provided for in the new section 38(8)(b)(ii) being inserted by amendment No. 66. I trust this approach meets the concerns of Deputies and, therefore, amendment No. 38 is not required.

This amendment specifies that proceedings for the freezing order shall continue until enforcement or the Minister certifies that it is unlikely that the International Criminal Court shall be seeking enforcement. Amendment No. 49 based on an Opposition amendment on Committee Stage, similar to amendment No. 48, allows for some useful flexibility.

In page 28, line 12, after "time" to insert the following:", having given such notice, if any, as appears to the Court to be appropriate to persons likely to be affected thereby,".Where a court proposes to make an order appointing a receiver it should be required to give notice to the persons likely to be affected. This would not apply where notice would be inappropriate such as where there was an immediate danger of the destruction of the property. Accordingly, all that is required in my suggested amendment is that appropriate notice would be given to parties affected.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	257	This amendment relates to the provisions for discharging a freezing order. The amendment proposes to provide for the High Court to give notice to appropriate persons likely to be affected. The Office of the Attorney General has been consulted on this proposed amendment and its advice is that the amendment is unnecessary. The High Court has inherent discretionary power to give notice, as required, and the advice received is that there is no need to specifically state this. Accordingly, it is not proposed to accept the amendment.

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I am grateful to Deputy Howlin for these amendments.

Accordingly, I propose to accept them.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I move amendment No. 52:
In page 31, line 1, after "order" to insert the following:"which appeared to the High Court to be a sum which might be realised by the person to whom the order is directed".This is an important amendment which relates to the issue of circumstances in which a person may be imprisoned for failure to pay a fine. There are strong international legal prohibitions on the imprisonment of individuals for inability to pay monetary sums.This section is adapted from the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and relates to imprisonment for failure to pay confiscation orders made following conviction for drug trafficking offences. However, the critical feature of the imprisonment system under the Criminal Justice Act is that a confiscation order may be made only for such amount as the court thinks might be realised, in other words, according to the ability of the individual to pay as opposed to the total sum of profit from drug trafficking. For example, where a person makes a profit of €10,000 from trafficking drugs but spends €5,000 of it on feeding his or her own habit, the remaining €5,000 is the realisable sum, in other words, under the Criminal Justice Act a person is not liable to be imprisoned for failure to comply with a confiscation order in circumstances where he or she is palpably unable to comply with the order because the money or resources are not available to him or her. For that reason, under the Criminal Justice Act there should be no question of imprisonment for simple inability to pay where that is clear to the court.This safeguard is conspicuous by its absence from section 39. Under the section, particularly under section 39(9), the High Court is empowered to order a person to pay the full amount of the ICC order, with the person facing imprisonment for up to ten years where he or she is in default of that order. This is a worrying principle and, according to the advices available to me, may be constitutionally infirm — we have enough experience of constitutional infirmity in recent times. Accordingly, I suggest the insertion of a qualifier that the amount must be one the court considers is realisable.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	265	This amendment seeks to insert additional wording in section 40(9). Subsection (9) provides that if at any time after the making of the enforcement order it is reported to the High Court that any sum payable under the ICC order remains unpaid, the court may order the person to whom the ICC order relates be imprisoned. The amendment proposes that this provision will only apply in cases of sums payable under the ICC order which appeared to the High Court to be a sum which might be realised by the person to whom the order is directed.This amendment is unnecessary. No court will imprison a person if he or she cannot realise his or her assets. Subsection (10) provides that no order under subsection (9) shall be made until the person to whom the ICC order relates has been given a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the court. Therefore, the person can outline to the court any factors that affected his or her payment in compliance with the ICC order. Subsection (9) is modelled on section 19(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 which deals with the general enforcement of confiscation orders. The existing wording is sufficiently flexible and I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	266	That is most surprising and unfortunate. The Minister of State stated that the court would have to do what I, in my amendment, ask that it should do. If that is the Minister's intent, why can we not be explicit in making it the intent?The following simple wording is what I want to insert: "which appeared to the High Court to be a sum which might be realised by the person to whom the order is directed". For the sake of clarity, there is no difficulty in the Oireachtas laying out that as a condition of imprisonment. I am not sure the Minister of State was correct in stating what would be automatically the case. Unfortunately, there are too many people already in the prison system for the non-payment of monetary fines, but that is a separate argument.The amendment is a worthy one. The Minister of State has accepted the principle of it and I have no idea why he will not accept the substance of it.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	267	As I stated, subsection (10) provides that the person to whom the order relates be given a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the court and, therefore, can outline any factors which would affect his or her payment in compliance with the order. We are quite adamant that we will not accept this amendment. It is unnecessary.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Although I do not know whether the Minister of State has ever been in the courts, one does not need a statutory provision to state that citizens of the State can make representations to the court because it is a constitutional right. There are no bonus points available for stating that under subsection (10) persons must be given a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the court; there is a constitutional right to do so.What I am saying is quite different, that where there is a danger of imprisonment the courts, under this enactment, must be able to determine that the person is in a position to pay the monetary fine or realise the asset sought by the court. The provision that the Minister of State suggests is quite separate and extraneous to that argument. I do not see why the principle, if he has accepted it, should not be captured in the Bill.

In addition, there is no provision for the return of other material that may be seized within the State. Having considered the matter, we believe that some provision in this regard is appropriate and should be part of the legislation to comply with common decency.

If no provision is made for material to be returned it could impact on future cases because the Bill specifies that the ICC would take precedence over cases in this State but if its case were to fail it would still allow the State to proceed with another charge. However, if the material sent to The Hague is not returned when its case is concluded, this could endanger any future prosecution in Ireland.It is important that material is returned but it is also important that the bodies of loved ones are respected and that they would be reinterred as quickly as possible to ensure the minimum grief is caused to their families at such a time. The amendment is worthwhile as it puts that extra duty on the State to ensure we would get back all evidence supplied to the ICC so that our legal system can have all the evidence at its disposal.

Section 51 deals with locating people and identifying or locating property. Subsection (13) deals with the transmission of documentation to the ICC and provides for the transmission to the ICC of any material obtained under this section in accordance with the directions of the Minister etc.The Minister had agreed to consider this on the basis of replacing "shall" with "may" in the first line. However, having consulted the parliamentary counsel, he is satisfied that such an amendment is neither desirable nor necessary and that the provisions of section 51(2)(b) are sufficient to cover the circumstances envisaged by the proposed amendment. Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I think the Minister would believe that the insertion I propose is much more comprehensive. It is also much more respectful, particularly in terms of human remains and is sensitive to the wishes of the loved ones of individuals. I do not think we should leave it as a discretionary issue. It should be clear and should be set out in a respectful way in legislation. These are sensitive matters and are not discretionary, to be left to the whim of the Minister of the day.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	280	The current wording gives the Minister flexibility as to the conditions he wishes to attach to the transmission of evidence to the ICC. The Minister may well require the return of such material following the conclusion of proceedings before the ICC. However, there may also be cases where there is no occasion to require the return of the material and the subsection provides that flexibility. In contrast, the Deputy's amendment would require the return of all material regardless of whether we wanted it back.The issue of human remains is a very sensitive one and I fully agree that the feelings and requirements of the next of kin should be respected at all times. There can be no question but that the State would act honourably in such cases and would arrange for the reburial of the remains as required. However, I think it is very unlikely that human remains would ever be transmitted to the ICC from the State. The autopsy on the remains would take place in the State and if the ICC needed any further examination of the remains it is far more likely that it would send experts over to the State rather than request that the remains be sent to The Hague.While I have no objection to the principle behind the amendment, the current wording of the subsection provides the necessary flexibility. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I am surprised and disappointed that the Minister is taking a dogmatic line on this. What he is saying is that the State will act responsibly, simpliciter. That is all well and good, but we are here to make sure we set out in law the duties and responsibilities of the State. If the simple view were true that all Ministers would carry out their duties responsibly and well, we would not get into half the messes we get into.We need to lay out the framework in which we believe proper conduct is captured. Certainly, in regard to human remains, there may well be rare circumstances where serious criminal charges are being heard and forensic materials may well be required for a contested case, rather than simply the pathology report. We have to make provision for these matters. That is what a broad-seeing legislature does. I am disappointed the Minister feels it is good enough to simply say we should leave it to the Minister and the State, that future Governments will act responsibly in all circumstances and that we do not need to set out what are decent standards in primary legislation.

In page 42, line 5, after "oath" to insert "or affirmation".This is a standard provision that is not adequately covered by the Interpretation Act 1937. I want to make this clear before the Minister of State tells me it is covered. Many statutes provide expressly for the possibility of oath or affirmation, a classic example being the Tribunal of Inquiries Act, which is still the fundamental law relating to tribunals in the State. It is the norm to insert "oath" or "affirmation" in Bills. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment rather than say that it is covered by some catch-all enactment elsewhere.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I am hardly needed at this stage. This amendment proposes to insert "affirmation" after "oath" in subparagraph (i) of subsection (3)(a) of section 52. Subsection (3)(a) provides inter alia that the judge in the taking of evidence has various powers, including the power to take evidence on oath. Amendment No. 57 proposes to extend the power to take evidence on oath or affirmation. I am advised that the Schedule to the Interpretation Act 2005 covers the matter and defines the word “oath” to allow a person to affirm instead of swearing an oath. Therefore, the word “oath” in legislation encompasses an affirmation. Accordingly, the proposed amendment is unnecessary.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	286	This is a small but important matter. It was once argued in this House that it was understood that the word "man" encompassed women as well as men and that, therefore, it was not necessary to include the word "woman". Such an argument would not be accepted today. We now live in a different society in which not everyone swears on oath. In the same way as we use "he or she", it should be normal parlance to use "oath or affirmation". This is the nature of the new society in which we live. The notion that affirmation is captured by the word "oath" is not acceptable to many people. I ask the Minister of State to reflect on this and possibly make an executive decision to accept this amendment because it does not damage the Bill.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The spectacle of Ministers simply following instructions to read out a prepared script and not making decisions is becoming tedious. Although the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has many weaknesses, he listens to alternative viewpoints and changes his mind when such viewpoints are reasonable. It is pointless dealing with the Minister of State if he is not prepared to listen to alternative viewpoints. It is not a good way to make law and wastes the time of the House. We might as well rubber-stamp the Bill without bothering to move amendments.

In page 46, line 42, after "detention" to insert the following:", and whether such orders were made by the Court before or after it commenced sitting in the State".This amendment is designed to deal with a situation where the entire trial does not take place within the State but some order is made outside the State in respect of a trial, part of which takes place within the State. Clearly, an order made outside the State by the ICC should be accepted as valid within the State. This amendment aims to achieve clarity in this regard.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Section 58 provides for sittings in the State of the ICC and subsection (2) stipulates that orders made by the ICC while sitting in the State will have the same effect as though the orders were made by the Central Criminal Court. The proposed amendment seeks to broaden the scope of subsection (2) by providing that orders made by the ICC before or after sitting in the State will also have effect as if they were orders made by the Central Criminal Court.This proposal would seem to give orders of the ICC direct application in this country, with uncertain results. The suggested new material is being added after "detention" in line 42 of page 46, but before the closing bracket. Thus, it appears that orders for imprisonment or detention made by the ICC before or after sitting in the State would have direct effect in the State.As requests made by the ICC for the arrest of persons will be processed in accordance with the provisions of Part 3 of the Bill, this proposal is unnecessary. Under the provisions of Part 3, only the High Court can issue a warrant for the arrest of a person. In addition, the proposed amendment seems to go beyond the intent of the Rome Statute and the related Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court. The Rome Statute, in article 4, provides for the exercise of the functions and powers of the ICC on the territory of a state party. The agreement in article 12 provides that where the ICC exercises its functions outside its headquarters in The Hague, it may conclude with the state concerned an arrangement concerning the provision for the appropriate facilities for the exercise of its functions. I cannot accept the proposal to give the ICC orders for imprisonment or detention direct effect in the State and, accordingly, it is not proposed to accept the amendment.

In page 47, line 29, to delete "a state party to the Statute" and substitute "the State or another state".It appears that in amendment No. 63, the Minister of State is accepting the point I am making so I will not waste time discussing it. The section provides that any country which has signed up to the statute of the ICC cannot claim diplomatic or state immunity. However, this seems to acknowledge that any country which refuses to sign up to the statute can continue to claim such immunity. This would seem to be an inappropriate admission which would only benefit countries which seek to undermine the functioning of the ICC, to which this country is party and to which this legislation binds us and transposes into our domestic law. The general provision proposed by me changes this, while the Minister of State's amendment appears to do likewise. I hope he will confirm that this is the intention of amendment No. 63 and the consequential amendment No. 62.

I acknowledge how busy some of the Deputies have been with a number of current issues.The Bill will give effect to the statute of the International Criminal Court, which entered into force on 1 July 2002. The statute provides for the establishment of an International Criminal Court with jurisdiction to investigate, prosecute and punish persons who commit the most serious offences of concern to the international community, namely, genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.The Bill enables Ireland to fulfil the obligation under the statute to prosecute these offences domestically and provide assistance to the court in the investigation and prosecution of cases taken by the court. The Bill creates new offences of war crimes and crimes against humanity and consolidates the existing offence of genocide under the Genocide Act 1973. It will allow the State to assist the court through providing accelerated mechanisms for the arrest and surrender of persons wanted in connection with an ICC offence, dealing with requests for the freezing and confiscation of property and providing evidence during the investigation. I thank Deputies for their co-operation in dealing with the Bill.

We want to ensure the money that comes into the Government's possession as a result of a decision of residents of nursing homes or their families not to take up the refund due to them is earmarked for specific projects and not lost in the general finances of the Department of Health and Children. We are asking that under no circumstances shall funds or any money donated be used in lieu of expenditure that would otherwise have been allocated by the Minister in his normal function and that such money be ring-fenced for projects of benefit to the elderly involved, such as community care units and other necessary facilities that are currently lacking. Such projects would lengthen the time some elderly people would remain outside nursing homes, private or public.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Deputy Twomey raised this on Committee Stage and amendment No. 9 will deal with a number of the issues raised about the donations fund.This amendment will allow for the fund to be established and managed by the Health Service Executive. The fund will be also be able to receive donations of property and the proceeds of any dispersal shall be placed in it. The HSE will be able to invest the money in the fund but only in institutions that have been authorised by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The fund will be monitored and audited to ensure the money in the account will be used appropriately and for what it was intended. Reports on the operation of the fund will be made to the Minister and these reports will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.Any money that is donated to this fund will not be subject to capital acquisitions tax liability and the individual making a donation to the fund can specify how he would like that money to be applied within the health services. The HSE will have regard to the wishes of the person making the donation to the fund but, due to practical and administrative difficulties, it cannot provide assurances that the money will be used for the specific institution requested. It can, however, provide assurances that the money will only be used for service improvements in the area of older people or the disability sector.The HSE has provided initial indications of how it is proposed to administer the fund and any fund allocation decision by the HSE will, as far as possible, assign funds as close as possible to the service and unit that was the source of the funds and it is intended to specify this on the application form.It is envisaged that the fund will be administered by the HSE, which will include managing and assigning money and accounting for and reporting on the fund. If it is not practical to assign funds to a specific unit, funding should be ring-fenced for the same service in the same area. The HSE intends as soon as possible to establish a working group incorporating representatives of the service areas and the finance unit to agree the criteria for selecting the service improvements that will benefit from the disbursement of the fund.Any further issues around the administration of the donation fund can be addressed by way of secondary legislation. Section 21 of the Bill also allows the Minister to deal with any emerging difficulties in the scheme.The fund will be separate from money from the Department of Finance and from the annual expenditure in the Department of Health and Children. It will be used specifically for services for older people or those with disabilities.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	342	The thrust of the Minister's reply covers the objectives of amendment No. 10. Under those circumstances I will not move the amendment. We are pleased there will be an opportunity to discuss this when it is laid before the Dáil each year. It introduces a level of transparency that will meet our concerns about the transfer of funds being used to meet the normal expenditure accruing from the Department of Finance to the Department of Health and Children.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 6, line 2, to delete "including" and substitute "being".This bone of contention for the Labour Party was raised on Second and Committee Stages. Bringing in outside consultants to operate this system cannot be justified. Why is this being proposed? It will lead to additional costs with no guarantee that the system will be better or more efficient. We have some of the best personnel in the public sector. They are very competent and have proved in the past that they can deal with emergency payments. In the Department of Social and Family Affairs, for example, personnel organise the making of payments on a weekly basis. One of the great cries from the general public, who are weary of this Government, concerns the number of consultants and outside bodies every Minister and Department engages to produce reports and get work done which can be done by people in the Departments. We have confidence that they will do as good a job, if not better, than the outside grouping referred to by the Minister of State that will carry out this function, which also will place an additional cost on to the State.We ask the Minister to accept the point made. I do not expect him to turn, however, because he has not acceded to our request on different Stages of the Bill. We ask him to delete "including" and substitute "being".
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I support the Labour Party amendment. Since 1997, 175 reports have been submitted to the Department of Health and Children in respect of its work. There is a proliferation of reports and a lack of activity on sorting out the difficulties in our health service. This legislation will mean there will be another involvement of consultants. Surely the health service in particular or the public service in general have the necessary expertise. We have had some excellent performances and services from other Departments, including the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which deals with a complex area but is efficient in the way it carries out its work across a range of payments, regulations and appeals. Surely that level of experience, not alone in the Department of Social and Family Affairs but in other Departments like the Department of Agriculture and Food, which deals with complex issues concerning payments from the European Union with detailed regulations, many of which are difficult even to read let alone implement, can be called on by the Department of Health and Children. If that expertise, coupled with its own expertise, is available there is no need to spend vast amounts of money on external consultants to carry out what in effect is repayment of moneys the criteria for which will be clear and transparent. Surely that scheme can be operated by the public service rather than having to again engage expensive external consultants.We hear about ongoing discussions on increasing the number of staff in the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive. We hear also of the expertise that was available to each of the health boards, now concentrated in the Health Service Executive, but the management of seven health boards is now reduced to the management of one Health Service Executive. The expertise and professionalism of the people who have become available as a result of the rationalisation of the health boards could be applied to distributing funds, the criteria for which will be clear and transparent.

I concur with the argument he presented in this case. In trying to tease this out with the Minister of State, is he able to advise us as to his Department's assessment of the number of people it would require to oversee and conduct the processing of applications and the follow through work the whole procedure would entail? Do we know if that has been assessed? Can he tell us why it is believed it is not within the compass of the HSE or the Department to administer the scheme if that was an option? Has there already been an exploration of outside bodies to determine interest and availability of players from within the private sector? Can the Minister advise if any such explorative exercise has been employed?I recall the various figures we all cited on Committee Stage and the Minister's information shared with us. Can he tell us the up to date position on the numbers of people who have come forward and registered their expected entitlement to repayment? Has there been any revision of the figures cited heretofore on the expected total number of applicants who will present? From my notes I see it was suggested that repayments would be due to some 20,000 people who are still alive and that a further 40,000 to 50,000 — these are significant, ballpark type figures; the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 is not small — would be a "guesstimate" of the estates that would benefit. Has there been any further revisitation of those figures and can the Minister share with us the up to date information? Is there a greater exactitude regarding same?There is not only a principle involved here but this scheme will be a significant charge on the Exchequer in the first instance in terms of ensuring the repayment of moneys taken illegally from residents in long-term residential care institutions. The added cost of engaging private sector handlers and the overseeing of the repayments scheme will add additional cost, which one presumes will come out of the overall health budget. There is, therefore, genuine and well-founded concern on the part of Members that this would be wasteful and should be avoided. We would like to hear the Minister of State's arguments on why the Bill leaves this open to applicants in the private sector. I believe the simple mechanism presented by Deputy Seán Ryan and his Labour Party colleagues of substituting the word "including" for "being" achieves the required result. I commend the amendment and await the Minister of State's response to the various points we have raised.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	346	The Deputies have raised a number of issues with which I will try to deal. I cannot accept the amendment as it would not allow for the appointment of an outside company to administer the scheme.The Government decision allowed for the appointment of an outside company to provide an independent input into the process. The current public tendering process is at a very advanced stage. It is expected that a decision on the appointment of a preferred service provider will be made when the board of the Health Service Executive meets on 1 June.The outside company will provide an independent input into the administration of the scheme and will also have the necessary experience given the magnitude of the repayments involved. Those applying for repayment may not have been satisfied if the Health Service Executive had been assigned responsibility to calculate the amount of repayments due because the former health boards had applied charges in the first instance.The company will help to reassure the public that the scheme is being operated in the most effective and equitable way possible. The HSE has informed my Department that it is satisfied the company recommended for selection is the most economically advantageous option and that the costs will be significantly less than those quoted in the first tendering process, which was halted in December last year.The HSE has also stated its support on the decision to engage an outside company because it is not in a position to administer the scheme itself. The making of repayments on this scale is not core work and, given its extensive commitments to the provision of health services, the resources required to administer the scheme are not available within the HSE without diverting staff from normal duties. We are not making this up or stating it within the Department. The HSE has itself stated this. The notion has been put around that since the health services were reformed, there are hundreds or thousands of people twiddling their thumbs looking for other jobs. These people all have serious jobs to do.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	347	That includes the Minister.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	348	This is not the type of job which the HSE has the necessary expertise to do.Consideration was given by the HSE to the involvement of public sector staff to assist the executive in administering the scheme, but the HSE has indicated that this approach was not taken due to a number of factors. These included potential industrial relations difficulties, the requirement to assign dedicated HSE resources to supervise these staff and remove them from normal duties, the time constraints of the public procurement process and the potential for significant logistical difficulties and protracted delays which would have to be factored into the tendering process if the staff were to be taken on board.This is the largest repayment scheme ever undertaken in the State. The State has been found by the Supreme Court to have been wrong——
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	349	Negligent.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Yes. Not that we take any comfort from the Supreme Court finding that something was done which should not have been, but the practice was accepted by successive Governments and the majority of the people involved. They felt they were getting good value for the care given. That aside and following the Supreme Court decision, we have a responsibility which we have acted on. By appointing an outside company, a certain credibility is lent to the process. The people need have no doubt that the process will be carried out in a fair manner.Deputy Ó Caoláin raised some questions. We expect the claims of those living to be somewhere between 16,000 and 20,000. With the previous legislation there was an ex gratia payment of up to €2,000. Just under 11,000 people were paid under that scheme. At the moment we have in the region of 22,000 applications for repayments. That would include both living people and estates. It is estimated that between 40,000 and 50,000 estates could be entitled to repayments. With regard to required manpower, the HSE has indicated that it would require approximately 100 people over a period of two years to deal with the claims.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	351	As I stated earlier, I did not expect the Minister of State to change his approach at this stage. If the will had been there, it could have been dealt with. It is ideologically driven and it is a vote of no confidence in the departmental staff and the public sector. I am not stating the Department of Health and Children would be the prime mover in this regard, but the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, generally goes to the private sector to deal with an issue. That is incorporated in this legislation.I have no indication from the Minister of State of the basic cost. What is the projected cost of operating this scheme? Is there any indication what this may be? It may be premature to ask that now. We can get that response. It is a fundamental issue and I regret that the Minister of State is not prepared to accept this amendment.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.As the Deputies are aware, on 1 February 2006 I appointed Mr. Tim Dalton, former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to carry out an investigation into issues relating to corporate management in Bord na gCon as well as the management of positive tests for banned substances. I received Mr. Dalton's draft report last month and my Department immediately sought guidance from the Office of the Attorney General on how to proceed with the issues raised in his report.In accordance with the advice of the Attorney General, copies and, in some cases, extracts of the Dalton report have been sent to persons referred to in the report on a confidential basis to afford them an opportunity to submit observations on the report to me by the close of business today. Any comments received will then be made available to Mr. Dalton for the purposes of finalising his report, following which I will present proposals to my Cabinet colleagues for dealing with the recommendations made in the Dalton report. I will also seek approval for immediate publication of the report.I regret that my requests to the various parties to refrain from comment on the subject matter of the report until due process has been completed have not been respected. I do not intend to comment at this stage on any aspect of Mr. Dalton's report until the report itself is formally in the public domain as it would be entirely inappropriate for me to do so. I will deal fully with these issues as soon as I am in a position to do so.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	353	In a reply to a similar question on the previous occasion he was before the House, the Minister indicated that all parties involved in the investigation would be granted due process. In light of the selected leaking of documents associated with this case, have people received due process? In January, for example, a letter sent to the Minister by the chief executive of Bord na gCon was leaked to RTE and a number of television and radio programmes dealt with the document. Two weeks ago, before the persons named in the Dalton report even received a copy of it, The Sunday Tribune and Sunday Independent published lead articles featuring leaked details of the recommendations and findings of the report. Does this constitute due process? Does the Minister agree that the leaks have been highly selective in that they have been targeted at the chairman of Bord na gCon? I will withhold my judgment on the chairman until I receive a copy of the report which will also be discussed in the House. Surely it is not due process when one person, a busy businessman who gave ten years of his life to Bord na gCon and from which he took no fees, should be singled out and targeted in this manner. This is clearly unfair.This is not the first leak from a Government which appears to run its affairs through a series of leaks. Last week, when the Fine Gael Party submitted a Private Members' Bill to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it was immediately leaked to the media by the Minister or one of his officials. Surely this is not the correct approach. I ask the Minister to respond to my questions on due process and the treatment of the chairman of Bord na gCon.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I deeply regret the fact that extracts from the Dalton report were published in some newspapers. I assure the House that neither I nor any officials in my Department were involved in any of the leaks concerned, which I deplore. While it is not for me to make a judgment as to the nature of the leaks, inasmuch as I requested people to desist from commenting on the contents of the report, I also deplore the fact that parts of it were leaked.Having said that, I acknowledge the work of officials in my Department with whom I have had the privilege of working for four years. They are people of the highest integrity. There is no need for me to act as an apologist for them as their work speaks for itself. I was involved with them in the renewal of the horse and greyhound racing fund when we increased it to a total of €550 million until the end of 2008. Given that the greyhound industry is entitled to one fifth of this amount, it will be clear that my commitment and that of officials in my Department to the greyhound industry has been proven in tangible form.I repeat that I regret that leaks took place and people sought to comment prior to due process being completed. If the advice I issued at the outset of this process had been adhered to, we would all be in a much better position today.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The Minister received a copy of the report on 5 April. Does he agree that the subsequent delay in publishing it has allowed a farce to be created and diminished the standing of everyone concerned, including the Minister who has failed to take action on this matter, which must be brought to a conclusion? Will no action be taken on foot of the Dalton report before the summer recess? I understand morale among Bord na gCon is low because nothing has been done. Members of the public wonder if something is being hidden because the report has not been published.This issue has also been surrounded by a series of leaks and interviews. I am informed that nearly every member of the press has a copy of the report, although Deputy Deenihan and I have not yet received a copy. The episode has degenerated into a farce. The Minister must make decisions and inform the House when action will be taken on foot of the report to allow us to move on. A growing number of people benefit from the greyhound industry which attracts large numbers of people to tracks and has created many new greyhound owners. It is wrong that no markers have been put down following the report. Will the Minister give the House a date on which action will be taken? The importance of the greyhound industry cannot be overstated.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	356	There is no farce from my point of view. The situation is quite straightforward — I requested people to observe due process. As I have said before, neither I nor my officials leaked the report and we were not responsible for it. I have also said on several occasions that, irrespective of what anybody said, we would observe due process. There was no point in setting out on that road a couple of months ago and coming along now saying we would terminate that process and make decisions on the hoof. I will not do it. In recent weeks, people have been given the opportunity to express their views on the report. It is only right and proper that this should occur. They have until the end of business today to make their observations.In the intervening period, I have also taken the opportunity to appoint two new members to Bord na gCon. I wrote to thank Mr. John Hegarty and Mr. Cathal Curley for their services to the board over three and nine years respectively. I decided that it was opportune at this point to appoint two new members to the board: Mr. Séamus Mallon, the former MP, representing Northern interests; and Mr. Dick O'Sullivan, who has made an enormous contribution as the manager of Punchestown, in Mr. Hegarty's place. These are two good appointments. I again thank the outgoing members, while wishing the new members well.

This flies in the face of Government policy concerning gender balance on such boards. It is inexplicable why the Minister has not made such an appointment.Does the Minister agree that the chairman of Bord na gCon had no option but to publicly defend his name, reputation and integrity because of leaks to the media in order to personalise this affair and in some way damage him as well? All of this refers back to the use of prohibited substances, EPO in this case. Before I left office in 1997, I had prepared a Bill to take control out of the hands of the board so that in this instance, the chairman of the board would not preside over this type of case. It was not carried forward by the Government at that time. Despite what the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, said about the Supreme Court case, on numerous occasions in the House since then I have raised the issue of control and the fact that it should be taken from the board. Would the Minister accept my proposed private Members' Bill at this time as an immediate solution to this problem when we discuss the report here?Will the Minister make the observations available to us when we discuss the matter in the House? In that way, not alone will we discuss the Dalton report but also the observations of the various persons affected by that report. That would only be fair to Deputy Wall and me so we can be well informed when we have the debate in this House.

Clearly, that forms part of the report and I anticipate that we will have a discussion on it. With regard to the question of statements made by various parties, I do not think I would have any difficulty — subject to the Attorney General's approval, which would have to come — with these statements being annexed to Mr. Dalton's report, which must be polished or finalised in the context of the documents coming forward.As regards whether the outgoing chairman had any choice, let me preface my remarks by saying that I have acknowledged——

In that respect, Deputy Deenihan seeks to suggest that Mr. Taggart had no choice. I would remind Deputy Deenihan that when I called for due process in the first instance, there was no report in existence and segments of a report were not leaked. Nonetheless, the chairman decided that he had to make a public comment, even though I did say it was necessary for all parties to observe due process. It is important to make that point.

A new senior management position of director of regional development is expected to be filled shortly and a due diligence process with each of the regional tourism authorities is almost complete. Fáilte Ireland has advised me that it expects that the changes will be implemented by the end of the summer.CSO statistics for overseas tourism for 2005 show a positive result both in terms of overseas numbers — up 6% or 400,000 additional visitors, to almost 7 million — and revenue earnings up almost 8% to €3.455 billion, excluding carrier receipts and cross Border tourism. On both counts, we are ahead of targets for the year.As global competition intensifies and consumer preferences evolve, these results represent a robust performance by the sector and confirm how dynamic and responsive the Irish tourism sector is.It is widely acknowledged within the tourism sector that growing the pure holiday component of the overseas tourism business has proven difficult in recent years, both at a regional and national level. In 2005, the holiday segment of all overseas travel to Ireland grew by 2.7% in revenue terms, significantly lower than the 8% overall revenue earnings growth. This clearly impacts on the holiday business at a regional level. Both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland are working to help the industry to address the issues behind this trend, which is very much a global phenomenon.It is also important to emphasise that the visiting friends or relatives or VFR component of the overall tourism business continues to be of immense strategic importance. It grew by more than 17% in revenue terms in 2005.The home holiday market is an increasingly important component of the tourism business in Ireland, particularly in terms of seasonal and regional spread. Some 86% of holiday trips and 89% of holiday nights by domestic tourists are now spent outside the Dublin area. This offsets, to some extent, the relative strength of Dublin in the overseas visitors market. In 2005, expenditure on domestic tourism was up across all regions, albeit at different rates.The fact that all regions and sectors are not benefiting to the same extent from our tourism success continues to be a matter receiving attention from my Department and the State tourism agencies as we evolve our tourism policy and programmes. I am confident, however, that the new regional tourism arrangements, with enhanced functions being put in place at local level, will help tourism to grow in the regions to a greater extent than at present. The various region-specific initiatives introduced this year by Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland Ltd. will further help to address this situation.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	371	How will these new arrangements help to stop the obvious east-west tourism divide in this country? How will the new arrangements, which are really scrapping RTAs, help the ailing bed and breakfast industry? Traditional bed and breakfast establishments, which were hitherto the pillar of rural tourism, are now closing right across the country every day. How will the new arrangements bring back the growth of activity holidays here? We have been losing market share in areas such as golf, hill-walking, angling, equestrian sports and cruising to Scotland, Wales, England and continental Europe. How will these new arrangements — the breaking up and scrapping, more or less, of the RTAs — help stem the difference between east and west and the other factors to which I referred?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	372	The enhancement of the powers of the RTAs should not be considered in isolation. It is the case that enhanced powers will be given to the RTAs in terms of marketing and product development. However, it is also important to realise that we have broken up the country into three regions for the purposes of marketing to improve regional spread — the regions are south, east and west. The idea is to emphasise not just the urban advantages but the advantages of the rural hinterlands. The local marketing initiative, which will provide funds to local marketing groups to enable them to market, should also be taken into account. In addition, there is an innovation fund which will help to build up the product in specific regions where innovative proposals come forward. Region-specific marketing campaigns are continuing on the Continent, in Britain and further afield.I am pleased that we had a record number of visitors — 6.9 million — to Ireland last year. The initiatives we have undertaken will help to spread more visitors to the regions. There is an opportunity, in particular with regard to outdoor activities such as golf, through the Ryder Cup, to market Ireland's countryside to a greater extent than ever before.Deputy Deenihan is correct that there is a difficulty with regard to bed and breakfast accommodation. There is a far greater number of hotel rooms and hotels in Ireland today than ten years ago. Many of the hotels can be relatively competitive when compared to bed and breakfast accommodation, which causes difficulty for the latter. It is also correct to suggest that the demographics of bed and breakfast accommodation are causing concern in the sense that younger couples are not as inclined to stay in them as was the case, perhaps because both partners or the husband and wife work outside the home.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	373	Does the Minister agree there is concern that confusion will arise when the PWC report is put in place in the coming weeks? Five RTAs will be diluted and scrapped. Two RTAs, those of Dublin and Shannon, and three super-regions, as the Minister refers to them, will remain to market Ireland. There will be total confusion.Will the Minister state how pure holiday tourism will be promoted in the regions? Pure holiday tourism, as the Minister more or less indicated, is on the decline in all regions outside Dublin whereas it is on the increase in Dublin.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	374	The PWC report makes clear that six new regional tourism partnerships, RTPs, should be established and that each of the RTPs will include regionally based industry representatives, city and country borough managers, local authority representatives and Fáilte Ireland nominees. The chairperson of each RTP will be nominated from within the partnership and will have relevant commercial experience, and these chairpersons will become members of a regional tourism council, which will also include nominees from ITIC, Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland. There is a great degree of integration.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I am aware of the wish of the Gaelic Athletic Association to develop a multi-annual programme for the refurbishment and redevelopment of major GAA venues. I am very much in favour of such a development and would point out to the Deputy that it has been practice over recent years to make provision in the annual sports capital programme allocations for grant support for a number of major GAA grounds. I intend to continue in this mode.In the processing of the applications received annually under the sports capital programme all applications received from the county GAA boards for the refurbishment or redevelopment of their county grounds are forwarded to the GAA for its views on the strategic importance of the applications. Following its own internal consultative process, the GAA identifies its priorities and, having regard for this prioritisation and the levels of available funding, I make allocations in respect of selected projects.Since 1998, a total of €14.43 million has been allocated towards the refurbishment and redevelopment of 24 GAA county grounds. Among the projects which have been supported are Pearse Stadium in Galway, the Gaelic Grounds in Limerick, Markievicz Park in Sligo, O'Moore Park in Portlaoise, O'Connor Park in Tullamore, Hyde Park in Roscommon, Páirc Mac Diarmada in Carrick-on-Shannon and St. Conleth's Park in Newbridge. Since 1998 almost €134 million has been allocated towards GAA projects at local and regional level, which represents some 35% of the total allocation made under the programme. This funding is in addition to the funding of €103.5 million allocated over the same period towards the redevelopment of Croke Park into one of Europe's finest sports stadiums.As recently as 16 May last, I and my officials met the president of the GAA and his officials. At this meeting, inter alia, the issue of the provision of funding in respect of strategic provincial facilities and county grounds was discussed. I understand the GAA has established a national infrastructural and safety committee which will undertake a review of its venues with a view to the formulation of a new strategy for the development of GAA facilities at regional and local level. I have indicated that I would be happy to consider any requests for funding from the GAA which it may wish to make arising from that review.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I welcome the Minister's statement on the GAA grounds. He might want to check the record to ascertain whether St. Conleth's Park was included. Although it was not the Minister's fault, I understand it was not included and that the funding was not drawn down on that occasion.The thinking behind this question relates to the major demand for funding at Semple Stadium and Fitzgerald Stadium. Both stadia are entrenched in GAA folklore and, apart from Croke Park, are the two most famous stadia in the country. The estimated cost of a refurbishment of Semple Stadium is €18 million. It is difficult to foresee the GAA, the Tipperary County Board or the Munster Council being able to raise that amount. With that in mind, I put down this question to discover the Minister's position in regard to the two stadia, given their importance in the history of the GAA. In latter years, we have seen all-Ireland finals played in Thurles when they had always previously been played in Croke Park.I accept the Minister's position on proposals yet to be put to him by the GAA. Will the Minister and his Department look beyond the position that operated heretofore with regard to grounds? No other grounds will demand as much funding for development as Semple Stadium and Fitzgerald Stadium, and €18 million was not invested in any other county ground, by a long shot. Given their importance to the structure of the GAA, will the Government, through the Minister and his Department, look favourably on applications for Semple Stadium and Fitzgerald Stadium?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The stadium I discussed with the GAA authorities is Semple Stadium — I discussed it with the officials of the Munster Council when we met. I do not think anybody has an understanding of Irish culture unless he or she has stood on the terrace at Semple Stadium on the day of a Munster hurling final. Therefore, the Deputy can take it that I empathise and sympathise with the cause he espouses.The GAA appears to have come to the conclusion, which I welcome, that Semple Stadium should be the second stadium of the GAA in the country. In those circumstances, it will receive the recognition which the conferring on it of such a status would require.With regard to St. Conleth's Park in Kildare, in which Deputy Wall will be particularly interested, in 1999 a grant of €253,948 was sanctioned for that ground. This was followed in 2005 with a grant of €200,000. I do not know whether that sum was drawn down — I accept it probably was not. However, the grant is still in existence. I look forward to the day when it is drawn down.

In January 2006, the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company, LRSDC, the company charged with delivery of the project, submitted a planning application to Dublin City Council. Before doing so, the company engaged in an extensive period of consultations with local groups and has endeavoured to address to the maximum extent possible concerns expressed by these groups.As would be expected in a project of this size and nature, a number of submissions were made to the planning authorities, including objections lodged by a number of local residents groups and individual residents. The planning authority has sought further information from the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company on a number of aspects of the proposed development.The Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company is preparing a comprehensive response to the request from Dublin City Council for further information and expects to submit its response this week. Officials of my Department have been briefed by the development company on the planning issues and I have been assured that every effort is being made to address all the issues raised to the fullest extent.It is not possible to estimate the length of time that will be required to complete the planning process. Up to the present, the project has proceeded on schedule and I hope the planning process will not delay that schedule.With regard to the dispute between the IRFU and the named rugby football club, this is a matter between the IRFU and the club in question. It is clear that ultimately the issues must be resolved by the parties directly involved and I do not intend to intervene in this matter. Discussions between these parties are still ongoing and I am confident that a solution will be found and the dispute will not delay the redevelopment of the stadium.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Recently I visited one the of the residents groups in respect of its objections to the proposal. I thank the Minister for information on liaising with the residents group with a view to overcoming its problems. Obviously it will not be possible to overcome the concerns of residents if the development proceeds because the stadium will overlook the houses and nothing can change that. Given that there are 150 objections, there is no doubt that, following the decision, the case will go to An Bord Pleanála. While the Minister said the project was on course, has an appeal to An Bord Pleanála been built into the timeframe for development? Is it possible this will go the legal route given the effect on some of the residents and that, instead of the timeframe falling into place, there could be a serious deterioration of the timeframe in a short period? While I am concerned to ensure the stadium is built, residents are genuinely concerned that their lifestyle will change. What was a cul-de-sac will be a main entrance to the stadium and the lifestyle of residents will be changed. Is the Minister confident the timeframe for the project will be adhered to?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I do not accept the lifestyle of residents will be changed as a result of the construction of a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium at Lansdowne Road. It is the oldest rugby stadium in the world. Frankly, the alternative is worse. I have said previously that there would be a concrete jungle at Lansdowne Road if the stadium were not to go ahead. I would much prefer to have a stadium of the kind I have outlined than look into a concrete jungle of offices, apartments, commercial outlets and so on. In any event, one thing is certain: if the stadium does not get planning permission, alternatives will have to be looked at. Irrespective of what happens, it is unquestionable that Lansdowne Road will be developed for one reason or another.I am confident we will build a stadium at Lansdowne Road. We have met every deadline to date. There are 151 submissions, 130 of which are objections with the other 21 submissions of support in one guise or another. The intention was to commence construction early in 2007. If all goes well with the planning process, that remains the objective. The construction period is 29 months. We are still on schedule and, until such time as we come off schedule, I will not pre-empt the worst.

If there are delays, and given increasing building costs, for how long will the costing of €390 million be sustainable?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The revised cost of the stadium is of the order of €365 million. The Government's commitment is €191 million. It is anticipated that construction will commence in 2007 and will be completed in 29 months. These are the timeframes originally envisaged. When the price was set down at the commencement and for the variation that occurred thereafter, following the redesign, inflationary factors were taken into account in the assessment.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	385	Plans relating to any proposed relocation of Eircom league football grounds is entirely a matter for individual clubs to decide in consultation with the Eircom league board of control. I made no request to the club concerned to halt work on any proposed move. I have, however, requested the FAI to discuss the concept of ground sharing with a number of Dublin clubs.The recent Genesis report on the Eircom league made a number of recommendations across areas such as revised structures, marketing, community involvement and financial viability as part of a radical reform required by the league to secure its future. It also signalled the need for Dublin clubs to consider ground sharing as a means of securing the significant public investment required to provide modern city stadia necessary to attract higher attendances. This acknowledges the particular difficulty facing clubs located in Dublin seeking to expand or develop in locations where costs are prohibitive. The improvement of facilities to ensure high standard, safe, family friendly stadia conforming with club licensing requirements was identified as a key requirement of the report.I am fully supportive of the FAI's drive to develop the Eircom league, bringing higher standards, improved facilities and increased audiences impacting on the wider development of football in Ireland. My announcement last July of the allocation of €5.275 million in grants involving 16 Eircom league clubs underlines my commitment to the development of facilities for the Eircom league within the context of club licensing requirements and my support for a sensible and planned approach to this area.The concept of ground sharing among top flight football clubs is not a new one with many examples of top flight football teams in European cities. It is certainly worth careful consideration in Dublin. I have previously expressed my support for the concept which could lead to the existence of two modestly sized high quality modern soccer stadia in Dublin which might serve the needs of the main Dublin clubs. It is in this context that the issue of ground sharing among Dublin clubs has been discussed among other issues at meetings between me, my officials and the FAI.I have previously indicated my commitment to the completion of the new soccer stadium in Tallaght and I would support a similar development on Dublin's north side in an existing or new location. Against that background, the FAI had engaged in discussions with the main Dublin clubs to identify the options and the main issues for the clubs concerned. Clearly the recent decision arrived at by the members of a prominent Dublin football club to sell its stadium underlines the autonomy that the clubs enjoy and that, ultimately, it is for the clubs and their members to decide on their future.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The idea behind ground sharing by clubs is something I believe in. Given the overall costs of maintaining a stadium and so on, that is logical.I presume that when the Minister speaks of Tallaght, he also speaks of a club-sharing facility there. With regard to the newspaper reports on the two clubs and a decision on a new venue, if agreement cannot be reached, will that affect either of the clubs seeking lottery capital grants towards their facilities? Is it a question of a new stadium or the refurbishment of the existing stadium that would see the Minister looking at a capital investment? The best outcome would be complete new grounds and so on for the two north Dublin clubs, and the use of Tallaght. If the proposal does not proceed, will that affect application for the capital funding by the other club?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	387	It will. The Genesis report is clear on ground sharing and I have expressed my support for that report on a number of occasions. I have had discussions with the FAI which also believes it is necessary for us to have two medium-sized stadiums in Dublin so that the Eircom league can prosper. This makes perfect sense. For example, the facilities of the San Siro stadium, which has a capacity of 85,000, are shared by AC Milan and Inter Milan. Other examples are Lazio and Roma, and Juventus and Torino, while in Germany an example is the Bayern München and Gladbach football clubs. These are major clubs. We are asking that the four Eircom league clubs look at the situation sensibly. I anticipate ground sharing as the way forward. There is a need for two stadiums of a capacity of approximately 10,000 each and this would advance the cause of the league in Ireland.

Does he agree that ground sharing between different sporting organisations is equally important? Surely the Gaelic Athletic Association has some justification in looking for ground sharing in Tallaght. What is the Minister's view? Is he requesting that in any new arrangement where he will make a major investment of State funds there will be a facility or accommodation for the local GAA club in this new ground in Tallaght?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	389	In short, I am not because to do so would require us to have a lower capacity ground than will be in existence. This would be required if the pitch were to measure up to the measurements required for a standard size GAA pitch. In addition, a commitment was given that this particular stadium would be a home for Shamrock Rovers. I consciously made that commitment and it is one I will keep. It is not the case that other sports are completely excluded from the Tallaght stadium. I have no difficulty with other sports taking place there, but no provision can be made for the GAA there because it would require extending the pitch considerably and lowering the capacity of the stadium. All this would require further expense.The Dublin GAA county board will be aware of land at Rathcoole. I have indicated in the past that I would be prepared to consider favourably applications for funding for the development of the facility there.

At present, No. 5 South Leinster Street, which forms part of the National Gallery, is being renovated and refurbished. Approximately €5 million is being devoted to this project. The basement area of the building is being reinstated and the building fabric is being structurally stabilised. This will be an authentic restoration of a mid-18th century four storeys over basement terraced house with a substantial amount of late 18th century joinery and plasterwork. Work is expected to be finished around mid-2007.Further works at the National Gallery are being discussed by officials of the Office of Public Works and my Department in the context of the national development plan for 2007 to 2013. The Office of Public Works hopes to have design consultants in place by the end of the year. The matter will be considered further when a design report is completed.

In view of the importance of the National Gallery, will the Minister provide this money, if possible in the Estimates, because the gallery is within his remit? I remind him that the other national institutions, namely, the Abbey Theatre and the National Concert Hall, have been allocated funds for major refurbishment or have been promised funds. The National Gallery is the last institution waiting for major investment. That is why this is so important. I also remind the Minister that the director of the National Gallery during its most formative period was a Tarbert man, Tom McGreevy, who was director from 1951 to 1965 or 1966. That was a very important period, so obviously there would be a north Kerry interest in this matter as well.

The Acting Chairman is a Kerryman too. Deputy Wall should note it is three against one, like many a match.A development control plan was drawn up some years ago for the National Gallery which comprises ten phases. Phases one to four and six to ten of the plan consist of an 1884 wing, portrait gallery, new infill building, roof conservation and 1902 frontage, Milltown wing, refurbishment of entrance hall, work on forecourt and ancillary areas and development on Clare Lane.Deputy Deenihan is correct that, in 2004, costing was estimated at €32 million, but at this point funding is available only to bring the plan to design stage. A design team will be appointed by the Office of Public Works later this year to review and update the 2001 development control plan. It is probable the design team will suggest amendments, deletions and enhancements to the plan. If the amended plan suggested by the design team is of the same extent and quality of the 2001 plan, it is likely the funding required will be considerably in excess of €32 million. Naturally I will be doing my best to obtain the full amount in the context of the 2007 Estimates from the Minister for Finance.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	396	With regard to the overall aspect of the renovation, storage will clearly be needed for art objects in the National Gallery. Certain paintings are on loan to Members who have them hanging in their offices. Considering time is on the Minister's side, is it possible that some of these paintings can be leased to local authorities so they can be seen around the country rather than just in the National Gallery?

There is an enormous amount of merit in what Deputy Wall said on the outsourcing of material in the possession of the National Gallery to other agencies for exhibition. I recently saw this done effectively in Dingle, County Kerry, when the Irish Museum of Modern Art had an exhibition there. The opportunity exists for such events with the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery in Cork, the first designated national cultural institution outside of Dublin. There will be a close connection between the National Gallery and it for exchanges. I agree with the Deputy that there is much to be said for a far greater number of exhibitions of National Gallery paintings across the country. It would enhance the visual arts and I will encourage the director of the board in this regard.

If only all replies were so easy.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	402	If we had got all the answers to Priority Questions Nos. 9 and 10, we would not have to deal with these questions. When the Attorney General informed the Minister that due process must take place and the report must be sent to those involved, did he give a timeframe? Did he inform the Minister at what stage could the report then be released?

It was felt that around 15 days would be appropriate. With a report of this complexity and size, it would be necessary for the parties concerned to have time to consider it. It would be in breach of due process were I to seek early, urgent or inappropriately timed responses. The parties have been given ample time. On the close of business this evening, I will not accept any further submissions.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	404	Earlier the Minister inadvertently referred to the "outgoing chairman". Will the Minister confirm that Mr. Taggart is the chairman of Bord na gCon and is likely to continue in that post for some time? Will the Minister agree that the leaking of the report was targeted and selective? Will he agree it was damaging to the reputation and integrity of the chairman of Bord na gCon, Mr. Taggart? He is a respected businessman and it was obvious through his reaction that he is very incensed at the nature and timing of the leaks. I know the Minister has condemned the leaks. Will he confirm that this was an unfair treatment of Mr. Taggart? No decision can be made until we see all the details and discuss them in the House.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I repeat that I am deeply disappointed that these leaks occurred. I repeat that neither I nor any officials in the Department was involved in any of the leaks. It is regrettable that officials in the Department were accused of leaking sections of the report. I fully accept Deputy Deenihan's comments on Mr. Taggart. He is a respected businessman who has made a considerable contribution to the greyhound industry. I have never sought to deny that.After Mr. Dalton has completed his examination of the responses, the matter will be brought before the Government. I do not want to pre-empt what will occur then.Until one becomes the outgoing chairman, one should be referred to as the chairman.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	406	Will the Minister ensure, if he is involved in future appointments, that two women are appointed to Bord na gCon to establish a gender balance? If I introduce my Bill on control of the doping of greyhounds in private Members' time, will the Minister accept it? From the leaks of the report, it seems there will be a new procedure where the control of doping will be taken out of the hands of the board and the chairman will not be compromised as he was in this case. The chairman was put under considerable pressure because he announced greyhound owners were using illegal substances on their dogs. The greyhound industry is small and most people know each other. The chairman and the board members would know all the trainers and owners. If my Bill had been accepted, we would not be in this position and the chairman would not be the subject of this national campaign in the media. Will the Minister accept my private Members' Bill so that there will no recurrence of last October's events?

A woman from the Department was on the board until recently but unfortunately she resigned. I agree with the Deputy that it is important there is female representation on the board.With regard to accepting Deputy Deenihan's Bill, I will not pre-empt the contents or the recommendations of the Dalton report. As I indicated earlier, arising from the report there will be a necessity for legislation. Legislation governing the greyhound industry dates back to the Greyhound Industry Act 1958. It is archaic and needs to be changed. For example, a person can be appointed for numerous terms to the board. The chairman of the board does not have a fixed term. That is not the case with any other State agency. People will accept there is a need for the legislation to be changed. It is an open secret that there will have to be change.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 23 and 25 together.I am aware that concerns have been expressed about the risk of excessive prices being charged by certain elements of the Irish tourism and hospitality industry in the context of the Ryder Cup taking place in Ireland. The State tourism agencies are being particularly vigilant in this area and in all their dealings with the industry are taking the opportunity to encourage a commonsense approach to the pricing of our tourism products. In addition, my Department wrote to the Director of Consumer Affairs last November requesting that a special initiative be undertaken around the time of the Ryder Cup to ensure that price lists in restaurants and public houses are displayed prominently. The Director of Consumer Affairs has informed me that the appropriate checks will be carried out.Ireland will deliver value for money during the staging of the Ryder Cup. The vast majority of visitors will have purchased packages that have been priced for quite some time. Furthermore, all approved accommodation providers will have published maximum prices that they cannot legally exceed. Nevertheless, I will continue to raise these issues, as appropriate, in my regular contacts with the industry and in the media in the build-up to the Ryder Cup.In particular, I urge all tourism service providers to take a long-term perspective on the benefits of the event. The value of word of mouth publicity cannot be over-estimated and we want our visitors to return home with glowing reports about their stay here and confirmation that the hospitality and friendliness for which we are renowned really exists. More importantly, we want them to be able to say that the golf was excellent, that they received value for money and that they will want to come back again.I do not believe that the decision of the Government not to include the Ryder Cup on the list of designated events for free-to-air transmission will have any adverse impact from a tourism perspective. My Department was consulted about the possible designation. As the House will be aware from the press statement issued at the time by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the decision not to so designate the event was made on the basis that it did not meet all the necessary criteria and the reasonable expectation that it would remain outside the remit of free-to-air for 2006 given that it had been decided not to include it at the time of the first designation.From a tourism perspective, media access to our key international markets is paramount and in this regard the Ryder Cup represents an unprecedented opportunity to showcase the island of Ireland to a worldwide television audience of 1 billion people in 150 countries, including 56 million golfers worldwide. Earlier this year I announced that, in addition to providing an additional €4.5 million to Fáilte Ireland to support an enhanced programme of marketing and promotion activities around the Ryder Cup, it was agreed that Fáilte Ireland would engage with the European Tour for delivery of an appropriate complementary programme of events, including initiatives intended to raise the profile of the occasion within Ireland and enhancing the official opening and closing ceremonies.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I could not disagree more with the Minister on the matter of designation of the Ryder Cup for free-to-air transmission on television. It was an unbelievable error not to include the event and not to ensure that it would be seen on national television channels because those in Ireland involved in general tourism during the event will not have that facility if they are situated in an area without access to Sky television. Indeed, I am told that only 14% of people access Sky television. I could never understand the logic of what the Minister did in this regard and I still believe it is a matter which he should consider. Certainly, not including this event was a major error because in our lifetime we may not see it here again. It has become such a world event that it may not be possible to hold the Ryder Cup again in Ireland in the future. The Minister certainly threw away a major chance of ensuring that it could be viewed by the maximum number of tourists who will be in Ireland at the time of the Ryder Cup but not here for that event, and of developing links with golf here in that regard.On the question on the long-term damage to the tourism industry, the chief executive of Tourism Ireland, Mr. Paul O'Toole, was quoted in an article in The Irish Times as stating that it is a marvellous opportunity to showcase Ireland but it is crucial that we do not fleece the customers while they are here and that hotels in Dublin and Kildare will not charge rack rates or top prices approximately 25% to 28% above the average. Surely that sets the trend for everything else attached to the Ryder Cup. I am flabbergasted. If the person most involved in generating tourism from the event states it is all right if the prices rise by only 25% to 28%, how can the Minister honestly state that he will try to control prices during the Ryder Cup? It is unbelievable to think that would be said in the context of a rip-off.One must bear in mind that there will be tourists in Ireland at the time of the Ryder Cup not solely attached to the event. Will we see an aspect of differing treatment in hotels, where regular tourists will be charged ordinary prices and a Ryder Cup tourist will be charged 25% to 28% more? If the Minister is to try to set a trend right across all aspects of the services involved in providing for the Ryder Cup, surely the statement to which I refer should be retracted as a matter of urgency. It is unbelievable that a 25% to 28% rise is acceptable. If Tourism Ireland agrees that immediately we should accept a 25% to 28% increase, there are no grounds for the Minister to argue the point. How can the Minister get that statement retracted and how can the Minister's argument be channelled down to all the various aspects of the services involved in this?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I do not think the chief executive of Tourism Ireland believes it is quite all right for people to raise prices by 20% to 25% just because a major event, the Ryder Cup, is being held in their locality. People should recognise that the tourism business is not a short-term one and does not exist for short-term gain. It is a long-term business. It is, quite simply, our single largest indigenous service industry and is generating enormous revenue. Revenue from tourism last year, with a record 6.9 million visitors yielded, before carrier receipts and transport costs, was almost €3.5 billion. This is an enormous amount of money and if one includes the domestic element, the industry is worth approximately €5 billion to the economy.One will always find that a minority of people will buck the trend and attempt to make the fast buck in a slip-shod wink and nudge way. They do a grave disservice to the majority in the industry who wish to ensure that people enjoy the experience and return home with the view that Ireland was a wonderful place to visit and, above all, that they were treated fairly. In that respect, approved accommodation providers must advertise the maximum rates which they charge. At certain times of the year the same accommodation providers charge less than they would at other times. For example, when the Ryder Cup took place in the Belfry, demand exceeded supply, as it will in Kildare and in surrounding areas during the course of the Ryder Cup. When it was held in the Belfry room yields in Birmingham increased by 36% for the period around the competition. I do not wish to see that replicated in Ireland.I am confident that Ireland will deliver value for money relative to other Ryder Cup venues. In any event the vast majority of visitors will have purchased their packages before they arrive here and they will know precisely the cost because these have been priced, and deals concluded, for some time. Furthermore, as I stated, all approved accommodation providers will have published maximum prices which they cannot legally exceed.Incidentally, all sectors of the tourism industry are acutely aware of the value for money issues and the available research from Fáilte Ireland suggests that in an overall sense the consumer is very satisfied with the cost of accommodation and of the golf product in Ireland, although less so, admittedly, as I stated previously, with the cost of drinks and eating out. However, the level of overseas competition continues to grow and, as such, Deputy Wall can be assured that there is no complacency in this matter.The Ryder Cup offers Ireland's tourism industry a golden opportunity, not just to showcase our golf product but to showcase the beauty of our country and, more specifically, the value for money available in Ireland. I appeal to the industry across the country to take that opportunity.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	411	In view of the fact that bringing the Ryder Cup to Ireland cost taxpayers in the region of €16 million, surely they should be entitled to at least see it free-to-air. As Deputy Wall stated, only one in five households here have Sky Sports. The Government could have included this event in the legislation. The excuse that golf is not considered part of Irish culture is rather lame. More people are playing golf in parts of the country than any other sport. It is very much part of the discussion in pubs where people speak more about golf than almost any other sport.In deciding that the Ryder Cup should not be free-to-air, the Government has done a major disservice to the taxpayers. It was their money that brought this event to Ireland and come September when people find out they have to pay €700 or some such sum to Sky in order to see the Ryder Cup they will be most annoyed in view of the investment they have already made in it.I do not know if the matter is open to negotiation with Sky. Perhaps an arrangement could be made with RTE so its viewers could view the event free-to-air or will the Minister indicate if it is possible for the Government to contribute a fee? If there is a window of opportunity, it should be explored because the current situation is grossly unfair.In terms of what Deputy Wall said about pricing, the Minister should send out the word to golf clubs around the country not to increase their prices for this event as thousands of American golfers will come here in the weeks before the event and they will see the prices in June, July and August and if prices are increased for September it will send out a bad signal about Ireland.

It is further the case that the designation did not meet with the criteria in accordance with the advice of the Attorney General so it was not possible to designate it. Even if it had been possible to designate, I must be honest and state we reached a deal with the European tour, in as much as we reach deals with other sporting organisations across the world in regard to the hosting of certain events in Ireland, in which certain understandings, written or oral, were reached. It is important those understandings are honoured. If it is the case that we stop honouring understandings, then I am afraid what will eventually happen is that people will not trust us to host major events.

To date in 2006, the initiative has supported 16 events, not only in golf but also in other sports such as yachting, showjumping, rugby, athletics, motor racing and windsurfing.It is the case that RTE can negotiate freely with Sky with a view to sorting out this problem. Ireland is a relatively low market in comparison to Sky's potential market in terms of this event.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The review of the designated events was a sham. There is no excuse for not having this event free-to-air. I do not know why we went through that process when commitments had clearly been made. I received replies to parliamentary questions stating no commitments had been made. In recent weeks I read in a daily or Sunday newspaper of the amount of money the Government has committed towards the event. It is a wonderful event and I look forward to it. I know it will be a major success.

I have been told categorically by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that no commitments were entered into.Not only are people taking a short-term view of the tourism industry by ripping people off but they are letting down the industry and the voluntary effort that is being put in by communities around the event centre in the K Club in Kildare who have been adding to the event.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 9, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:8. Without prejudice to the generality of section 7—(a) a determination as to a person’s eligibility for a repayment of recoverable health charges shall be made as soon as is reasonably possible and in each case no later than—(i) 28 days after an application has been lodged, or(ii) the commencement of this Act, whichever is the later, and(b) once a determination has been made as to a person’s eligibility for a repayment of recoverable health charges, such a payment shall be made as soon as is reasonably possible and in each case no later than 28 days after such a determination has been made.The amendment relates to the period of 28 days following an application being lodged within which a payment would accrue to the person making the claim. This issue arose almost a year and eight months ago. Legislation was introduced to ratify the deduction.It will be almost two years since Deputy Perry exposed this issue before any payment will accrue to the residents of public nursing homes. As a result of the delay many of the people who were eligible for payments have passed on. The average time a person spends in a nursing home is two to three years. Is it the case that 30% to 40% of those who were entitled to refunds when this issue first came into the public domain have passed on? Will the Minister of State outline in his reply when payments will commence? At one stage it was indicated that payments would commence in August of this year. Will the Minister please clarify the position?The aim of the amendment is to ensure a person will get his or her repayment within 28 days of an application being lodged. Procrastination has been the hallmark of the introduction of this Bill to facilitate repayments to those in long-stay nursing homes, including people in psychiatric hospitals and those with intellectual disabilities who are in institutions. By August, it will be almost two years from the day when Deputies Perry and Kenny exposed the illegal charges levied on very vulnerable people. We ask the Minister of State to accept that payment should be made 28 days after lodging the application.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	426	l do not accept this amendment because it places a deadline on the period for determining eligibility under the scheme and there may be a delay in certain cases in determining eligibility where an applicant had not applied for a medical card but who fell within the income-means threshold for a medical card.The scope of the scheme will apply to fully eligible people, that is, medical card holders and those over 70, with effect from July 2001. To ensure that repayments are made in an equitable manner, those who do not have a medical card on admission to long-stay care but who fall within the income-means threshold for a medical card will be regarded as having full eligibility for the purpose of the scheme. This will include those in publicly funded long-stay care, patients in public contracted beds in private nursing homes and patients in receipt of inpatient services in community settings.The Department has been in contact with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to assist in the determination of eligibility by virtue of being in receipt of the non-contributory old age pension and has offered its assistance in this regard. I do not accept this amendment which proposes repayment within 28 days of determination of a person's eligibility because it is not proposed to include a deadline for making repayments, given the extended period of time during which some patients may have been in care and the significant numbers of records that may need to be checked in certain cases.However, repayments will be made as promptly as possible following receipt of an application. No deadline has been included in this provision as some applications will take longer than 28 days to process, depending on the complexity of the application and whether accurate records are available. An applicant will also be given an appropriate timeframe to appeal the determination of money to be repaid. Applications will be processed as quickly as possible, having regard to the individual circumstances pertaining to each application. The uppermost consideration will be to ensure that the relevant person receives the full amount of repayment due.The Act contains a provision that ensures that repayments to living persons are prioritised over the repayments to estates. We acknowledge the role played by Deputy Perry and that, as an Opposition figure, he behaved very responsibly in this regard. Following the Supreme Court decision, we gave certain commitments and produced deadlines in good faith. On Second Stage, I clearly explained the reason for the delay in bringing forward the legislation. Apart from introducing the most expensive repayment scheme ever seen in this country, in general terms, we are paying money to people who are very vulnerable. Therefore, we must ensure proper safeguards are in place to guarantee the money is paid to the people who deserve it and that it is not abused and does not enter other hands. A considerable amount of communication took place and many matters needed to be resolved before we could produce the legislation.From our perspective, the legislation cannot be introduced quickly enough. Once we publish the legislation, we are anxious to get it through the Houses as quickly as possible. I indicated that the decision to appoint an outside company will go before the board of the Health Service Executive on 1 June 2006 and that the repayment process will begin in July 2006. We have provided €400 million in the 2006 Estimates to kick-start the repayment process and if more money is required, we will provide it. There is no saving from our perspective. I have been asked whether the percentage of people entitled to repayments is 30% or 40%. I do not know for certain but I would be surprised if the figure was that high. Naturally, some of the people in question will have died but their estates will be entitled to apply for repayment, so from our perspective, the sum of money that was due 12 months ago has not changed. There will be no delays on our side in respect of repaying the money.The request for 28 days is unnecessary. Some complications will arise. For example, certain individuals could become ill or be forced to be absent for a week or two, which could delay repayment. There will certainly be no delay. The contract into which the HSE is entering with the outside company will last two years. It is not in our interests to delay repayments. We are happy to see them processed as quickly as possible.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Having listened to the Minister of State, I am slightly disappointed that he has not been more proactive in respect of this amendment. I acknowledge that difficulties can arise. If the Minister stated that the policy of his Department was to ensure as far as practicable that all applications would be submitted within 28 days, it might go some way towards demonstrating that the Department is serious about this issue.We have been waiting for over a year for the documentation to which the Minister of State refers. Notwithstanding this, departmental officials are well aware of the vast majority of people who are entitled to repayments. The Minister of State argues that he will pass all this documentation to the new body that is being established. This harks back to the other aspect to which I referred earlier in the debate when I stated that this should have been done on an in-house basis. Has work been carried out in respect of breaking down the categories of people to see whether the necessary documentation has been submitted or are we waiting for this new body, which was pushed through earlier to finalise and issue repayments, to begin to examine all the documentation?One of the merits of having the public sector deal with this issue is that it could have been dealing with it for the past year and finalising everything. Therefore, when the scheme is introduced, the system could be ready to make repayments within 14 days rather than 28 days. Some commitment must be given in respect of ensuring this takes place. It is not good enough for the Government to simply say that it will do its best but that certain individuals may be off work sick. If this happens, we must realise that we are dealing with people who could be dead tomorrow. If a dateline was issued, it would make the senior personnel involved, who will be well paid to carry out this work, prioritise it and get applications within a certain date. This is the merit of amendment No. 4, which will ensure that applications are prioritised. If the Government is not prepared to go down this road — it appears that the Minister of State is not willing to do so — the least he can do is give a commitment in principle that every effort will be made to ensure it is done within 28 days, as referred to in the amendment.What is the position regarding medical card holders who were unable to secure a place in a public nursing home and, as I noted on Second Stage, whose relations may have been obliged to obtain a loan from a credit union or other financial institution to maintain them in a nursing home? Are there proposals to look after these people? Under the Constitution, they are entitled to care, not only in a public hospital, but in long-term care facilities. They were denied this entitlement because no beds were available and they consequently needed to pay for care. Will the Minister of State examine the category of people who must make this effort?
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	428	Two points must be addressed. A number of consultations between the Departments of Health and Children, Finance and Social and Family Affairs, the Health Service Executive, the Office of the Attorney General, the Revenue Commissioners, the probate office of the High Court, the Courts Service, the Office of the Wards of Court and the Office of the Ombudsman needed to take place before we could publish the legislation. The purpose of the talks was to ensure the provisions of the scheme adequately addressed all the issues, many of which have been mentioned in the House.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	433	——on the part of anyone in the Department of Health and Children to unnecessarily delay these payments. However, if we were to include a 28-day time limit in legislation, it would place significant constraints on all parties involved. It is unnecessary and could have legal implications.If a particular person who was dealing with the file was laid up at home for a couple of days, the money could be paid in 29 days instead of 28 days. This amendment would leave one open to having a case taken against one. We have provided the money and are trying to push the legislation through as quickly as possible.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Our experience is that the time limit is necessary. A year and eight months has passed since it was determined that money was illegally deducted from people in long-stay nursing homes and institutions. We are asking that a determination of a person's eligibility is made as soon as reasonably possible after an application has been received but no later than 28 days. If the Minister of State were to read the amendment, he would see that we are giving the Government 28 days. The amendment would also require payments to be made within a further 28 days.We want to give a strong signal. Delays have occurred and people who were eligible for payments when this issue was exposed have since died. The tardiness of and approach by the Government to this matter from the outset does not instil us with confidence that payments will be made as quickly as possible. There is concern that the attitude will be one of how to refuse payment rather than how to facilitate it. This negative attitude would lead to long delays in payments, which would result in stress among the elderly, who may not fully comprehend what is happening but know that money is coming to them, and stress on the families of people in institutions who must answer those family members' questions about what happened. Two 28-day periods is not an unreasonable time within which to make payments. We do not trust the Government to do it.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The Government would have at least 56 days.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I clearly explained our efforts to try to make the scheme as simple as possible so that people can get their money without requiring recourse to legal assistance or incurring the expenses involved therein.The system will operate in such a way that once an application has been processed and an agreement reached on the amount of money due, the person in question will be notified. He or she will have 28 days to appeal the decision if he or she feels short-changed.

Dragging out the affair will induce stress among people who are at a certain stage of their lives and families who must react to the people owed money.This money rightfully belongs to the residents of the homes, not the Government. I accept that the Government will allocate €400 million this year, but it is not the Government's money. It was illegally deducted from the residents and the Minister of State should put a time limit on its repayment.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I move amendment No. 12:
In page 16, line 30, to delete "A" and substitute "An aggrieved".This amendment addresses the issue raised by Deputy McManus on Committee Stage in regard to appeals. Legal advice received from the Attorney General is that no person who is not a party to a decision can appeal a decision made against that party without special permission. This is clear from the rules of the superior courts where no person not a party to a judgment can appeal against it unless the court, under special application for exceptional reasons, allows one to do so. The court is clear that no person has a right to be joined to an appeal without special permission of the court hearing the appeal. To minimise any confusion that may arise regarding this matter, the term "aggrieved person" is being used to indicate that only an affected person can appeal against the decision.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I thank the Minister of State for that clarification.

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	461	Amendment No. 13 arose from a suggestion put forward by Deputy McManus. We accepted amendment No. 12 but there is a different definition in amendment No. 13. We made the point that it was heavy-handed to have an elaborate appeals system for claims but no right of appeal against demand for repayments where the contractor is satisfied that there has been misrepresentation. In fairness to the Minister, he indicated on Committee Stage that he was prepared to examine that aspect and in the spirit of that commitment the Labour Party accepted his point and did not submit an amendment because we felt his would be positive. From the evidence I have seen and the advice I have got, however, the Minister has got this completely wrong.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	462	The Deputy is referring to amendment No. 14.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	463	My apologies. On amendment No. 13, we believe it should have been examined somewhat differently. We are not satisfied with this aspect but given that it is linked to amendment No. 12 I will accept what the Minister is saying.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	464	Amendment No. 14 is in the name of the Minister. Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are related and therefore amendments Nos. 14 to 16, inclusive, may be discussed together.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 18, line 36, to delete "the scheme administrator is satisfied" and substitute:"it comes to the knowledge of the scheme administrator".This amendment addresses a concern raised by Deputy McManus regarding the Health Service Executive determining whether a case of fraud has occurred without recourse to the courts. Under the Irish Constitution, only a court is empowered to determine a question of fraud. Where the HSE believes there has been fraud, it can claim that such fraud has occurred but only a court can decide whether there has been any fraud. The amendment is to reduce any confusion on this issue. The proposed procedure in possible cases of fraud is that the scheme administrator would bring any concerns it may have regarding fraud to the attention of the Health Service Executive. The executive may then, having investigated the matter, bring a claim alleging fraud and ask the applicant for an amount determined due to the executive. The applicant has the option of returning the outstanding money, or the executive may seek the recovery of the money through the courts.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	466	This is an aspect of the Bill which Deputy McManus felt very strongly about. She felt it could be dealt with in another manner. The amendment, as far as we are concerned, does not deal with the issue and is not a proper definition. It may well lead to problems down the line with regard to misrepresentation. Be that as it may, if the Minister of State is not prepared to come forward with a stronger amendment, there is not much we can do as members of the Opposition. I would like to hear the comments of the Minister of State on the issue. Will he give further consideration to what I have said?
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	467	While we have a duty to repay the money, if the Health Service Executive discovered that money had been fraudulently claimed, we also have a duty to make every effort to ensure it would be repaid. The system is similar to other appeal systems, where the relevant person would be notified if money may have been claimed and paid out under false pretences.We would indicate that it had come to our attention that the person received money which he or she did not deserve. The normal procedure would be that they are asked to repay the money. We would hope that dialogue would be opened between the parties, and in the event of money not being paid, we could resort to the courts if required.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	468	We are discussing the money not being paid. This is linked with an amendment I spoke on previously, and on which nobody seems to want to answer. On the one hand there are fraudulent payments, but I put it to the Minister of State that the State owes money to medical card holders who could not get into public nursing homes. I have asked the question time and again.An elderly person who is entitled to care and attention, not only in a public hospital but in a public nursing home, may not have been able to get into such a facility. They would have had to borrow, along with their family, to get into nursing home facilities, the provision of which they should have been entitled to by the State. Those people are entitled to a repayment by the State. I have asked time and again what will be done on this issue. What will the State do for these people, who are entitled to a refund which is not being provided?The Minister of State has talked about fraud, but the State is defrauding these people in not paying. I would like the Minister of State to indicate whether these people will be repaid, as they are entitled to be.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	469	It is in response to the Supreme Court decision that we have this Bill before us. A particular group of people were wrongly charged, and we are paying back money to those people. What we are putting in place is legislation to pay such people, with a safeguard provision in the event of people receiving money under false pretences. We would have a mechanism in place to reclaim money for the State in that case. Nobody in their right mind could object to us putting such a system in place. The matter raised by the Deputy is separate.

The Supreme Court made a decision and the legislation has come about on foot of that. It was quite clear about the people who were illegally charged, and they are the people to whom we are repaying the money.

I warmly welcome that the Planning and Development Act is being amended to provide for the following. There is the introduction of a strategic consent process for strategic infrastructure of national importance provided by other statutory bodies and private promoters. There is also the restructuring of An Bord Pleanála to allow for the establishment of a strategic infrastructure division to handle all major infrastructure projects.The types of infrastructure which can be processed include major environmental transport and energy-related projects. The decision as to whether a particular project is to be taken under a strategic consent process is a matter entirely, in each case, for An Bord Pleanála. Each application will be looked at individually.I welcome the introduction of a one-step strategic consent procedure for certain types of major infrastructure. Responsibility for deciding on approvals of railway orders, including light rail and metros, will now be transferred from the Minister for Transport to An Bord Pleanála. A new division will be established within An Bord Pleanála to handle decisions on all major infrastructure projects. It will include major local authority projects and motorways, which are already the responsibility of An Bord Pleanála. Included in this also are strategic gas infrastructure consents, major electricity transmission lines and railway orders.The types of infrastructure to be covered by the strategic consent process include environmental, energy and transport infrastructure. Persons or bodies, including State and semi-State organisations, seeking permission for those types of strategic infrastructure will apply first to An Bord Pleanála for a decision on whether the particular project is of strategic importance.Where An Bord Pleanála decides the project is of strategic importance, an application with an environmental impact statement can be made directly to the board. The public, the local authority — including elected members — and interested stakeholders will be consulted and their views taken into account. Major changes to the way in which the board handles infrastructure consents include the possibility of pre-application discussions with the applicant and more flexibility in the decision which the board can make on the application. I particularly welcome this increased flexibility. The Bill gives power to the board to amend decisions on major infrastructure projects, subject to an assessment of major environmental impacts, and to require infrastructure providers to provide direct benefits to communities affected by major infrastructure projects. It also requires the board to have regard to the national interest and to the effect a decision may have on issues of strategic or economic importance to the State, as well as the national spatial strategy and any regional planning guidelines in force in an area.It is important to acknowledge a number of the measures in the Bill to strengthen local democracy. It proposes expanding the existing role of An Bord Pleanála, which is already responsible for deciding on roads, motorways, water and local authority waste water proposals, on all of which it consults widely. It proposes extending the opportunities of local communities, residence groups, environmental groups and ordinary citizens to comment on applications, which is very welcome. I particularly welcome the facility for elected members to express their views to the board on applications made under the proposed strategic consent process. Currently none of the public representatives present has the opportunity to make known to An Bord Pleanála his or her views or those of the people he or she represents. We are not recognised and have no official part to play in the process so I welcome the additional role public representatives, at local and national level, will have. While we are involved in the planning process via our engagement with the local authorities that does not continue when An Bord Pleanála assumes responsibility for a project.In our modern economy many new infrastructural requirements have a national dimension. To build on ongoing development the country must have an infrastructure consent procedure which recognises the national dimension but also takes into account local concerns. The Bill promotes an acceleration of the planning process for critical infrastructure but democracy should be respected and local concerns taken into account in pursuit of a balanced solution, which did not exist in the past.Section 35 of the Planning Act is to be amended to make it easier for authorities to refuse consent without recourse to the High Court. Instead it will be for the applicant who has been refused permission to seek an order from the High Court that the local authority reconsider its initial decision. This has the effect of reversing the burden of proof. The developer will instead have to show that his or her past performance does not warrant the refusal of permission. It should make it easier for local authorities to tackle poor performance by rogue developers.The Government has been concerned by delays caused by lengthy challenges to major projects. The President of the High Court will introduce new arrangements to improve procedures for such cases, including the designation of specific judges to manage the process. This will build on the precedent of the commercial court and should have a similar impact on improving case management. There have been many examples of inexplicable delays in critical pieces of infrastructure, in some cases for very trivial reasons.I am a man of nature and we all recall the snail on the Kildare bypass. A constituent of mine was considering moving a roadside hedgerow to make a substandard road safer. A local authority planner — I meet many on a daily basis — told him he was to leave the hedgerow in place. I dispute that policy because people must come first and wildlife second. I hold that opinion very strongly and believe we should accommodate people. I am deviating from the subject but sometimes we show too much concern for wildlife at the expense of people, such as applicants for once-off housing.The Bill will provide for a better service for all stakeholders, namely infrastructure providers, State bodies, and the general public. Public representatives are, for the first time, to be allowed to deal with the board in an official capacity. The board will, in some cases, be obliged to enter into consultation with public representatives.It also proposes a single stage process for the approval of projects, a rigorous assessment of all projects, including environmental impacts, full public consultation and certainty of timeframes. All Members will have experience in their own constituencies of mobile telephone companies siting or proposing to site telecommunications masts in built-up residential areas, near schools, hospitals or houses. They are critical pieces of infrastructure and we all want a mobile telephone service in this age of technology but it is difficult to know why applicants do not enter into more consultation or exercise more care as to where they site their masts. They seem to just pick a spot, often belonging to vulnerable landowners. Before the owners know what has happened they are tied into a contract and all hell breaks loose in a parish. I have seen parishes divided on the issue. I compliment the efforts and the responsible manner in which my local authority, Limerick County Council, and the director of services and planning and his officials, have dealt with such applications in the past. On the one hand they have acknowledged the need for such critical infrastructure but on the other have heeded the concerns of people on the ground.While I have no more evidence than anybody else that a mobile telephone mast can damage health, the jury is out. While the jury is out we must err on the side of caution. If we realise in ten or 15 years' time that they can damage health it will be too late. I do not know if mobile telephone masts will be included as critical infrastructure but my preference is for them to be treated as they currently are, proceeding through local democratic channels and the local planning process, in which I have the utmost faith.

The Government has embarked on delivering a long list of infrastructural projects throughout the country and new legislation is needed to ensure that those projects are delivered as quickly and as efficiently as possible in order to continue with the economic development of our country in a sustainable manner.Gaps in our critical infrastructure pose a real threat to Ireland's growth in the future. The decentralisation programme currently being implemented by the Government is dependent on adequate infrastructure and services being made available. The House will be delighted to know that decentralisation to Knock airport in Mayo is going ahead and accommodation is currently provided in Claremorris.

Bottlenecks in the planning process have for too long delayed projects and, in the final analysis, contributed to the escalating cost of implementation.l welcome the provision in the Bill for a single approval for electricity transmission lines. The lack of sufficient electricity supply has always been a problem in rural Ireland and without the availability of a three phase supply smaller industries suitable for towns and villages in counties Iike Mayo find it difficult to get off the ground. The development of other necessary infrastructural facilities such as water and sewerage, roads, railways and airports should not be delayed by poor planning procedure and this Bill provides the framework whereby all such projects will proceed through planning in an expeditious and transparent manner.When delivering strategic infrastructure it is very important local people have the right to express their views and to have their grievances taken on board. I am pleased the Bill allows a role for local authority councillors to express their views on applications made under the proposed strategic consent process. This is a positive development for local democracy as it establishes for the first time a specific right and responsibility in law to allow the views of local authority members to be made known, recorded and sent to the strategic infrastructure division of An Bord Pleanála.For far too long objectors to projects have appeared from nowhere at the last minute to file vexatious objections to planning permission for major projects. In some instances these objections are for no apparent reason other than to cause massive disruption and impose excessive costs on the promoters and, ultimately, the taxpayer. I welcome the fact that the Bill seeks to deal with the problem of people who have sought to subvert the planning process in pursuit of their own agendas. While no one should be denied the right to object or protest about such matters, the system must be balanced. Due regard should be given to these rights, but objections should be adjudicated upon speedily in order that the future of projects can be decided as quickly as possible.The Bill will allow for a more focused approach to planning issues in respect of strategic infrastructure and provide a better service for all involved in the promotion of such projects. This will take place through a single stage process of approval for projects, a rigorous assessment of all projects against sustainability and environmental criteria, full public consultation, including a statutory right for councillors to be heard, as well as certainty in regard to timeframes and costs. The Bill strikes the correct balance between the individual's rights and the broader public and national interest. I congratulate the Minister on bringing the legislation before the House.Yesterday evening, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the opening of Knock Airport which has an annual passenger throughput of 650,000. As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Cowley, is well aware, if planning permission were sought for a new airport, the number of objections to ensue would be such as to prevent any such project from proceeding. Common sense must prevail with regard to the development of rural areas.

I recall that during a previous contribution on Second Stage of an environmental Bill, I made repeated reference to my home county of Wicklow and Deputy Glennon later berated me for doing so. I make no apology for representing the views of the people of County Wicklow and part of County Carlow who elected me, and I will not hesitate to continue to fulfil that important role.County Wicklow has had several high profile cases in which difficulties arose in progressing infrastructure projects. They include a delay of 12 or 13 years in constructing a sewerage plant in Arklow due to objections made by a small number of people. The result has been that raw sewage continues to be deposited in the sea. I do not propose to list the litany of procedures which have already been exhausted as they are too complicated for a mere mortal such as me to follow. I do not know the current position of the proposed plant because I and residents of the area have grown weary of tabling parliamentary questions on the issue, but raw sewerage continues to flow into the Irish Sea off the Arklow bank.Deputies will also recall the furore associated with a road building project in the Glen of the Downs when a group of eco-warriors camped out and caused more damage to the area than the subsequent construction works, which included a tree planting programme. The new road is now used by many people, including eco-warriors, and has made life easier for commuters. I have not noticed any negative impact on the environment and, in fact, the road will enhance the area in the long-term because many more trees were planted than were removed during the works.The lack of infrastructure has been a prominent feature of public debate in recent years. Ireland has experienced rapid growth in the number of people in employment and the number of cars on the roads. While we must all share the blame for the pressure these developments have placed on infrastructure, the Government must shoulder the main burden of blame because it has been in the driving seat throughout most of the relevant period. Departmental officials and those involved in political life are too involved in the day-to-day running of projects and carrying out fire brigade actions. As a result, they do not plan strategically and the country has paid the cost of this failure. I hope we will learn a valuable lesson.In light of the recent problems to emerge in the area of criminal law, it could be argued that if the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform were to employ a futurologist to examine issues and forecast potential problems, as many private companies do, many of the problems we experience would not arise. It would not take much to pay a few people to think rather than act.We will all be aware of several small projects in our own areas which we would have liked completed in recent years but which did not proceed owing to a lack of money, vision or will. I ask the Minister of State to relay to his senior Minister my proposal that county managers and directors of services visit urban areas and rural villages to examine local problems and take on board the views of local representatives who have the general well-being of their area at heart and see things officials do not see. They could point out the problems to try to have them addressed.The absence of accountability among local authorities causes frustration and few members of local communities have time for their local authority because they do not see its presence locally or what good it does. Many simple problems are not addressed, even though they could easily be rectified if local communities were given €10,000 or €20,000 to do so. Politicians waste a great deal of time relaying requests from local communities to local authorities to have basic housekeeping measures carried out. They may involve clearing out a ditch, washing a sign or removing a corner. For this reason, some form of inspection process is required whereby administrators go into local communities to look at the deficits and difficulties experienced in specific areas.This Bill has been a number of years in the making. As previous speakers stated, its purpose is to strike a balance between the common good and individual rights. While this may appear an easy task from an objective point of view, it may prove a little more difficult at a subjective level. A failing common to us all is that infrastructure projects are fine when they are in someone else's back yard but are not so pleasant when they are in ours.It is important that the House sends out a message that the purpose of the Bill is not to override environmental concerns or bulldoze projects through. Environmental considerations must remain paramount and, in this connection, I note the requirement to include an environmental impact statement with an application for planning permission. I hope, however, that the legislation will streamline the planning process.The Bill includes a list of the type of projects which may be considered under the strategic consent process. The Minister noted that many issues will go before the board for adjudication. I wonder whether it would be preferable to remove the planning section in local authorities given that virtually every planning application goes before An Bord Pleanála in any event. Rather than submitting applications to local authorities, it would be preferable to pool resources in one body of final arbitration. I often come across applications which do not receive the attention they deserve from the relevant local authority because officials take the view that any decision will be appealed to An Bord Pleanála and it is preferable, therefore, having held up the application for several months, to pass the problem on to the higher authority. If this body works successfully, I would like to see its role expanded rather than maintaining a narrow focus. Nowadays, any proposed development of five to ten houses is appealed to An Bord Pleanála. We are aware of the long delays that can occur when the board deals with appeals to it.The Bill refers to elected representatives having an input in the new process, which is welcome. It will be interesting to see how elected representatives vote. One of the things we decry in local government is the fact that local representatives have no power, yet when they have power, they fail to exercise it. If we are asked to site a landfill or adjudicate on a Traveller halting site, we run a mile, yet these issues must be faced up to. That can only be done if everybody takes responsibility for addressing problems in their own areas and an onus is placed on them to do so. Kicking the ball from Billy to Jack is not satisfactory. Unfortunately, politicians get away with it because the public is not conversant with the system in play. The public is not aware of people who consistently oppose matters.People will always lobby against controversial projects. It is a pity we do not have a plaque on each project, however, to state who supported or opposed it. Once a project is running successfully, it is difficult to find those who were initially opposed to it. The Minister, Deputy Roche, will be familiar with a shopping centre in Greystones, County Wicklow, which was opposed by a number of people. The project went to An Bord Pleanála but it would be difficult to find people nowadays who do not support the centre. The same could be said for road and housing projects.Councillors must have responsibility and a little more power than they enjoy. They will have an input as a result of this legislation. The Minister was a councillor for a long period so he will know that councillors become weary of going cap in hand or on their knees, so to speak, to various directors humbly seeking a small favour. They need to have more power than that. I hope that in the short time the Minister has left in that job, he might be able to——

Something could be done to give more power and accountability to councillors. I previously raised the concept of getting county managers and directors out into the community to see problems at first hand. In my Army days, we would come back six months or a year later to see if the money had been well spent to resolve an issue and if it had worked successfully. We are all aware of small projects we could seek for five, six or seven years, yet if we put the same energy into doing the work ourselves with a pick and shovel, we could solve the problem much sooner.The Minister referred to a grant for local community gain. Where there is a downside project, such as a landfill or incinerator, there must be a gain for the community. Allied to that gain the message must go out that if one community takes a downside project, when it is terminated, the next such project should be sited in another community. We must all take our share.

People who are in the immediate proximity to landfill sites should get some funding. One may not be able to give money to the residents, but those closest to such sites are suffering. It is difficult to identify a project for them but perhaps there could be a mechanism whereby a grant could be given to them for environmental works in the vicinity of their residences. For example, they may need to install windows, hedging or fencing because they suffer more than the community at large. Some communities have benefited greatly from the environmental fund but those in the immediate vicinity of downside projects and upon whom they have greatest impact may not be included. I would appreciate it if the Minister could examine that matter. Perhaps I should not be giving him too many ideas at this late stage but I am sure he will use them in a responsible manner.

I hope I will still want it at that stage.The Bill states that the board will meet both the developer and the objector, which is important. Currently, the pre-planning concept is not working well. As our pre-planning situation has evolved, it now takes longer than the planning process itself and one can receive bland answers. I have advised people who have come to me recently not to bother with the pre-planning process because it is a waste of time and one gets an inconclusive result. It is important for the board to meet the developer and the objector, however. There is nothing wrong with an authority meeting a developer. Owing to difficulties in recent times, a mystique has developed and people say something must be wrong if officials meet developers. When people try to get a project up and running, however, they must know the parameters within which they can work. Equally, those opposed to a project should have an opportunity to voice their concerns. I respect the right of every citizen to have his or her say in objecting to something.Things could impact upon someone that I might feel would not necessarily impact upon me, or vice versa. It may be no harm for objectors to state whether they have a vested interest or various prejudices. I realise that no one likes to disclose their personal dealings or status. It might be no harm to do so, however, because we often encounter a strong pressure group that may be orchestrated by a few people with a strong vested interest. Their interest may not be in the common good, although they are perfectly entitled to defend it. If politicians and developers are upfront, the people who will take a court process or meet the authority should have to outline any conflict of interest — that may be a strong term to use — or vested interest. I am not trying to nail them to the wall. It is just that everybody needs to be on an equal footing.The Bill refers to a court seeking an undertaking for damages. My colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, expressed some reservations about this but I think there is some merit in this proposal. I would like to see balance but I do not like the concept of people going to court at every hand's turn on the basis that they will get away with it because it is for the common good. They may gain some notoriety but, ultimately, the public will have to pick up the bill. The proposal is not a bad idea, but we do not want to make it prohibitive for someone to take court action if he or she needs to do so.The Minister said that we have spent €24 billion since 2000 on economic and social infrastructure. I assume that includes grants for child care.

We are all familiar with the Cavan joke: "€3,000 for me, €3,000 for you and €3,000 for the project." Whether they are large or small, projects always seem to cost the State a lot more money to carry out than the private sector. We must ensure that value for money is achieved by setting targets and penalty clauses.The Minister referred to the spatial strategy and getting our road network right. While I do not wish to score political points, the spatial strategy has been somewhat like the decentralisation programme — a little bit for everybody in the audience. The only way the spatial strategy will work is if we develop and build up a few areas, such as Galway being the western hub and Cork the southern hub. The country is too small to have 20 or 30 areas identified as centres in the spatial strategy. Decentralisation will work if a critical mass is achieved. In that way, there will be no difficulty with promotion or people changing jobs. One can see it working in private industry where it is difficult to get a company to locate in peripheral areas, irrespective of what grants are in place. Such companies do not have access to the human resources they require more than anything else. We need to go back to the drawing board in this regard.The Minister referred in his speech to bad planning applications, which are a hobby-horse of mine. Perhaps we should set up a website called ratemyagent.ie. When the Minister sits down at home at the weekend and is thinking of things to do, he might consider drawing up a guide for local authorities to hold a day-long seminar for agents and show them how to go through the process. We all know that if we see the name of a certain agent on a file, that file will cause trouble for the planner, the agent, the applicant and us, the public representatives. We should streamline the work of agents and let them know what is required with regard to basic practice, because this is a problem we encounter every day.The Minister spoke about restructuring An Bord Pleanála. I presume this section will deal exclusively with the major infrastructure projects. The Minister should not be afraid to be flexible if the restructuring is not working. When the Eastern Regional Health Authority was broken up into three areas, speakers in the House agreed this would be great for delivering services to the people, but it turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. If the Minister finds the new structure of the board is not working, he should not be afraid to change it. He could perhaps include in the Bill a process of re-evaluation after 12 or 24 months to ascertain how the new structure is working and, if necessary, make changes.The issue of electrical transmission lines has caused much difficulty for landowners, particularly in recent times, given current concerns and guidelines not to site residents within a certain distance of transformers. I know individuals who have suffered on their home land. There should be greater communication between the ESB and residents. In a recent example, foreign workers for the ESB who spoke no English arrived to carry out work at a site. When a local resident who knew nothing of what was happening went to ask them what they were doing in his field, he could not communicate with them.The Minister referred to gas pipelines. Chemical or pharmaceutical plants have a water outlet through which they dispose of water into the normal watercourse. In other countries, a system operates whereby the water outlet is upstream of the inlet. We should consider including this measure in our planning law because it would put an onus on the operators of factories to ensure that the water going through the outlet is clean because they would later reuse the water.I agree with the concept of including the private and public sectors, although the spokesperson for my party had reservations in this regard. The private sector should have access to this process as well as the public sector.The Minister referred to the implementation of Transport 21. I hope he will use his influence so the upgrade of the N81, as outlined in Transport 21, is carried out. It does not have to be complete before May 2007 but it should be carried out as soon as possible. Perhaps the project should be extended a little southwards.

When the Minister is drawing up the guidelines, he should consider introducing a regulation whereby if something is removed illegally, it will hinder a planning application for a number of years afterwards. People remove trees which they should not remove simply to facilitate planning applications. Perhaps a measure could be introduced in this regard.Reports on files should be sent to applicants or their agents once completed. I do not know why they are kept secret. To have them sent would make life easy for us.The Minister will be familiar with my final point. In the past few days I have come across three objections to planning applications. The NRA objected to one because the application is on a national road. In the second case, the local council objected because it claims the application is on a regional road. The third case involves An Bord Pleanála which knocked a planning application because it is on a country road which is too narrow. This drives the Minister, the public and me mad.I wish the Minister well with the Bill. There will be much work on it on Committee Stage rather than on Second Stage.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	497	This is a timely discussion which provides an opportunity to speak not just about critical infrastructure and the deficits therein but also about the issue of planning in general. In recent times we have gone through a Celtic tiger boom and significant resources are available to address our critical infrastructural deficit. However, there is no doubt deficits exist in transport, including public transport, roads, water, sewerage, ports, airports and so on. It is timely that the Bill is brought forward and, although it should have been brought forward some time ago, I accept the Minister has brought it forward as quickly as possible. Despite several years of boom, roads, sewerage, incineration and landfill projects have been delayed because of the inadequate planning process available to local authorities and the State to address the current deficit.Compared to other countries, it is only in recent years that we have had the wherewithal to address the infrastructure deficit. Even so, we are incapable of bringing forward projects as is done in other countries. I am at a loss as to why we must consult to such an extent local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and the courts with regard to major projects. I hope the Bill will address this issue.Incineration is an emotive issue. Politicians of all persuasions have a responsibility to address the problems of waste and waste management. While we may differ on how we approach it, whether through the use of landfill, reuse and recycle, which we all support, incineration or other forms of waste management, one thing we cannot continue to do is export our waste to other countries. We must be serious in ensuring that we are competitive in the world market and that we bring forward a proper waste management strategy. The Minister has explained this issue in detail but members of other parties and local authorities are still not supportive and do not buy into the idea of having to address the problems of the State.Everywhere one goes, if a landfill is proposed by a local authority, objections can be guaranteed, and rightly so. However, there must be an end-point to the objections process so the project can go ahead. In recent times, due to the ability of contractors and developers to move ahead expeditiously with construction, the slowest part of a project often has not been the construction but the process to approve the construction. In the case of a road project, a local authority working as an agent for the NRA will come forward with proposals. This will be followed by public consultation, appeals to An Bord Pleanála and environment impact statements before the process heads for the courts. There is a continual series of hurdles for any agent intending to progress a critical infrastructural development. Therefore, the Bill is welcome and timely.I welcome the provisions with regard to wind and wave energy. We must bring forward guidelines on wind energy. We have "The wind that shakes the barley" but we do not have the ability to erect turbines to harness the wind energy that passes over our country. At the same time, we are heavily dependent on fossil fuels — this issue was raised recently in the House — and import up to 90% of our energy needs. This will not be sustainable in the future as fossil fuels are not finite and their supply is dependent on political concerns, regional conflicts and imports.In the context of addressing our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, we are obliged to reduce greenhouse emissions. We will be obliged to get serious about wind and wave energy. We speak about biofuels and ethanol production from crops, oilseed rape, beet and wheat, and we must be progressive and should pioneer the development of wind and wave energy. However, we have been lax and have reneged on our responsibilities to the current generation, which should be given a head start in the context of addressing the problems of fossil fuel shortages and the increasing costs of energy.We are still building housing stock and while it meets requirements relating to insulation and building materials, it does not address the issue of inclusion of solar power and other forms of energy that can be harnessed. We will be obliged to take action in respect of that issue as a matter of urgency. We are building 70,000 to 80,000 units per year but solar panels are not in place on the vast majority of roofs. That is a dereliction of duty on the part of local authorities and the Oireachtas in not ensuring that these issues are to the fore.Reference was made to the cost of projects. Recent history indicates that the cost of projects relating to the construction of major roads has not been low. Objections were raised in respect of road projects relating to the Glen of the Downs, the M50 at Carrickmines and, on foot of the existence of a rare snail, the Kildare bypass. One must inquire about the motivation behind those objections. Was it love of the environment or rare snails or was it some form of ad hoc political movement trying to slow down the process by making objections for the sake of doing so? I hope the Bill can address that issue and give people who have bona fide concerns about developments in their areas, public representatives and local authorities the opportunity to meet representatives of the strategic planning section of An Bord Pleanála. Not everybody who has a concern can be tarnished as a crank objector. There are many genuine cases but at the end of the day a decision must be made so that the process can move forward.If we can reduce the number of crank objectors and commercial objections, that should be done. Deputy Timmins referred to people who have an interest. It is almost a criminal offence for people to use community associations or individuals to object to particular developments, strategic or otherwise, on purely commercial grounds. That is an issue that will have to be examined. It is difficult to prove whether a person is a bona fide objector or is objecting primarily for commercial reasons. Those who object for purely commercial reasons must be weeded out.There is no doubt that projects have been delayed as a result of objections. That someone can delay a project for six months or a year by objecting to the local authority or An Bord Pleanála for purely commercial reasons is an affront to the basic principles of planning law.We must adopt a serious approach in respect of communications masts. Every so often difficulties arise in local authority areas or in the constituencies of Oireachtas Members on foot of the erection of communications masts and the concern among members of the public that emissions from such structures can cause cancer or other illnesses. We must be responsible and accept the advice of world authorities on these issues and use that advice, as opposed to people's fears, as the benchmark for adjudicating on issues. The guideline that masts should not be erected near centres of population, schools, hospitals and so on is positive. As technology improves, I have no doubt that such masts could be situated even further away from areas of population and, in particular, from schools, hospitals and areas in which there are large concentrations of younger people. That is an issue about which many people in the Minister's constituency and every other constituency are concerned. People's fears are often fuelled, motions are tabled and rational thinking goes out the window. The reason there is much irrational thinking on this matter is that people have fundamental concerns about it. We should have proper guidelines and use the findings of the World Health Organisation and any other reputable bodies as the benchmark for health and safety issues.In regard to the fixed price contract, there are two problems. We have all heard of the waste of public funds on certain projects. Often that is not correct. A project may be initiated and a cost projection made in respect of it. By the time it goes through the local authority, an environmental impact assessment, An Bord Pleanála, the courts and further environmental impact studies, the inflationary costs of construction have increased. Additions are frequently made to projects. If a project comes in on time, those involved should be applauded. Not everybody in the House will applaud a project that comes in on time but if there is a perceived overrun, people will use it as an excuse to refer to the waste of public money. The cost of a project is often based on figures drawn up previously.I wish to refer to Cork City Council's development of a new waste water treatment system, which has transformed the quality of life. When initiated, it was costed at £80 million. It went over budget on a number of fronts, however, primarily because by the time it reached the construction stage, prices had increased. There were also other reasons that it went over budget. In genera,l there is a recognition that fixed-price contracts must be introduced in respect of large infrastructural developments because the incidental and extra costs that developers and contractors can impose on the State are unacceptable. I am glad they have come into being.Reference was made to Transport 21 and the national spatial strategy. Decentralisation is a positive development and should be encouraged. In the main, those who have been decentralised and who have moved voluntarily have found it a positive experience. The decentralisation programme should be encouraged and those who have volunteered should be moved as quickly as possible. If people have a positive experience, I genuinely believe that others will sign up. There is a life for people outside Dublin. There are positives in the context of rearing families, people's quality of life, the availability of open spaces and less traffic. Decentralisation is, therefore, a positive development and should be encouraged.A major problem exists at local authority level. Every few years, the planners and those in management get together to formulate county development plans. In my opinion, the elected members of local authorities are, in many cases, merely there to rubber-stamp measures. The reason for this is that they do not have access to expertise in their own right. Those proposing the plan, namely, the planners and the manager, present it to the councillors who, in the main, are not experienced in the field of planning, adjudicating on zoning and the further development of an area. A fund should be put in place from which the various party groupings can access money to bring in outside consultants to provide professional opinions rather than their being obliged to accept the opinions of planners and managers. If the planners are those proposing the plan, it is farcical that the councillors are obliged to take the advice of the proposers in any development plan. If we are serious about developing our towns and cities in a cohesive and planned manner, local authority members must be given access to resources to adjudicate on the decisions and recommendations made by planners. This is a serious issue. I sat on a local authority and at the end of the day one was told the planners and the management recommend it, and the threat always was that there would be legal implications. That puts the fear of God in local authority members.I propose that at a certain point, when a development plan is being formulated, a certain compulsory provision of funding be made available by the local authority to parties of various groupings and sizes so they can bring in an eminent outside body with expertise in the area to give them a flavour what the planners and management are proposing and decipher the jargon often put before them. I hope the Minister will look at that favourably.I am not denigrating planners. They are all honest people of high integrity, and they work judiciously. However, if they are planners, how did they never foresee this increase in our population? How is it they never zoned enough land to address the shortage? As sure as night follows day, and a county development plan is approved, planners immediately return with variations because of the shortage of land. Surely planners should be planning well in advance. By the time many local authorities have passed their county development plans, the plans are out of date and they have not got sufficient access to development land to alleviate the burden on young people trying to purchase houses.We can talk on an on about housing but one of the major cost components in a house is the price of land. There are labour and material costs, but to build a house is a very expensive undertaking. It is causing great hardship for many young people. In some areas of Cork, one can purchase a site for one house for up to €300,000, before one puts a block on it. That is entirely unacceptable. Even in large-scale developments, the "stand" to build a house can sometimes be up to €60,000 or €70,000 per unit, in high density areas. That is not acceptable. There is talk of developers hoarding land banks and having racked up large areas of land. Even if they have done so, the planners should be in a position to figure out in the future what will happen down the tracks with regard to demographics, population changes, the dynamics of work, and where people travel to and from. Planners have not been to the fore in addressing land shortage problems.I know the Minister will have some sympathy for my proposal that local authorities would have access to outside professional assistance when drawing up county development plans. It is not in the context of this Bill, but we are still talking of infrastructure and housing developments, and they are inter-related.I welcome the announcements on rural planning guidelines. While we have many quangos and other bodies adjudicating, it might at times be no harm to have an independent body which could check if local authorities are implementing Government policies as outlined in this House. This body would not check cost over-runs, as the Comptroller and Auditor General does, but would see if policy was being implemented in the manner we propose, just as the Bill before us, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill, will put in place a section of An Bord Pleanála.However, who will ensure those board members are doing their job properly, that they are meeting the guidelines? For years, An Bord Pleanála has told us it was inundated with planning applications and said it was not able to meet the guidelines. In the end it would send out for additional information and perhaps delay matters for another two months. We then return to this House and give the board more resources, and the same racket starts again. I am not saying the board is not snowed under with work, but there should be some way of ensuring its work is monitored and that its members are doing their work as they were encouraged to do by the Houses of the Oireachtas.With regard to pre-planning and consultation, communities certainly have some difficulties and concerns with some infrastructural developments, including landfills, incinerators, gas stations and a myriad of other projects. A community gain should be involved in such projects. I was once involved in a situation where a particular infrastructural development was going on in my constituency. Though it was unpopular, I supported it because it was in the interests of the common good. This was the sewage treatment plant in Little Island. I supported that development while most others objected to it. It was the right thing to do, and it would now be difficult to find anyone in Cork city to say otherwise. However, some local residents, neighbours and friends were objecting to the scheme.I try to encourage local authorities to ensure some community gain will ensue. There has been a little gain, but I fear that once a development goes ahead, the commitment to the community gain weakens dramatically. I was seeking community playing pitches and a walkway, and while some provision has been made, there should be proper monitoring to ensure this part of the deal is also honoured and the commitments adhered to. That is an issue on which I feel strongly. Some politicians support an issue which is unpopular, and all of a sudden the local authority promises various things. The development then goes ahead, but the community gain goes out the window. There must be a follow-up to ensure there are conditions so that when planning is granted and progresses the conditions regarding community gain are adhered to in tandem, or as quickly as possible thereafter. The Minister will have noted such promises of landscaping, pitch developments and walkways, which have never been fulfilled.I commend the Minister and I know he understands the difficulties. With the resources available to the State, we must use this opportunity to ensure we have a proper infrastructural development in the future which can serve the needs of the economy now and the generations ahead.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	498	I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on this important Bill. I welcome it and its primary purpose, the introduction of a streamlined planning consent procedure for strategic infrastructural developments. The commitment to streamline the consent procedure for vital infrastructural development has not come before time. While acknowledging the rapid pace of economic development and expansion that has taken place in Ireland in the past 15 years, there is no escaping the fact that our infrastructures have sadly lacked behind and has not kept pace with development as the country progressed. Citizens are still expected to travel on trains which would not be out of place in some of our museums. Some of the trains travelling on our tracks across the country are in very poor condition. Trains are so antiquated that to exit them, one must open the windows and attempt to open the door from the outside, no doubt like our forefathers in past centuries.Our railway infrastructure is also failing in terms of meeting people's travel needs. Nobody can dispute that rail travel in this country is very expensive in European terms. People pay up to €30, €40 and €50 for a ticket and stand all the way to Dublin. As well as being uncomfortable, this is very unsafe. I have heard of this happening routinely, particularly on Sunday evenings, when those who board trains at stations from Portlaoise onwards are often left standing between carriages as far as Dublin. This is disgraceful and shameful, particularly when people are paying such money. On parts of the Continent, in France in particular, passengers are assigned seats when they buy their train tickets, a simple, straightforward and fair process. Why can this not be implemented here? Is it because we are happy to let people pay the full price for a ticket but be denied a seat on the train? Attempts to introduce new trains recently met with strike action. This has not inspired people as to the future or reliability of rail travel. Embarrassing infrastructure deficits such as the lack of rail links to the main airports must be urgently addressed. Those forced to travel by road to Dublin Airport must face the traffic chaos caused by the Dublin Port tunnel works which frequently reduce traffic flow to a snail's pace. When one eventually reaches the airport, it is difficult to find car parking. These infrastructure deficits have created a farcical situation. Visitors arriving in the State are amazed at the traffic jams they meet once they leave Dublin Airport. A poor infrastructure compounds the problems associated with overcrowded buses. Rush hour in Dublin is a nightmare for bus passengers with buses crawling along stuffed to capacity with weary commuters. These people pay their taxes and deserve a better service.Outside Dublin we often see the traffic consequences of unsafe roads when accidents occur. The Government belatedly recognised the importance of seat belts on school buses in saving lives. It is time to prioritise the health and safety of our citizens. The Government holds the taxpayers pennies in some areas while throwing away good money after bad on vanity projects and poorly planned fiascoes like electronic voting. The school bus fleet is in a poor state. I recently tabled a parliamentary question on the school transport fleet. The response from the Department was that it did not know what the school transport situation was in south Tipperary. This is appalling when one considers the horrific crashes in other areas.The necessity for this legislation is evidenced by the fact that our road network remains light years behind that of Germany and other European countries. The Cork-Dublin road, for example, is a joke. Vital bypasses at Cashel and Kildare have shifted the traffic chaos to other towns such as Abbeyleix and Mitchelstown, creating bottlenecks there. The slow pace of roadworks is making life difficult for drivers on this road. In parts of counties Kildare and Dublin, roadworks slow traffic to 60 km/h for several miles, frustrating and beleaguering drivers.As a public representative pressing for more enterprises to locate to south Tipperary, I find the poor infrastructure there often undermines attempts to make a positive case for the region. While highlighting the presence of a talented and willing workforce, I cannot argue that the area has a good road and rail network or universal availability of broadband. Failure to address these issues is disadvantaging many rural areas. This is a critical time — while the economy is booming — to provide this infrastructure. Investors still consider Ireland a sound economic base. Failure to implement vital infrastructure developments urgently will create an impediment that rural Ireland will find hard to overcome. I hope the Bill will go a long way to address the lack of infrastructural developments hampering the economic potential of the regions.The Bill has not come before the House too soon. The potential to fast-track vital infrastructure projects is an important provision, particularly for road and rail projects. I welcome the provision which allows for an environmental assessment. Sensitivity must always be shown to the environment. We do not want a repeat of the disastrous destruction of much of Georgian Dublin which happened during another progressive era. The health and safety of the citizens must be of paramount importance when considering new projects, particularly with incinerators, which are provided for in the Bill. People are extremely fearful of the health risks associated with incineration. Their concerns cannot be brushed aside. It was proposed to locate an incinerator in the Tipperary South constituency. People did not know if an incinerator could damage their health. There were large public meetings in the county on the matter. The health issue surrounding incinerators must be addressed. The same is true with mobile telephone masts. As one of the most controversial issues hitting every Member's desk, it too needs to be addressed.I welcome the provision to fast-track wind farm development. A key cornerstone of the Fine Gael Party's environmental policy is the commitment to ensuring one third of the State's electricity will be generated from renewable energy sources in 20 years. It is vital we reduce our dependency on oil in this area. Wind farms are one mechanism to allow us achieve this.The Bill alone will not eradicate delays in vital infrastructure projects. The long delays precipitated by the courts which can add a further two year delay to a project must be addressed. Two individuals involved in the planning process with whom I spoke regarding the Bill claimed it allowed for acres of work for lawyers. This could lead to a desperate situation. It is vital the Bill is not stuck in the High Court.I note the allocation of €251,000 to An Bord Pleanála for it to develop a new strategic infrastructural division with ten staff. Will this small amount of money and low staff allocation be sufficient? The example of the Private Residential Tenancies Board does not inspire confidence. While a board arbitrator must deliver his or her judgment in a fortnight, there is a backlog of at least two months in sending out results. If that is the case, it is ridiculous and the matter needs to be addressed.There will be an ever increasing number of planning cases sent to An Bord Pleanála. Due to the guidelines, particularly those for one-off houses, people who are unhappy will appeal to An Bord Pleanála and the board will be increasingly busy as a result. It is important the board be given proper resources.On another issue relating to An Bord Pleanála and its members, it is vital that local authority representatives, whether councillors or persons with a good knowledge of the running and workings of local authorities, be made members of the board of An Bord Pleanála. That is a proposal the Minister, Deputy Roche, should consider seriously. Such persons have vast experience and have spent years dealing with planning issues. They have dealt with such matters from the start and have considerable experience, and there is a sound case to be made for their inclusion on the board. I ask the Minister to examine that important matter.The Bill will rightly not cover shopping centres or office block developments. The main idea behind the provision is that it is seen to be fair, open and transparent. This is vitally important. My party supports this completely because too much to do with planning has been hidden in the past. Any of us who were members of local authorities will recall that one recurring difficulty in planning was what was said and what was seen to be done. There is a need to be open and transparent about every aspect of planning because it involves considerable sums of money, land changing hands and developers. It is vital that everything is transparent and open.The need to deal with rogue developers is another issue every Member hears raised. Every Member of this House and every local authority member is concerned that there are still cases of unfinished housing estates. I recently saw two developers working side by side in a town. One of them opted for phased development of housing in his large estate of almost 100 houses. It was well planned. The first ten were built, gardens were laid out and roadways were put down, and then they moved along to the next phase. The other developer built all his houses, sold them all and left the roads potholed. It is deplorable that anybody should be allowed do that. The Minister must control such rogue developers. They are making significant profits. They have benefitted considerably over the years. They have buckets of money. They charge exorbitant prices for houses. That is another area at which the Minister needs to look.Planning presents challenges at local level. All rural based Deputies will be aware of the need to simplify the planning process in rural areas. Most people feel totally lost when it comes to the planning application process and are heavily reliant on public representatives to help them negotiate the complex procedures. Anyone looking at any of the local authority websites will see the amount of planning applications which are being made without public representatives, and sometimes these people go to two, three or four public representatives. The waste of time involved for local authority officials alone must be considered. Most of the planning applications that these people so badly need in rural areas would not be approved only for the guidance of local public representatives.It is important that all this is taken into account. There is still frustration with the rural housing guidelines among many people looking to build houses. When all these new highways, such as those from Dublin to Cork and Galway to Waterford, are built to take the extra traffic, there should be some leniency in allowing people access onto some of the roads which link towns and which then may not be as busy. The NRA is the party objecting to such people building houses onto those roads. The Minister should re-examine the matter. The quality of life in rural Ireland is second to none and we should allow our people to live there. Such objections are grossly unfair. I acknowledge that the Minister has been pro-active on this issue but problems still remain. There are people still being refused planning permission day in, day out.On a point Deputy Kelleher mentioned earlier, there is a considerable discrepancy in the advice of planners and architects employed by planning applicants. Their advice is not good and the Minister should insist that these fellows be made undertake an examination on the county development plans because there are a considerable number of them charging thousands of euro and they are not even familiar with the county development plans.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I wish to share time with Deputy Blaney.I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I have only one reservation and the Minister knows what it is because I spoke to him about it, that is, that unfortunately he cannot include the M3 in this legislation. Anyone who travels through County Meath, and on into counties Cavan, Leitrim, Donegal, Fermanagh and parts of counties Tyrone or Armagh, who must travel through towns such as Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells, will be aware of the amount of time spent sitting in the car in queues of three and four miles. One could encounter a queue of three miles at Dunshaughlin, a queue of two miles at Navan and a queue of two to three miles, and sometimes four miles, approaching Kells. That is not fair, either on business people or commuters. It is not warranted and it is not acceptable.Last week the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, visited my town of Kells. I travelled with him and we could not go through either of the towns on the way. We had to take the county roads to get to Kells on time, which is what people are doing day in, day out. Unfortunately, all of the county roads on both sides of the M3 are in a deplorable state but this is not due to a lack of funding because I am aware the former Ministers, Deputy Noel Dempsey and Deputy Cullen, and the current Minister, Deputy Roche, have given Meath County Council significant funding. When large articulated trucks and an enormous amount of cars use all of these roads which were never build for such traffic, naturally they will deteriorate.Last week the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, visited the enterprise board and the business park in Kells and was most impressed by what he saw. However, in his speech to the enterprise board he spoke of the importance of good infrastructure into any county or town, and that when industrialists come to locate in any town they look at the infrastructure and if it is good, naturally they will decide to locate there. That is why it is so important that roads such as the M3 are built.Even at this late juncture, I appeal to those people, most of whom are not from the locality or even from this country, who are delaying these projects by appealing them from one stage to the next. As it went through the planning process, the hearings on the M3 were the longest in the history of the State. Following this, the case went to the High Court and is now being appealed to the Supreme Court. When it is lost there, those to whom I refer have bragged that they will take it to the European Court of Justice. At the same time, the town of Kells, where my office is located and where I can be found every day of the week that I am not present in the Oireachtas, is being choked with traffic.As the Minister is aware, the situation in the area is unique in that the N3 and the very busy N52 pass through the town. Much of the traffic that comes from the north, south and west across Kells is comprised of heavy articulated trucks. We have received the go-ahead for the M3 and the bypassing of Kells, which will take traffic from the N52 away from the town.The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, is present. He recently visited Kells with me and saw how bad the situation has become. We met a few groups in Kilskyre where I grew up. Deputy Penrose would know the area well.

That will indicate how important the M3 is to us. Some people are not concerned about the industrial development of County Meath. Neither are they concerned about the commuters who travel through the area every day. All they want is to take care of the frogs, the snails and whatever else.We do not want to see our heritage destroyed. The Government — I am sure any Administration would do likewise — has invested enormous sums to ensure that archaeological digs take place. A significant number of archaeologists were employed to examine the area from the start of the M3 in Clonee to the far side of Carnaross on the Cavan border. Nothing will be destroyed. I cannot understand why these individuals are trying to stop progress and deprive the people of counties Meath and Cavan and parts of Deputy Penrose's county, which I also represent, who will avail of the M3 near Clonmellon and Fore, of a proper road network. Those to whom I refer should cop on and allow progress so that the people of County Meath and the adjoining counties can travel without encountering the blockages that currently exist.Deputy Hayes referred to planning in rural areas. That may not come within the remit of the Bill——

He referred to four or five politicians being lobbied with regard to the building of one-off houses. It is sad when this happens. I am not afraid to say that I support the right of people who were born and bred in rural areas to be allowed to live there. I am sure every other rural Deputy who wants to see rural areas kept alive feels the same.I do not apologise to anyone for fighting the case of young couples that find themselves in this situation. I am proud to be able to say that only for me, or some other politician — sometimes three or four can be involved — such young couples would not be living where they do, they would be obliged to live in towns. It is sad that when young couples obtain sites from relatives at no cost or at reduced rates, the planners place them in situations where they are obliged to pay €100,000 or €150,000 for such sites. That is most unfair. We should do everything possible for these people.If our planners and officials used common sense, planning would not be in the state in which it is today.
#NiallBlaneyIND	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-party	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-dob	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I thank Deputy Brady for sharing time. I sympathise with him in respect of the difficulties he faces with the M3 because we face similar difficulties with the N2 and the N2-A5. One way in which the process could be fast-tracked is that when the Bill is enacted, we could collectively promote the development of a motorway somewhere in between both roads that would take the traffic from the N2 and N3. That could represent the way forward. It may be an issue for another day but it is worth considering.I welcome the Bill. All associated with it are to be praised for bringing it into being. I do not think that any Member is unaware of the difficulties experienced in the past with infrastructural projects. We all experience them in our constituencies. Problems have occurred with electricity supplies in parts of County Donegal.Some of my comments may be considered over the top. I have difficulties with the powers allocated to the board of An Taisce, some of which relate to local planning issues but which should be tackled in the context of the Bill. Some members of An Taisce are in a position to abuse their authority in regard not only to infrastructural projects but also to local planning issues. Somebody will have to take the bull by the horns in regard to An Taisce. I will return to this matter in due course.I welcome the inclusion of the views of county councillors. We have heard a great deal about the removal of powers from county councillors. It is only right that the views of county councillors are recognised and that they are allowed to make recommendations to An Bord Pleanála because nobody knows more about views on the ground than they do. We do not make sufficient use of local authority members. I am glad the Minister has taken this step.I am also pleased with section 9, which deals with rogue developers. Everyone here recognises the importance of developers in our current economic boom. Unfortunately, we must also deal with rogue developers who were, possibly, not dealt with in the past. I can point to developments in my county of Donegal where non-compliance is evident. This involves matters such as linking lighting in housing estates to houses rather than linking it up properly. It is only right that where developments are not put in place in accordance with planning permission, other planning permissions sought by that developer should be withheld until the planning permission and conditions relating to other estates on which they are working are complied with.I also favour the section on community gain. It is only right that where a community could, or will, be put out by a development, An Bord Pleanála can make recommendations whereby a community gain can be obtained. Various Deputies have referred to rail and motorway projects. I look forward to the day we can discuss rail services and a motorway in Donegal. I hope these provisions will be included in the new national development plan, which is just around the corner. The Bill will be very helpful in respect of this.The Minister has done a good job on this Bill. However, I would like to see him take the next step and introduce a Bill which would deal with local planning issues. I spoke earlier about the undemocratic voice of An Taisce, which has too much influence on An Bord Pleanála. I am aware that An Bord Pleanála will always refer to their statistics and that it heeds so many of An Taisce's objections but we can never obtain any figures relating to these objections. All or most of the cases in Donegal are being overruled. We must bring forward a Bill which will not allow An Taisce to appeal decisions to An Bord Pleanála. An Taisce is abusing its powers at the moment and should only be allowed to make recommendations to the board. I look forward to the day when An Taisce is stripped of its right to make objections to An Bord Pleanála and may raise the issue in this House as often as necessary. I welcome the Bill and look forward to its passing.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill. My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, set out the Labour Party's broad views on the matter. My views may not be shared by everyone. This Bill will fundamentally change our country's planning laws and some people argue this change is not for the better. Section 3 effectively provides that major construction projects, including private projects, can be built without going through the normal planning process. These projects include waste incinerators, chemical treatment plants, major landfills, oil refineries, large oil and gas storage tanks, oil and gas pipelines, wind farms, electricity pylons, airports, seaports, railway stations and many other similar projects, which are all contained in the Seventh Schedule to the Planning Act. Under the Bill, there will be no right of appeal for these projects because they will be heard by An Bord Pleanála in the first instance.The Minister is correct in ensuring that certain projects, such as railways and certain roads, are fast tracked. However, I have deep reservations about letting proposals for waste incinerators go through to An Bord Pleanála without anyone having first call. Where concerns about health and safety in respect of certain projects exist, they must be recognised. In areas where the jury is out in respect of safety, we should ensure people's fears and concerns are assuaged by proper argument and by giving them the chance to participate.The Planning and Development Acts 1963, 1976, 1992, 1997 and 2000 have served us well. Deputy Blaney referred to the fact that in respect of prescribed bodies under Article 36 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, set out a considerable number of prescribed bodies, including An Taisce, and gave them locus standi. In respect of rural housing, An Taisce has intervened and made its stance known. These cases have sometimes involved people who have secured sites from their families.The basis of rural Ireland is the building up of communities. It is not right that An Taisce and similar bodies can impose their views on local people who are central to the building of communities and who may seek to build houses beside or close to the homes of their parents. The parents of some of these people may be living in rural areas with no public transport and may depend on their children or other relatives to transport them to major towns for medical and other important appointments yet objections to their children's proposed developments are still made.We have widened the idea of participatory democracy, a concept I favour. One of my reservations about this Bill concerns its restrictions on participatory democracy. The Bill is good in part but contains areas about which I have deep concerns. The Bill diminishes participatory democracy and the right of the public to object and effectively cuts local authorities out of the process. I note county councillors will be allowed to make submissions to An Bord Pleanála, which is useful because they have widespread experience of what is happening on the ground and reflect community concerns in a comprehensive way. Very often, members of local authorities have been written out of the script but it is important to recognise that they play a fundamental role in relaying the very real concerns of people.Participatory democracy is needed to allow people to have their say. This generally takes place through local authority members but individuals can also make their views known. Participatory democracy should be widened rather than restricted but it needs to be widened in a way that contains very detailed and prescriptive rules. A person must need substantive reasons and a substantive interest in order to make an objection. It is pushing things when someone from Donegal and Cork is allowed to intervene in a proposed development in Westmeath. With all due respect to the Minister of State, I would not like to object to a development in Cork. I have heard of people coming to Westmeath from as far away as Cork or Donegal to object to something which might be an essential part of the county's infrastructure. Such people decide it is their right to object to such developments and are given this right.The right to object should be reserved for people with substantial and material interests and who are in a position to make objections of a substantive, rather than a frivolous, nature. Other speakers have claimed certain individuals use others to make objections and that other individuals have a commercial interest in objections. Such activity should not be allowed. We should ensure such people are not granted locus standi to participate in the process. If the activity to which I referred is revealed at any time, it is a serious matter. Only people within a county who can prove they have substantive reasons and a substantial interest should be allowed to make objections.My concern with the Bill is that it diminishes people's rights to go to court. That right is limited in terms of judicial review, but I welcome that the Minister of State is taking on board some of the Labour Party's suggestions in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2005 to set up a designated court to deal with appeals from An Bord Pleanála on various projects. If there are appeals, it is important to examine them quickly in a court structure. It is also important that people's right to go to court is protected. Regarding the judicial review, the substantive interest has been set out. It is important to obtain finality on these matters because yo-yoing often occurs. These measures could ensure and preserve the right to object in planning processes.I am concerned by major landfills, chemical treatment plants, waste incinerators and developments of that nature, which are a bridge too far. I know why they are built and I understand why the Minister of State may say that local democracy is not working because people seem to be too nervous to take decisions. Nevertheless, this issue is being circumscribed. The health and safety of our citizens should be conserved in planning legislation.While many projects are required for the common good, a lot are developer-driven. I know of developers who do excellent work, employ people at the top rates, participate in Construction Industry Federation pension schemes and so on. While no one is entitled to tar people with the same brush, there are developers in every county who have let down their good colleagues. It was for this reason that we introduced the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2005. In that Bill, we indicated that the local authorities should have a legal right to refuse planning permission to developers that apply, under whatever guise — perhaps in the form of companies that have reformed — but that already hold planning permissions in adjacent areas or within the jurisdictions of those local authorities and have failed to complete housing estates or the other developments they may have undertaken and have not adhered to the specific terms of said planning permissions.It is amazing that one often sees local authorities taking action against persons who have built single houses in the countryside because their walls were not built the requisite three feet from the road, because they failed to remove trees and so on. However, there has been a certain tardiness in pursuing bad developers that have charged top dollar. The former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, informed the House about the rationale for reducing the capital gains tax rate from 40% to 20%, and stated that it would increase the supply of land and the number of houses and lead to a decrease in house prices. Instead, the bad developers grabbed everything, including the 20% in capital gains tax, which they put in their pockets. Some of them did not complete footpaths, roads, lighting or green areas. One could write a book about it.It is time to stop this conduct and, like every Member, I welcome the relevant measures in the Bill that will do so. We all have tales to tell in this respect. It is time to tell bad developers that they are besmirching everyone's name. There are many good developers who build the finest of houses. For example, one would be proud of certain areas in my county. However, there are areas where people have no lighting or roads, where sewerage systems have not been completed, where manhole covers are left open and so on. The developers in question get their money, only complete 80% or 85% of the projects and move on in the hope of grabbing the next shilling. They charge those young people who can put roofs over their heads €200,000, €250,000 or more for their houses.The Government must be criticised for its failure to implement the recommendations of the Kenny report, which has been lying around since the 1970s but about which action should now be taken. It is a scandal and a shame that young people who may have easily been able to put roofs over their heads at one time are no longer in a position to do so. As they are now our top candidates for social and affordable housing, we are increasing the pool of people who cannot provide for themselves. This is a failure of the Government.We should consider a windfall tax on developers who gain from zoning decisions. The price of €10,000 or €15,000 for agricultural land can be transformed into €200,000 or €250,000 at the stroke of a pen. High-density building takes place, but not a penny beyond the development charges levied by local authorities is returned to local people. The windfalls should be taxed because they are gained by virtue of the location of developments and the fact that local authorities deem the rezoning necessary. The location of the projects gives developers added advantages that are unavailable to ordinary working class people who do not possess property of any kind. There should be a windfall tax to ensure that money is ploughed into those communities adjacent to which new houses are built.Local authorities are notoriously remiss in that they allow haphazard developments to take place without providing the necessary infrastructure to accommodate traffic, public transport and schools or ensuring that the relevant Departments do so. Schools are particularly necessary if we are to ensure that young people do not need to wait in queues to obtain places when they reach four years of age.We are discussing infrastructure. The Government blames objectors for its ills, but it is often the Government's tardiness that is at fault. The Department of Education and Science is an example. In 2001, I was told at a famous meeting in Coralstown, which lies between Mullingar and Kinnegad, that its school would be built. Before the 2002 general election, a candidate who has since returned to the Dáil assured everyone that a school would be delivered. Like others, I lost many votes by telling the truth because I stated that the school would be delivered in 2007 or 2008. We are approaching June 2006 and a scraw has still not been turned. I suffered because I told the truth, but I believe in being up front with people rather than deceiving or misleading them.Some of the blame must be laid at the Department's door because projects go up and down through stages like a jigsaw. This nonsense should be stopped and the matter should be given to local management, which should be told that its job is to use the €500,000 or €600,000 provided. Designs for four-room schools, for example, should be standardised and adequate space should be provided. Even if there is a requirement to provide a certain number of square feet per pupil, the amount of square footage required in Louth cannot be different from that needed in Mullingar.The blame for delays can often be laid at the doors of Departments, which can slow down or accelerate projects for electoral advantage. A good example would be phase 2B of the hospital in Mullingar. Since 1997 there has been foot dragging over this very important infrastructural project. Lo and behold, with an election 12 months away, it is like watching hot air balloons, everything is rising. That breeds cynicism in the electoral process. Projects should be allowed as they are developed within Departments, with no foot dragging or questions being answered from the sides of mouths. I ask question after question in here and receive all sorts of pedantic answers when I know the truth.Often Departments must send everything out to contract. The Minister or the Minister of State will come down to open the link road to Mullingar with the chairman of the county council. The local authority employees did that job quicker and better than any of the contractors. It is about time we lifted the embargo on local authorities employing workers to undertake some of these projects. When local authorities take on projects, there are engineers overseeing every step of the way. There are very few extras or things done wrong. It is rare they would come looking for additional money during the variable contract stage.I am proud of the work by Westmeath County Council workers. The Department of Finance, however, had the audacity to tell local authorities not to take on such people. It would prefer contracts to go to the flash Harry who comes along and does the work without employing local labour. This was an excellent example, supervised by engineers for Westmeath County Council under the director of services Mr. George Lambden, of what can be done by local authority employees.We must examine this and ensure there is respect for a diversity of views. We cannot have a one size fits all solution in the planning process because it has caused problems in the past. I support rural people living in their own environment. Those who object have never had the opportunity to live in those areas. Rural people must be given a chance because they are the backbone of the local community, contributing to football and hurling teams, the church, schools, the post office and the Garda station. If An Taisce had its way, rural areas would have nothing but trees and bushes left, there would be no people and everyone would be concentrated in urban areas. Some young planners also have this view and are trying to adopt a European model that prevails in France and impose it on rural Ireland. They will not get away with it because we stand for rural Ireland.

This will improve our area and access to it. There were difficulties with the residents but they have now been resolved, an example of the significant benefits of cross-Border co-operation.During this debate, many Members will refer to critical infrastructure in terms of the railway service. Unfortunately, Donegal does not have a railway system but should we be in a position to be able to link the Derry service with that in Sligo — the campaign for the western corridor had been strong but did not appear to include Donegal — this legislation would ensure that issues can be expedited to either put tracks in place or reinstate existing tracks. I take this opportunity to ask the Minister for Transport to work with his counterpart in Northern Ireland to ensure that there will be a direct service from Derry to Dublin. There is no reason that this should not be the case because the track is available. It is not a matter of anybody needing to object; it is rather a matter of putting in place better quality track and running a train on it from start to finish.I acknowledge also that to leave Donegal to come to Dublin one must use either the M1 or the M2. I recognise the major improvements on the M1 and the significant improvements in respect of the M2. The opening of the bypass at Ashbourne has significantly helped areas such as Donegal but we deserve a motorway into the north west similar to those to Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Belfast. I hope that will be put in place in the near future but I accept that the major investment that has taken place has had a positive impact.I want to raise the issue of the local road infrastructure because, with the exception of a six-mile stretch, there is no primary or secondary road on the Inishowen Peninsula where I live. We are dealing, therefore, with county roads. When the former Deputy, Bobby Molloy, was Minister of State, he took away our local improvement scheme money because he said Donegal County Council, like some other councils, was spending it in a piecemeal fashion. We were then obliged to start spending it in a more coherent way.When it comes to investment in our major county roads network which comprises the Buncrana to Bridgend, Moville to Derry, Quigley's Point through Glentogher into Carndonagh routes and the Buncrana inner relief road — thankfully, the Carndonagh inner relief is well progressed — the Minister has visited Donegal and seen the situation at close hand. The LISs now get significant money but progress is unnecessarily slow and there should be a bigger injection of funds into the areas to which I refer, particularly those where there is no national primary or secondary road. The infrastructural investments should be skewed in favour of those areas in each council region to ensure the developments can progress faster than is currently the case.There are issues also regarding land acquisition. The process takes far too long. If we need the land, the process must be expedited, which is part of the purpose of this Bill. This legislation will have a positive impact in areas such as that which I represent.The same situation applies in respect of water and sewerage systems. We have difficulties in locating sites because, even though there is significant investment and the technology has moved on, people are objecting. I accept that in many cases there are genuine concerns. I accept also Deputy Penrose's point that we do not want people from outside coming into a local area and deciding policy and the way projects should progress. Local people should have an input in terms of what happens in their areas. By the same token, however, the bigger picture must be addressed.An issue that is very pertinent in my county is that of power and communications networks. We had many talks from the ESB warning us that if we were living in west Donegal, we could wake up some day and discover the we had no power and that we would need the extra support of another line. A balance must be struck between the right to express one's concerns and the right of people to have the basic infrastructure they require. There is a debate about mobile phone masts and inadequate coverage for mobile phones throughout the country. However, when we examine ways to improve those, there are more objections than there are people who support particular locations. We must find some mechanism to develop best practice and clear guidelines on what is acceptable and ensure that, in the initial phase, the applications being received are not off the wall, for want of a better phrase, but are in compliance with basic standards. This will ensure that, at the very least, people in a locality will be protected by appropriate guidelines and national and international best practice.Deputy Penrose referred to school infrastructure. A secondary school was recently built on the peninsula on which I live. The board of management involved and the parents' association challenged the Department of Education and Science to give them the money to build the school. They rose to that challenge and we now have a fine school. If people are prepared to meet the challenge, it is only right that they should be allowed to do so.I agree that the position in respect of education is changing. In terms of water and sewerage systems, however, the process within the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been slow. People are obliged to submit applications to their local councils and these are then vetted and passed back and forth. My most recent experience of that concerned the fire service but, thankfully, we have reached the stage where tenders have been accepted and a fire station to matched the excellent ones in Carndonagh and Buncrana will be built in Moville.On wind farms, I am in favour of renewable energy and I have no difficulty with land-based wind farms. In terms of wind energy potential, County Donegal probably represents one of the biggest possibilities in respect of the development of wind farms. I will sound like someone adopting a NIMBY attitude in putting this point — that is not my intention — but there was an option of putting a 30 turbine, 80 storey wind farm on the Foyle. I referred to examining guidelines and best practice but this is one of the last national fisheries in the country and possibly in Europe. One wonders about putting 30 wind turbines in a scenic area that has a wonderful natural fishery, when the best advice one can obtain from the company promoting it is that the smolts can swim around at the bottom of the river and it will be an attraction for anybody wanting to operate glass bottom boats. I know a great deal about fishing but I assume that if the smolts swim around a particular location, the bigger fish will soon catch on to what is happening and we might not have a natural fishery in the future.There is potential for hydroelectricity and tidal energy. There are projects that are less intrusive in certain locations and the type of project brought to a particular location should be in keeping with what that location can embrace. I speak as somebody who lives in a house overlooking wind farms situated on land. When we bring forward projects and before people object or otherwise, we should ensure the projects are in keeping with the location.An Bord Pleanála has made many important decisions. Most people will either strongly agree or disagree with those, but it does an important job. One of the difficulties is that it can take a long time for those decisions to be delivered and the speeding up of the process is important. It is vital that people have the ability to put their case but we must be able to proceed with considered haste rather than avoid reaching conclusions. It is possible to do both. We can speed up the process and ensure that decisions are taken and that cases do not drag on for years.In my experience in respect of some vital items of infrastructure, there have been cases where decades passed but projects did not advance.It is much better to cut to the chase. Deputy Penrose spoke of telling people the truth, regardless of whether they liked it or whether votes were lost. People appreciate it if others are straight with them. In the same spirit, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill must deliver a scenario in which people will have the right to air their views, positively or negatively, and which will bring about a resolution within a reasonable timeframe. Everyone will then know where they stand.Donegal is a county that is particularly in need of infrastructure. It relies heavily on the remainder of the country for its access, be it through rail, air or road infrastructure. It also relies heavily on Northern Ireland as its geographical hinterland to help it with access. I would like to think that the issue of the natural gas pipeline, which had been supported and developed from Belfast to Letterkenny — but which has stopped in Derry — will be reconsidered so that the critical pieces of infrastructure can be delivered.In our case, it will be delivered in the context of cross-Border co-operation. Similar to the ESB's involvement in the power station at Coolkeeragh in County Derry, these issues are out of the immediate and sole control of this particular jurisdiction. They rely on co-operation. I look forward to the time when the Northern Executive is up and running again. Our items of critical infrastructure can be planned and developed in a coherent fashion. Unfortunately, in County Donegal, in many instances we require the co-operation of the other jurisdiction. The most profitable development of such infrastructure can only be done with Northern politicians taking on the mantle of being the decision-makers and decision-takers, rather than abdicating the responsibility to people in Westminster or those in Scotland or Wales.It is time Donegal had the ability to develop in the same way as other places. This item of infrastructure legislation will help all parts of the country to develop their infrastructure. However, in some key areas we are reliant on matters outside our control. I hope, in that context, that the process currently under way and deemed to conclude by 24 November will be of assistance.I will return to a minor point of which I have been reminded, namely, the issue of trying to ensure that local people can have their families accommodated. With council development plans, we must be cognisant of the idea of the local. I am sure Members will be familiar with cases where somebody, perhaps a person from abroad who has a holiday home in which they reside for two weeks per year, will make an objection to An Bord Pleanála with regard to an individual who has already gone through the system and been deemed able to build on family land. An Bord Pleanála may have ruled against the person building their own home on their own land.It is a difficult balance between the right to object and the right for people to have their own family home. This also applies to people's right to object to critical items of infrastructure. Delays in respect of the latter can hold back towns, counties or, ultimately, the country from maximising their potential. There are probably positives and negatives for everybody in respect of the Bill and I am glad I had the opportunity to comment on it.

As a result, surgeons have no choice but to carry out radical mastectomies.

It disappoints me greatly that no progress has been made. The case for the north west having its own radiotherapy unit is much stronger than the case for the south east having such a unit, although the latter also has a strong case. That is the reality.There are major problems with the Bill. An entire tier of democracy is being removed from the system. There are large projects that are supposed to be for the common good. Even something of great social significance, namely, social housing, is omitted from the Bill.Another problem is that the Minister is seeding responsibility to An Bord Pleanála in respect of issues such as the compulsory acquisition of land for pipelines, etc. I wonder why that is the case. I am greatly concerned that democracy is being utterly eroded.In the Bill, one cannot identify what will profit enterprise and that which will lead to social development and benefit the common good. They are not the same thing. My worry is that the Bill is not what it claims to be. I am particularly concerned that the Minister is washing his hands of any future controversies relating to compulsory acquisition for pipelines, refineries etc.

#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	577	I wish to share time with Deputies Peter Power, O'Connor, Curran and Hoctor.I thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for bringing this Bill before the House. It gives us an opportunity to study the work the Courts Service board is doing in providing information on sentencing and the management information systems it has in place, particularly the criminal case management system, which is relevant to the Bill.No one can really argue with the principles which underlie Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill. It is not, however, the best way to achieve his objectives because the Courts Service board has the necessary capacity and has started work on the measures envisaged by the Bill. Everyone agrees that it is a good idea to have a comprehensive register of sentences so that sentencing norms can be assessed. Everyone can agree that it is a good idea to do something which introduces greater transparency to the sentencing process within the criminal justice system. For these reasons we must be careful that whatever we do in the sentencing area achieves these objectives.As the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said last night, we can all agree that few aspects of our criminal justice system generate as much controversy as the sentences handed down by our courts. We all know cases where the man in the street believes the sentence to be too lenient or, occasionally, too harsh. All Deputies have received letters from constituents complaining about court sentences. It is an issue that attracts comment on an ongoing basis.It is clear, however, that moves are afoot to address the sentencing issues raised tonight by the Opposition. I especially welcome the setting up of a high level steering committee by the Courts Service board to plan for and provide a system of information on sentencing. This will provide some systemic form of information as a reference point for judges. This system will be easily integrated into the information systems the Courts Service board operates efficiently, particularly the criminal case management system.I am aware that the steering committee has reviewed sentencing systems worldwide. This is a good approach because we should seek out best practice elsewhere, especially in countries with similar legal systems. I understand the committee has identified the sentencing regimes in Scotland and New South Wales as the most relevant to our situation. In this regard, New South Wales has a judicial commission whose major function is to assist the courts in achieving consistency of approach in the sentencing of offenders. The commission's objectives in this area are to reduce unjustified disparities in sentences imposed by the courts, to improve sentencing efficiency generally and to reduce the number of appeals against sentences, thereby releasing valuable resources which can be redeployed to reduce court delays.

#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	581	The commission has two strategies for achieving its objective of sentencing consistency, namely, providing judicial officers with access to the sentencing information system — a computerised sentencing database — and undertaking and disseminating original research and statistical analysis on aspects of sentencing and other topics of assistance to sentencers.I will deal with the Courts Service board and its information technology system, in particular the criminal case management system. It may be asked whether the Judiciary supports such a system, so I will read what the Chief Justice, Mr. John Murray, said: "The increasing demands made upon our legal system, whether manifested in the volume and level of complexity of proceedings initiated or in the expectations of the legal profession and litigating public, require that the service equip itself to discharge its functions by drawing upon the best management practices, availing of the latest technologies".The board has a criminal case management system, which had only been operational in Dublin and Limerick District Courts offices but was rolled out nationwide to 41 separate offices in 2005. The exercise represented the largest single implementation of a strategic business application in the history of the Irish courts system. The system can track the whole life cycle of a criminal or road traffic case, which means that an integrated electronic record is now available in respect of 95% of all criminal cases nationwide. That was not acknowledged in recent contributions to this debate.The system will also enable the service to introduce an automated penalty points system to meet its commitment to Government on the implementation of penalty points. It was necessary to ensure compatibility between the criminal case management system and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government driver licensing system so that the details of penalty point convictions could be electronically transferred to the Department for further processing. In addition, as part of a pilot project commenced during the year, details of summons applications from the Garda Síochána are electronically received and details of hearing dates electronically allocated. The installation of the criminal case management system represents a major challenge for the service. It included the introduction of a significant business change programme, as well as the training of almost 300 staff. The exercise was completed on time and within a demanding six-month period.It is necessary to integrate the system not just with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Garda PULSE system but also with the prison system and the probation service, and to have it fully on-line so that it is acceptable to all who require access to it.It is very interesting to see some of the figures from the criminal case management system. Much of what the Bill proposes is already in place. The 2004 figures report 312,152 summary cases in the District Court. As I said, the two areas originally on the system were Dublin and Limerick. Some 24% of assault and public order offences in Dublin were dismissed, whereas in Limerick the figure was only 9%. In Dublin, of the total number of assault and public order cases dealt with, 702, or 10%, were dealt with by the poor box system. In Limerick none was dealt with by the poor box. I do not know whether the people of Dublin are more affluent than the people of Limerick but I doubt it. Some 32% of drug offences dealt with in Limerick resulted in fines, as against 14% of drug offences in Dublin, which suggests Limerick has more affluent drug offenders. Some 15% of drug offences in Dublin were dismissed, as against only 4% in Limerick.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	586	Deputy Finian McGrath might like to visit Limerick as he would return more enlightened than he was last week when he made unfortunate comments to the media. That is, however, an issue for another day.I compliment Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on bringing the Bill before the House. While I and the Deputy do not agree on whether it will achieve its intended objectives, the Bill gives Deputies an opportunity to discuss the wider issue of sentencing, an important concern, and send a message to the Judiciary outlining the Legislature's views on its sentencing policy. Fewer subjects generate greater emotion than sentencing. All Deputies will be aware from meetings with constituents that people respond emotionally to sentences handed down by the Judiciary without knowing some of the mitigating or underlying factors of the cases in question. People will always have an opinion on whether an individual received too severe or too lenient a sentence. This highlights that lack of consistency in sentencing has become a major problem, which is bringing the law, courts and Judiciary into disrepute.The Bill also gives Deputies an opportunity to express our views on sentencing policy. The Judiciary has taken much too liberal an approach to sentencing. A person who, having taken alcohol, gets into a fight on a Saturday night and kicks another person in the head while lying on the ground should know before going out that such a crime will result in him or her spending a long period in custody. The House should send out a message that anyone who rapes or sexually assaults a woman, especially an under age girl, the issue which has dominated business this week, will spend an extraordinarily long time behind bars. Unfortunately, this is not the message being sent out by the Judiciary. If anything, this debate offers the House an opportunity to send this message to the Judiciary.While I welcome Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's initiative to deal with the underlying issues of transparency and consistency in sentencing, I understand a steering committee of the Courts Service is addressing these issues. Extensive research is being carried out nationally and internationally, including in Australia, New Zealand, the United States and England, to determine how the system can be made more consistent. Although the Bill strives to achieve greater consistency, it is probably premature to enact the legislation pending the outcome of the steering committee's deliberations. We should await its report before re-examining Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's proposals in light of its recommendations.Sentencing is a matter for the judge in the court and is, therefore, a subjective decision. The judge in each case must take all the circumstances into account. The information the Bill seeks to obtain from the Courts Service does not capture underlying factors such as background, motivation, previous history, provocation and so forth, none of which can be provided in the simple form sought in these proposals.In an ideal world we would have a sentencing register, notwithstanding the substantial resources which would be required to compile it. However, the House should first await the outcome of the deliberations of the Courts Service's steering committee before re-examining the Bill.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Nobody will disagree with the concept and principles underlying the legislation and all Deputies will agree in principle that it is a good idea to have a comprehensive register of sentences which would allow sentencing norms to be assessed, and that a measure which introduces greater transparency to the sentencing process in the criminal justice system is welcome. It is for these reasons that we must be careful that any action we take in the area of sentencing achieves its objectives.I support the steps being taken to remove some of the mystery of sentencing, as members of the public might regard it. Nevertheless, in approaching this issue, we must be careful to ensure we do not undermine fundamental principles which underpin our criminal justice system. While we all agree that more information on sentencing is required, the Bill as drafted presents certain problems. For instance, section 5(2) provides for the register to be updated weekly, but this requirement is not feasible because many sentences are subject to an appeal and, as such, months will elapse before certainty is established in particular cases. This example of a problem does not detract from the fact that the principles underlying the legislation are valid.The traditional approach to sentencing is that the Oireachtas lays down the maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to the maximum sentence. This approach reflects the doctrine of the separation of powers, with the Legislature laying down the possible punishment range and the courts deciding the punishment, taking into account all the circumstances of the case and the offender. While this system has served us well, like all systems it is not perfect. It is difficult to balance the rights of the accused and those of the victim in perfect harmony.No one has suggested replacing the current system with one in which all sentencing is determined by pre-established mandatory sentences. As I noted last week, mandatory sentencing is already in place in some areas, notably under section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 which relates to the misuse of drugs. A mandatory sentences of ten years' imprisonment, save in exceptional and specific circumstances, is in force for the possession of substantial quantities of drugs for the purpose of unlawful sale or supply where the value of the drugs exceeds €13,000. Unfortunately, many people share my view that this provision has not been properly enforced by the Judiciary. Until recent years, mandatory sentences were imposed in only 6% of these types of cases, a figure which has since increased to more than 20% but is still a minority of cases. Judges should resort to the exceptional circumstances provision in a minority of cases. We have a long way to go before the Judiciary has fully implemented the legislation on mandatory sentencing which we, as legislators and public representatives, believe to be appropriate.I note the Criminal Justice Bill before the House provides for mandatory sentencing for the possession of illegal firearms and other offences. Mandatory sentencing has little effect if it is the exception rather than the rule. The experience to date with this form of sentencing is that it has not delivered on the expectations of Members when they passed the relevant legislation.I welcome the initiative by the board of the Courts Service to establish a sentencing committee. It would be premature to move on this issue before it has concluded its deliberations. We can see then how best to advance this debate on the establishment of general sentencing information. I welcome the proposal and concur with its principle and concept, but the detail as laid out in this particular——

Together with other colleagues, I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate. I compliment Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, my esteemed colleague on the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for his work in this area. I was not going to get involved in the banter that took place between my Limerick and Dublin colleagues earlier, but as a proud Dubliner I will always speak up for the Dublin viewpoint. As Deputy Power mentioned Limerick, I will refer to Tallaght for a second, but only because in any debate like this I would wish to state what has been achieved there. One of the things we are happy about in Tallaght is the restorative justice programme, which has a sister programme in Tipperary. I am sure Deputy Hoctor will speak about that later. The Minister visited our community a couple of weeks ago for the annual report of the restorative justice programme in Tallaght, which is making huge progress. As Tallaght and Nenagh have shown the way, this programme can be rolled out in the rest of the country. That should be done.I am sympathetic to the Bill's intent but, like other colleagues, I believe we should await the outcome of the steering committee's work before considering legislation. We need information on sentencing and I suspect that some of the controversy which erupts from to time to time may be defused if we have recourse to a proper sentencing database. As we are discovering, sentencing is a complex issue. Each case is different with variable factors to be taken into account. While no two cases are the same, that is not to say that judges cannot make mistakes or that sentencing may not be consistent. For all these reasons we need more information on this vital function of the courts.I support the decision of the board of the Courts Service to establish a steering committee to plan for and provide a system of information on sentencing. I also welcome the committee's decision to establish a pilot project in the Dublin Circuit Court. Information is needed if we are to consider the issue meaningfully. We need to get beyond headlines. Once we have information we can consider the rights and wrongs of mandatory sentencing or sentencing guidelines. The real question is whether we should have statutory sentencing guidelines.As the Minister has stated, the complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission, which specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. The commission has stated that statutory guidelines would involve undue interference in the independence of the Judiciary. The decision on what kind of sentencing to impose is a judicial determination. Apart from exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentencing. I generally concur with the thinking behind the recommendations on statutory guidelines. The point was made in the commission's report that the more detailed the requirements of any statutory sentencing procedure, the more likely it was that mistakes would arise, leaving sentences open to challenge on technical grounds only.Subsequently, the working group on the jurisdiction of the courts found that there was a need for some system of objective guidance on sentencing for judges at all levels. One option proposed by the working group would be to accommodate within the present system the more effective dissemination of decisions which are regarded as being authoritative in nature, particularly decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. These benchmark cases would at the same time assist trial judges and enable the public to understand more clearly the principles behind sentencing decisions.I was interested to hear that the Courts Service and the Supreme Court Judiciary are currently operating a pilot database of judgments of the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal, which has been launched on the Courts Service website with High Court judgments.I concur with the Minister in that we should await the outcome of the steering committee's work. Future debate will be the richer for doing so. I look forward to voting for the Government amendment but I compliment Deputy O'Keeffe.

With my colleagues, I thank and commend Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for bringing this issue before us. Like Deputy O'Connor, I am a firm believer in the system of restorative justice. At a later stage, Deputy O'Keeffe is to bring before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights a report on the implementation of restorative justice in the Nenagh and Tallaght projects, as well as the experience abroad. When that report is made available we may have a different view of the Private Members' proposal before us. While I can see merits in what Deputy O'Keeffe is attempting to do with this measure, I can also see difficulties, which have no doubt already been outlined by my colleagues.A genuine effort has been made in the Bill to create a comprehensive register of sentences so that sentencing norms can be assessed. The measure also seeks to introduce greater transparency in the sentencing process. How we go about doing that is the key issue. Deputy O'Keeffe's proposal would appear to be difficult to implement and would entail a major undertaking for the Courts Service. It would not be practical even to record sentencing patterns on a weekly basis, which the Bill recommends. The complexity of the process would be seen as a vast drain on staff and resources. The timing is also a difficult aspect because each case is different.I commend the Deputy on what he is attempting to do but it would be difficult to implement in practical terms. The level of detail required with the labour intensity go far beyond what is needed. The proposal recommends that all details of previous sentences of offenders would be brought before the courts and that mitigating factors would be taken into consideration. All that data would have to be made available to the Courts Service staff who do not currently have it, although it is available to the Garda and the Irish Prison Service. It would bring about a big change in the level of staff and the nature of their work but how fruitful would that be at the end of the day? While we should seriously examine what is proposed, we must also be practical about it.In some ways the proposal is premature and I am surprised the Deputy has brought it before the House in view of the work being undertaken by a steering committee established by the board of the Courts Service in October 2004. That steering committee was set up to plan and provide for a system of information on sentencing. The board's initiative is designed to provide some systemic form of information as a reference point for judges. That work is under way and will soon be put into practice in the Dublin District Court for a six-week period, based on findings in New South Wales and Scotland. We have a lot to learn from other jurisdictions about the operation of justice, particularly the innovative steps that have been taken in Australia.New South Wales has a judicial commission whose major function is to assist courts in achieving consistency of approach in the sentencing of offenders. The commission's objectives in this area are to reduce unjustified disparities in sentences imposed by the courts, to improve sentencing efficiency generally and to reduce the number of appeals against sentences thereby releasing valuable resources which can be redeployed to reduce court delays. We should debate the issue of court delays on another occasion.

While I agree with the sentiments behind it, I question the practicalities of putting the structures in place in a manner which will be of benefit to the public at large. It is one thing to collect all the information in regard to sentencing to find whether Johnny got the same sentence as Mary for what seems to be the same offence. However, the reality is that without an expert analysis of each case, including an analysis of the evidence and mitigating factors taken into account by the presiding judge and without taking into account a plethora of issues, it will not be possible to make a judgment on whether there is uniformity in the sentences handed down by the various courts.The Bill proposes a new scheme of recording sentences but, even within the existing regime, many improvements could be made, for example, the idea of remission as being a standard. The present situation allows a criminal being sentenced to jail to tell his associates on the outside when he will be set free, taking into account remission. The system should not be as simple as that. Criminals are so well aware now about procedures that they can play the system, keep their noses clean and get out early to continue their life of crime.Another issue which needs to be addressed is where a criminal who may be in jail for one offence may be brought before the courts for a different offence, receive another sentence and be allowed to serve it concurrently with the sentence received for the first offence. This effectively means there is no punishment for the second offence. The logic of the matter defies explanation. How can a person serve two jail sentences at the one time? With this farcical system in place, the message to the criminals is clear. They should commit as many offences as possible as close in time to each other as possible because they will serve only one sentence.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	595	I find it ironic that we are discussing this Bill dealing with fundamental justice issues while the Government is floundering owing to the High Court's decision yesterday to release a 41 year old man serving a sentence for having sex with an under age girl. That is a disgrace. Any justice system that does not support the victim is out of touch with the people and deserves to be challenged. Therefore, I challenge all involved in this debate. I challenge the Government, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who should be sacked, the members of the legal establishment, who were paid thousands of euro of taxpayers' money, and successive Governments. They have failed this child and our citizens. The original three-year sentence was a disgrace. I wonder at times what planet our Judiciary is living on. I raise these serious matters because I feel the voiceless are not heard. I will support the rally at the gates of Leinster House on Friday.The purpose of the Bill is to create a comprehensive register of sentences so sentencing norms can be assessed, and to introduce greater transparency to the sentencing process within the criminal justice system. The Bill details the information that will be provided in the register, which will be a public document, with statutory right of access for certain categories of person and organisation. It also places a statutory duty on the Courts Service to maintain the register to a high standard. These are the main issues addressed in the Bill.We must have laws. We must have a justice system that looks after its citizens in a fair and impartial manner and, in particular, protects and defends the rights of children from sexual abuse. Above all, our justice system must have the confidence and trust of our people. At present, it does not have that trust. It is important to listen to the voice of the people. I urge all Members to support a proper and effective justice system.

Consistency is a key issue. Inconsistencies in sentences have frequently been highlighted in the media with different outcomes for cases with similar characteristics. I recall a request from Limerick County Council in a situation where two people received sentences for manslaughter for three and five years, respectively, which is an example we should examine.We see many instances where there appear to be inconsistencies in respect of the type of sentence applied by judges, whether in the District Court, Circuit Court or High Court. That aspect of the judicial system is in need of reform and the need for consistency in sentencing must be addressed, especially for minor offences at District Court level. The result of cases in the District Court often depends on the mood of the judge, with particular sentences being handed out in the morning while people are afraid to go into court in the afternoon. These cases involve the type of inconsistencies we must address.Such minor cases often merit very harsh sentences from some judges while the same offences merit relatively lenient sentences from other judges. I know of cases where a judge will destroy a person for driving at speed, another judge will jail a person for drink driving and another will jail a person for avoiding tax. There are major differences which must be addressed.The practice of imprisoning fine defaulters should be discontinued, with greater use being made of attachment of earnings or community service in response to defaulting. A judge in my constituency threatened to ask a defendant to stand in a local town with a note hanging from him stating he had committed a certain offence. The objective of that threat was that the defendant would not commit crime again. If that type of situation were considered, we would have less crime.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	597	The concept and principles behind the Bill are praiseworthy and I commend Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on the work he has put into its preparation. However, in practical terms, building and maintaining such a database would not be feasible and it would never be complete or up-to-date. Aside from the fact that the outcome of certain cases cannot be put on public record owing to the  in camera rule, it would be impossible, first, to record all the factors produced in mitigation by the defence in every court case and, second, know every detail that contributed to a judge arriving at a sentence.As others stated, a database of sex offenders is maintained in Harcourt Square, but this database is not up to date weekly and it could take anything up to a month before some court areas transmit necessary convictions to the unit responsible for maintaining the database. There is no realistic hope of the Courts Service comprehensively updating such a database weekly or even monthly.Another fear I have in regard to the existence of such a database is that it might become too easy for a judge who is having difficulty in reaching a fair sentence in a case to decide on a sentence based on another case in such a database when all the relevant factors in that case might not have been recorded in the database in the first place. A fear of not being consistent with his colleagues might overtake a fair hearing as the main deciding factor in sentencing.Judgments which make first-time offenders think twice about their actions and deter them from re-offending could be lost under such a proposed system, especially in the District Court. I accept that any measure that improves sentencing standards and consistency across the Judiciary would be welcome but a better means of achieving that would be more regular training and information seminars for judges, with judges specialising in the various aspects of law sitting at every court level, unlike the present situation where the same District Court judge often hears family law cases, civil cases, licensing applications, road traffic offences, other criminal matters and small claims court cases.I again commend Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on his preparation. I wish such innovative thinking could be found on the Government benches.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	599	It is very difficult to focus on sentencing norms when there is a such a gaping hole in the legislation protecting our children. We have been told by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste in recent days that legislation exists to prosecute people for both sexual assault and rape. The reality is that no offence now exists for statutory rape. What makes this offence different in practical terms is that the question of consent is dispensed with. We now have a situation where the onus of proof is on the child to demonstrate she did not give consent. Should the law in regard to sexual assault or rape be applied instead of statutory rape, the child will be exposed to the full rigours of the legal system, as is the case——
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The Deputy should confine her comments to the Bill.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I will move on to that. It is insulting to think people equate the two offences. There is a chasm in the laws protecting children from sexual predators.I do not have many difficulties with the principle of the existence of a database. Not only would it be in the public interest, it would be helpful for those who must impose sentences to know the norms. There is no doubt that people convicted of serious offences are held in the prison system, which serves to protect the public against them.However, only recently the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention branded the Irish prison system a failure. He stated the training and educational programmes for young offenders in St. Patrick's Institution have been closed and now there are none. I have no problem with people who commit crimes being punished but I question the value of putting young offenders in an institution where there is no possibility of rehabilitation. Not only is it bad for the offender but it offers no protection to the public in the longer term. There is clearly a need not just to register the sentences and make comparisons between them but to consider how crime and our prison population can be reduced in tandem. I presume the register will consider the impact of community service and other types of sanction. The object should be to make the country a safer place to live and there are many ways that can be achieved.

When questioned here, the Taoiseach was unable to say how many people are in prison under the law that was ruled unconstitutional. He attempted to bluff his way out of an awkward question by saying the Irish Prison Service was checking records and warrants from the courts and hoped to have a clearer picture later in the day. The Irish Prison Service should be in a position to access this information in a matter of minutes if not seconds. In a crisis such as this it is simply not acceptable for a developed nation such as ours not to have such information to hand.While the Bill is a general one it is brought into sharp focus by the events today and the events in the courts in recent days. It is simply not acceptable in the 21st century in a nation that prides itself on being an information society not to have this information to hand.While I positively welcome the development it is important that the database which will contain quite detailed information will not reveal the name or personal details of the sentenced person. This is crucial to safeguard people's privacy. This Bill would bring into being a body of information that would be an invaluable tool for members of the Judiciary, Members of the Oireachtas, researchers and others.It brings into focus also the issue of consistency in sentencing because this has received attention. While the Government has said there is a great deal of consistency in sentencing we simply do not have the facts to hand. It makes a mockery of any attempt to get consistency in sentencing if we do not have the statistical information in front of us. I can think of a number of cases where the DPP is appealing the sentence handed down by the judge on the basis of it being too lenient. Let us get the information out and proceed with the Bill.I was outraged last evening that the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, remarked it would be extremely difficult for the Courts Service to collect and maintain the information required in this Bill. This information is crucial if we are to restore confidence and legitimacy to the courts process, to sentencing and belief in the justice system. There is an obligation on the Government to provide the Courts Service with the resources that would allow the Bill to see the light of day.We need transparency and accessibility. This Bill provides one of the tools that will bring us forward in that regard. The Green Party strongly supports the Bill and hopes the Government will come to its senses and give it the support it needs.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	603	On an initial reading of the Title of the Bill, I thought it might be interesting and worthwhile but it went downhill after that. Sinn Féin is opposed to the Bill especially given the Fine Gael Party's reasoning for it when introducing it last evening. It was stated it would provide greater transparency in sentencing. Most sentences are already pronounced in public. One cannot get more transparency than that. I wish that most of what the State does was as transparent.All serious crime cases are fully reported in national and local media. If somebody wants to check whether, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said, "sentences are being imposed in a fair and rigorous manner", or if a "perceived inconsistency" is occurring, they can do so easily. Just because there is a public reaction to perceived inconsistencies does not mean those perceptions are correct. Judges should base their sentences on a hearing of the case in front of them and the law, and not on potentially inaccurate and incomplete records of previous cases.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe mentioned sentencing tariffs, in other words, minimum sentences. Where is the independence of the Judiciary when taking into account the circumstances? Let us not forget what Deputy Durkan said on this matter: "I mean no disrespect to the legal profession or to the Judiciary but the public is not interested in extenuating circumstances". Why not leave sentencing to The Star or Sunday World for that matter? Section 4(2)(d) refers to any mitigating factors relied upon by the convicted person. There is no mention of what the judge says in sentencing the person or no mention of character witnesses or much else, which informs the judge in his or her sentencing. As stated last night, under Fine Gael, there would be no concurrent sentences. In terms of remission for prisoners, it proposes that the carrot and big stick approach be used. Going by the previous record of its Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that would be a very big stick.What is to happen when a person has paid his or her debt to society? Is that person entitled to try to rebuild his or her life? This register would allow them to be victimised, discriminated against and targeted because access to Fine Gael's proposed register would be near universal according to the list produced. Even if numbers were allocated to give some semblance of anonymity, a basic cross-referencing of newspaper reportage could identify the individual.In Britain, last month, it emerged that more than 1,500 were listed as criminals despite their innocence and the effect that such a mistake had on their lives. They were blacklisted from jobs, harassed and barred from some premises. The proposed register is impractical and replicates much of what the Garda Síochána should already have on its PULSE system. If it does not record the results of cases it is prosecuting or bringing to court it is incompetent and needs to be dealt with. Obviously the existing material on the PULSE system should and could be checked in the case of claims being sought for child workers to ensure abusers do not end up working with children.The proposed register is contrary to existing laws, for example, the in camera rule in cases of domestic violence and cases of juveniles. The Fine Gael Party’s time would be much better spent producing better Bills which would go some way to addressing the flaws in the judicial system rather than this type of carry on.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I wish to share time with Deputy Enright. I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, on bringing this Bill to the House. That it comes before the House this week is unique.This is a relatively small but important Bill. It is a useful step towards making sentencing transparent and understood by the public. Many members of the public cannot understand why one person convicted of a crime gets a certain sentence while in another part of the country a similar offence attracts either a higher or lower sentence. Many who do not have a legal training cannot understand that aspect.The Bill could not be more straightforward or more easily understood and could be easily implemented. One could argue that if one were to ask the Government to do anything on a database, from the electronic voting machines to PPARS and so on, it could not do it. It has a very bad record so I hope that if it gets down to business on this, it will not make a hames of it like it did out of everything else. We have the technology to do it. Let nobody tell me that in a court in Cahirciveen or in Belmullet or Clifden, what happens there on a daily basis could not be inputted to a central computer through the Courts Service where all the information which we in Fine Gael believe should be on the register could be stored. I cannot understand why that would not be possible, given the technology available to us.It is vitally important that not only the public, but the Judiciary, senior counsel, people in the Courts Service and policy makers sing from the same hymn sheet. It has been mentioned in this House several times last night and tonight that the ultimate happened this week, and the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General did not know how many sex offenders were jailed for statutory rape in Irish prisons. They did not know that in this House yesterday morning.It is against that background that the register of which I speak would be immensely useful. What we want is a record, easily obtainable and accessed by all the people I have mentioned, particularly the injured parties. For instance, how many drug pushers have been convicted who have got more or less than the minimum sentence? If the record of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the past two days is anything to go by, he would not be able to say, nor would anybody from the Minister down be able to supply that figure. Furthermore, with regard to drunken drivers who kill innocent people going about their normal duties, why does one judge seem to take one line and for some strange reason — we must all accept the judge is in possession of all the facts — a much more lenient sentence is handed down to another drunken driver in another part of the country? The public cannot understand that. This is what we are talking about.Some of my colleagues seem to want to throw cold water on the Bill. They include some Independent Members and some Fianna Fáil Members. I carried out an in-depth survey in east Galway recently on matters relating to crime and people's opinions on what the courts were doing. A total of 1,450 respondents answered 38 questions and went to the trouble of posting their replies, which were professionally evaluated. I have not got the time to read out all the questions, but one was whether respondents had confidence in the ability of the courts to combat crime. A total of 26% said "Yes" and 74% said "No". Another question was whether our courts system is tackling repeat offenders — a big question. A total of 19% said "Yes" and 81% said "No", an overwhelming majority. The survey also asked whether repeat offenders should serve their full sentences without remission, and 95% said "Yes" while 5% said "No". Those answers came from ordinary people with ordinary lifestyles, and we should take notice of such information.As Members of this House, we understand fully the separation of Executive powers from the judicial system. As an elected Member of this House, the last thing I want is interference in the judicial system. Everyone in this House shares that view. At the end of the day, however, the laws made in this Chamber must be interpreted by the judges. That is what they are there for. I have no crow to pick with judges, good, bad or indifferent. As a body they are very professional and do the best they can. However, there is a large, growing body of opinion that suggests judges are sometimes too lenient. On a few occasions, the DPP has asked that another look be taken at a particular court decision.Fine Gael policy, as enunciated by our spokesman on justice, equality and law reform, and by our leader, is that in so far as discretion is concerned — I am speaking of minimum sentences — the exact limits for judges involved with particular offences should be clearly outlined. However, if for possibly good reason a judge decides he or she will go above or below those limits, which were decided by this House, the judge should publicly state in open court why such a decision was taken. That is a reasonable suggestion, which many people would be happy to see implemented, and it is not interfering with the discretion of judges as such.I want to talk of remission of sentences. As we know, someone sentenced to four years in jail and who keeps his or her nose clean, or not clean, is automatically released after three years. That is what remission means. Remission should be earned. I am among those people who have always believed that the rehabilitation aspect for prisoners should be taken seriously. We all know that if people are put into an environment where all are as bad as each other, so to speak, some emerge worse than when they entered. They learn all the tricks inside.I know that many people in the Irish Prison Service genuinely believe that people should be given every opportunity to go straight. One can imagine what that could mean for the prisoner, his or her family and society, if through this system they are given the opportunity not to reoffend or at least in so far as is possible — I am not silly enough to believe it will happen every time. That matter should be taken more seriously by the Government. If someone takes a conscious decision when in custody not to become involved in the programme, I would leave that person in jail for the full term.

The Bill published by Fine Gael and my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, is timely and necessary. What we are doing in Fine Gael is addressing the need to create a comprehensive system whereby a register of all sentences handed down will be created. This will allow much greater ease of comparison by all involved in our criminal justice system and will be the definitive database.This Bill will also allow people to assess the trends in sentencing policy and will help ensure greater consistency in sentencing by relying on real and factual information. No individual will be singled out under Fine Gael's proposal, which addresses a legitimate query raised by Deputy Cuffe. Rather, cases will be recorded by a case number. The information is already there but we are attempting to collate it in a single resource. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has already dealt with the key provisions of the Bill and I do not propose to repeat what he said. I am not surprised at the comments of Deputy Ó Snodaigh. He appears to want the criminal justice system to rely only on media records of sentencing, saying they cover all cases. The media does not cover all cases.I do not know what amount of time Deputy Ó Snodaigh and his colleagues have spent in the criminal justice system. In my previous career as a solicitor, I did a certain amount of court work. In many of those courts, the media was not present. Regardless of this, the media tends to choose the juicier story and whatever will sell a newspaper. Very often these can be the cases that have no bearing on the consistency of sentencing. Justice must be seen to be done. We, as legislators, have a duty to ensure that happens. No names would be used in the register. It is clear the Deputy does not understand the Bill.The events of the past week show the need for the Fine Gael Party's proposal. However, this measure is not reactive legislation but was discussed and debated at our Ard-Fheis earlier this month. Last week the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, asked the Taoiseach how many people were in prison under the law that the Supreme Court had declared unconstitutional. The Taoiseach could not answer the question. Instead he told the House the Prison Service was checking records and warrants and he hoped to have a clearer picture by lunchtime that day. The picture is still fuzzy. All I could imagine was prison service staff going through court ledgers, checking handwritten entries. I am sure, or at least I hope, that the system is not as archaic, although it does not appear to be far off that. There was no fast and easily accessible way of checking the records to answer a reasonable and straightforward question.The purpose of the Bill is to establish a register of sentences that would allow information of this type to be readily available. Today the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children was unable to answer a question from Deputy Kenny about convictions under section 1(2) of the Act in question. Under our proposals, it would be possible for a Government to know how many people have been convicted of any given offence without delay at the touch of a button.Such a register would also ensure that, as legislators, we know the precise number of people convicted of any given crime. It is especially important that, in tracking the incidence of sexual assaults against adults or children, as much information as possible is at our disposal. This will allow us to deal with these serious crimes adequately and put in place the best possible protection for children and young people.The Taoiseach told the Dáil yesterday, in response to questions on the issue of the release of the man known as Mr. A and the possible release of several other men:All of this is to protect our children . . . It is all about protecting our young people so that they can move around freely and their parents can understand they are safe.He then went on to say:The Government and, I am sure, everybody else, want to protect our children and be seen to do so. We are satisfied that we have a strong body of law.We do not have a strong body of law to protect children. Are we yet again reacting to a crisis, as we always seem to do on issues of child safety? Ireland does not offer the best possible protection. Child safety is not a priority until something happens. We have failed to learn the lesson from the past. Ireland's child protection and vetting procedures seriously lag behind other jurisdictions, especially Northern Ireland.There has been a protracted delay in extending vetting procedures to the education sector. While vetting is beginning for new teachers I have not seen any proposals to extend this vetting to those already in the teaching service or in any other capacity in our schools. The Fine Gael Party believes that staff or volunteers, either full or part-time, should be vetted before taking up positions where they would have substantial unsupervised access to children.To make this happen, the central vetting unit should be expanded and extended, resourced properly and its services made available to charities and voluntary sporting and youth organisations. Under the Fine Gael proposals, staff in the Health Service Executive and organisations funded by it, teachers and other staff at schools, staff or volunteers at charities and voluntary sporting and youth organisations would be vetted if they have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults.In addition, the legislative framework in place to ensure the protection of children and young people has not been completed. There are serious gaps in place which the Government has failed to address. It has repeatedly promised to bring forward legislation to establish a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children. It is long overdue. Hand in hand with enhanced vetting, a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children must be a key aspect to our approach to child safety, yet there is still no sign of the legislation needed to establish such a register. It has been promised repeatedly and has appeared on the Government legislative programme time and again, yet no further details regarding this legislation or the register have been published.Other legislative recommendations, such as the amendment of both the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998 and the Sex Offenders Act 2001, respectively to include the reporting of abuse of vulnerable adults and offer a greater degree of protection to those with physical disabilities, have also failed to attract any priority from the Government. The extreme delays in bringing forward the necessary new and amending legislation are not acceptable. As the events of this week have shown, there can be no room for error or complacency in the matter of child protection. The abuse of children detailed in the Ferns Report and highlighted by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is horrifying. The need for thorough vetting and for a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children is highlighted by one finding of the Ferns Report, which stated:The Inquiry believes that the appointment as Chairman of the Board of Management of national schools . . . should be made with the utmost care and diligence. As will be obvious from the allegations set out in this Report, some priests appear to have abused their position as Managers of national schools in order to access children.Candidates for school boards of management must also be subject to vetting.Last year it was revealed that a convicted sex offender was employed as a bus driver for special needs children in the Laoighis-Offaly constituency. Clear gaps in our child safety procedures must be addressed. We urgently need legislation to establish a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children. The Government must prioritise this matter for the coming Dáil session.It is important the Fine Gael Party's proposals be adopted and that a register of sentences be put in place. At the same time, a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children must be established.What is the status of Mr. A's conviction? Will he remain on the register of sex offenders? What happens if he decides to try to have his conviction quashed? If Mr. A wants to get a job in a school tomorrow or work with children in any other paid or voluntary capacity, be it in a sports club or elsewhere, no one will be any the wiser about his previous behaviour. His sentence no longer stands. A High Court judge declared that he was unlawfully detained and he walked free.There are people who do not have convictions but who are still a danger to children. When the Fine Gael Party published its proposals for vetting, both conviction and non-conviction, commonly called soft information, were included. After a debate in the Dáil in December 2003 on it and the lack of real action on this issue since then, I believe the Government is avoiding making a decision issue in case it upsets someone. Mr. A was convicted on a charge that did not exist in law and so he is free. He was originally convicted. Will he be included on a sex offenders register? Either way the use of soft information would allow an employer to know about his history if he looks for employment. It would also allow a youth or sporting organisation the knowledge it needs not to employ him. I remind the House that Ian Huntley had no criminal convictions.When speaking on the Fine Gael Private Members' motion on vetting and child safety three years ago, the then Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, told the House the best course of action was to wait for the outcome of the deliberations of a working group. It has long since reported but we are still waiting. He was speaking on the advice of the Attorney General that hard facts are disclosable but soft facts are not. That is why this register is needed and why the Government must take the issue of child safety seriously. It must face up to the issue of soft information with all of the safeguards the Fine Gael Party has suggested.I ask the Government to accept Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's Bill. It is always reluctant to accept any idea that is not its own but I hope it will learn from its mistakes. The Fine Gael Party's proposals are sound and sensible. Their enactment will assist the criminal justice system and ensure greater consistency in sentencing.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	606	I thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for raising an interesting debate. The aim of the Bill is to shed more light on the issue of sentencing and provide a database which would be useful to the Judiciary and policy makers in the criminal justice area. We on this side of the House generally share this aim. The problem we see with the proposed Bill is that, first, it is anticipating an area of work on which an expert committee of the Courts Service is sitting and, second, many of its detailed proposals would be administratively difficult to implement or are impractical.It is simply not enough to record new data about sentencing. If such data is to be useful, collection must be carefully planned. It must be decided what are the most salient issues on which information needs to be collected and how such information should be processed to produce useful data. I expect that the Courts Service committee examining this issue will address these matters and come forward with workable proposals.Matters are not as simple as the Deputies on the other side of the House might suggest. Tens of thousands of cases pass through our courts every year. Many cases are appealed to higher courts resulting in sentences given in the original court being changed. All these issues must be addressed in compiling sentencing data. As pointed out by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the information required under this Bill would be very difficult for the Courts Service to collect and maintain. Even though the Courts Service has invested heavily in modern information technology systems, its nationwide computer system, the criminal case tracking system, does not contain anything like the level of detail required in the Bill.There is no doubt that sentencing is a complex matter and that many variable factors are taken into account in each case. To attempt to address this issue, the board of the Courts Service has established a steering committee to plan for and provide a system of information on sentencing. The high level membership of the committee, which is chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, shows the seriousness with which the Courts Service takes this issue.The committee will establish a pilot project in the Circuit Court in Dublin which will collect and collate information on sentencing outcomes in cases on indictment in designated courts in accordance with criteria specified by the committee. It will be interesting to see if the committee recommends some type of sentencing information system for our courts in due course.The Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 enables the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and, in this regard, funds are made available to the Judicial Studies Institute which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. A sum of €483,000 was made available for 2006 and I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.Section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 provides for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, inter alia, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar statutory provision in the case of other courts, I understand they hold similar meetings.As regards seeking consistency in sentencing generally, this is, I understand, a matter to which courts at all levels have given considerable attention over recent years. There is, in fact, a great deal of consistency in sentencing and discussions which arise concerning inconsistency relate to a relatively small proportion of cases, often inaccurately. Nonetheless, inconsistency arises from time to time and it is a problem which faces every legal system.It is worth mentioning again that the complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission. The commission specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines in a report published in 1996. On the commission's recommendation against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines, it is fair to say that statutory guidelines would involve an undue interference in the independence of the Judiciary.The decision on what kind of sentence to impose is a judicial determination and, save only in exceptional circumstances, it is the Minister's view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences. After all, the point was made in the commission's report that the more detailed the requirements of any statutory sentencing procedure, the more likely it was that mistakes would arise leaving sentences open to challenge on technical grounds only.While the working group on the jurisdiction of the courts only touched on the issue of sentencing, it found that there was a need for some system of objective guidance for sentencing at all levels. One option proposed by the working group could be accommodated within the present system, namely, the more effective dissemination of decisions which are regarded as being authoritative in nature, especially decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. These benchmark cases would at the same time assist trial judges and enable the public to understand more clearly the principles behind sentencing decisions.There have been attempts by Fine Gael to link the Private Members' Bill to the issues arising from the recent decision of the Supreme Court on the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935. This, I suggest, is merely political opportunism. These two issues have nothing to do with each other. It is disingenuous to link them. I have heard no arguments from the Opposition which would convince me that this Bill should not be opposed at this time.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I wish to share time with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. I thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for bringing this Bill before the House. It is 12 months or more since I put a great deal of work into preparing for a television programme on the issue of sentencing in my constituency. Unfortunately, the individual responsible for the programme decided to opt out and took retirement, and it never was made. In that context, I am very aware that, in parts of Cavan and Monaghan, the sentencing for a long period was unbelievable.The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, stated that he cannot find anything in this Bill to justify it being brought in and he wants to oppose it. I listened to his argument and it is incredible that the information on this matter could not be put on a database. It is only within this Government that matters to do with computers seem to be impossible.I am not a computer whizz kid but I deal with companies and organisations which use computers. If one wants to find out the position of a herd register of a farm, for example, all one need do is press a few buttons and one gets the results. One then knows whether an animal has been transferred legally through the system and if it has not, one will soon be rightly told. That means the national herd may be traced daily.When we changed over from the punt to the euro, the banks were able to make the transition the following morning and to bring up all our accounts on computer in a different currency. It did not matter whether we were in the USA, Germany or elsewhere, if we had money in our account all we had to do was put in a card, press the buttons and we got our money. I find it difficult to believe that this issue is too complicated to put on a database.I remember speaking on another Bill about which I was extremely passionate, the Fines Bill, which promoted the attachment of fines to income and social welfare payments. We were assured in this House that the Bill was premature and that the matter would be dealt with shortly. Some years later members of the Garda Síochána are driving around collecting fines at a time when they are badly needed in the area of traffic control, to prevent robberies and so on. The collection of fines could easily be done either through the social welfare office or by deducting money from a person's income. Such a system would save Garda time and guarantee that all fines are collected.The purpose of this Bill is to try to bring about sentencing norms and establish trends in sentencing. There is a need for transparency in the system and for it to be seen to be just. I recall a time when those who were in court knew they would avoid a harsher sentence by paying a fine to a charity. It got to the stage where some of these ruffians asked gardaí for a loan to pay to the charity. That is not a joke, it is a fact. It was not until there was a change of judge that some of these people began to learn manners. There is an absolute need for transparency and assurance that justice will prevail.As verdicts are not kept on file in a transparent manner, if a person reoffends, he or she can come before another court, as has been the case many times in my area and the Garda does not have any means of ensuring the judge is aware that certain individuals are hardened criminals. That is not the way we should run our justice system. I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the unbelievable comments he made to the effect that what we seek to do is not possible and allow the Bill to go through this House as some small means of trying to improve the justice system.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	608	I thank all Members who contributed to this debate, even those who opposed my Bill. I find it incredible that anyone could oppose what appears to me, as somebody who has practised law for many years and who has been in this House for many years, the most sensible approach one could adopt to obtain consistency in sentencing. I have looked at the situation in other countries and, whether one talks about sentencing information systems or registers of sentences, information is available to judges. Before they apply sentences they can find out what kind of sentence was applied in similar types of cases. Surely that makes the most basic sense.My colleague, Deputy Crawford, stated that if he wants information about his cows he can press buttons and find out the information. Surely if a judge is carrying out his or her constitutional duty and may be imposing a heavy sentence of imprisonment, the least we can do is provide him or her with a database whereby he or she can check the kinds of sentences applied to similar types of offences in recent years. It is as simple as that.I was struck by the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who in last night's debate appeared to accept the Bill. He could not say with a straight face that the Bill did not make sense but he said it is premature. I do not know on what basis he considers it premature because recent events confirm it is utterly timely.The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, stated there is no linkage with current events. The link simply is that the Taoiseach, on being asked in the House by the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, how many cases were affected by the Supreme Court decision, could not say. Even as late as this morning, Deputy Kenny asked the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, for similar information in regard to how many prisoners were sentenced under sections 111 and 112 of the 1935 Act and she could not say.It sounds incredible in this day and age, in this allegedly technologically advanced country, that this kind of information would not be available to the senior Ministers in the Government. The information is not available to judges or to the members of the Cabinet who make weighty decisions as to the legislation they should bring forward — perhaps they could give us a consultation agenda instead of specific proposals, but that is another issue. Neither is the information available to the Members of this House, to those of us who genuinely want to see an improvement in our laws and criminal justice system. On that basis it is incredible that this Bill is not welcomed with open arms by the Government.The purpose of the Bill is fairly clear. It is non-contentious and non-controversial. Its purpose is to create a comprehensive register of sentences so that sentencing norms can be assessed. Who could oppose that? A secondary purpose is to introduce greater transparency to the sentencing process within the criminal justice system. Who could oppose that? The Constitution rightly provides that justice shall be administered in public, except in a limited number of specially defined cases. We should have greater transparency.The purpose of the Bill is not opposed. The Government approach is to agree "that there is a need for more data on sentencing, both for use by the Judiciary themselves ... and for the purposes of public oversight". That was stated by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in the House last night. In that case, how can the Government justify opposing the Bill?I accept that issues arise in terms of the amount of detail outlined at this initial stage but I am open to amending the Bill on Committee Stage so that the extensive detail I have outlined can be modified. I put in the kettle, the pot and the lot in terms of the data that should be included, but I accept that one would not, perhaps, begin on that basis. I wish to have the essential principle established, that we should have a register and that we should commence work on it. The detail can be worked out on Committee Stage if one accepts the basic need for a register and that the Bill would provide the legislative framework for such a register.The Government's approach is that the implementation of this measure "would present significant logistical and resource problems". I accept that. There are no free lunches in this world. If one wants something, one must pay for it. I want a good system that will enable judges to do their job better. It is not fair that judges are criticised. Some judges who work hard and try to do the best they can are then excoriated in the press because they have strayed from what is perceived to be the norm in terms of a sentence they have passed.They do not have access to the information so they must rely on their memory, judgment and knowledge. It has been alleged that we are denying them this knowledge. My party and our Opposition colleagues want judges to have access to this information but this Government apparently does not. This remark may be slightly unfair. The Government is acting like St. Augustine in that it wants to make this information available but not just yet. It wants to be pure in respect of this issue but not just yet. When will we take the necessary steps? It is all very well for the Minister to tell me about committees, reports and other matters but this Government is nearing the end of its tenure. Does the Government favour putting in place a basic tool or instrument which would be of assistance in and improve the administration of justice and allow the public to see, with full transparency, the kind of sentences which are passed.This information should also be available to the media. The media sometimes makes legitimate and justified criticisms because judges do not possess this information but it sometimes makes half-cocked criticisms about sentences. We would introduce a totally open system which would not involve publishing the names of offenders. The register would simply contain case numbers which would enable offenders' identities to be protected after they had served their sentences. I am amazed that judges, the courts, the public, the media, this House and the Government are not allowed the benefit of such a register. I appeal to the Government for the last time to accept the Bill. I am prepared to deal with legitimate practical aspects of it on Committee Stage but the way to deal with them is to accept Second Stage.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak on this matter and the Minister of State for attending to reply.The meals on wheels service, which is provided by SUPPORT in the Finglas area, has played a pivotal role in community care throughout the country. In this context, it is vital to maintain and expand services to ensure that every older person can benefit. The Government is committed to extending the service and there was a significant increase provided in the last budget to allow for €12.5 million to be spent nationally in 2006 and an additional €2.5 million next year.In this context, it is not acceptable that the SUPPORT meals on wheels service, which operates in four sheltered housing complexes in Finglas — Mellowes Court, St. Helena's Court, Glasanon Court and Clareville Court — must cease operation in June due to lack of funding. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister of State to do everything in his power to ensure it does not happen.SUPPORT is a voluntary organisation that has operated in Finglas since 1994 and is currently providing 70 meals per day to the aforementioned sheltered housing schemes. On average, this equates to 2,000 meals provided for more than 100 people per month. From a cost viewpoint, this service is excellent value for money. SUPPORT sponsors a community employment scheme for 27 participants, all of whom are engaged in the preparation, cooking and serving of meals. For this it receives annual funding of around €350,000 from FÁS and has been provided with accommodation and use of kitchen equipment free of charge from Dublin City Council since 1999. From the former Northern Area Health Board it receives a subvention of €1.40 per meal, equating to annual funding of €17,000.Since 2004, SUPPORT has been using this money to fund wages for two drivers who deliver meals and collect food supplies. They work ten hours a week and are a vital element of this service. It will probably be asked why there are no volunteer drivers. Unfortunately, the cost of petrol has risen and it is not easy to get volunteers for this type of work anymore.Since the beginning of this year, it has become apparent that SUPPORT can no longer use the subvention money to pay drivers — it just will not stretch to meet these costs. The staff raised this issue with the relevant authorities and have highlighted the urgency of the matter. They have been doing all they can to bring in extra funding. They applied for a lottery grant, which was refused, and they are awaiting a decision on dormant account funding. They raised the issue with the HSE in March and have received no further communication on the matter.In these circumstances, a decision has been made to cease the meals on wheels service on 30 June. The Minister of State does not need me to outline the benefits of the scheme but it is important that they are listed in order to highlight the impact of this closure.The provision of a daily meal is considered a vital part of an elderly patient's discharge plan from hospital. Referrals come from public health nurses, local GPs and social workers. This service is, therefore, vital to the discharge of all elderly patients in Finglas. It allows for older people to be cared for at home and in their own community, ensuring they maintain home comforts and independence, as well as reducing costs for health boards. Apart from the provision of a meal, the social contact involved is important. The service is a means of keeping in contact with older people, many of whom live alone and suffer from loneliness. Of the 70 meals that SUPPORT provides, 90% of them are to people on their own.For SUPPORT to continue to provide these meals to help these older people who are on their own and dependent on the service, we must immediately clarify where the funding will come from to pay these drivers. I raised this issue with Dublin City Council and the HSE last year but to no avail.It will cost approximately €10,000 to pay for drivers from now until December. From these projected costs, we can expect it will cost only €20,000 per annum for this vital delivery and collection service within the context of increasing funding for this service nationally by a total of €5 million, a 50% increase since 2004. I appeal to the Minister to find these funds and to ensure they remain in place for SUPPORT. This guarantee will allow the service to continue and will enable many older people to remain living at home and receiving care in their community amongst their friends and family. We should do everything possible to enable them to do this.All the funds received from FÁS are solely used for participant wages, protective clothing, kitchen staff and training. Half of the participants' training must be spent on training required by the HSE in food handling.SUPPORT recently had to stop taking referrals from hospital social workers and public health nurses. It has expressed serious concern about the future of its patients and their continuing residence at home without a daily meal. Some households receive more than one meal. In one household, SUPPORT provides meals to a 90 year old woman who has two mentally disabled sons in their late 50s who are totally dependent on the service. Another lady must give the driver a key so she can let herself in to bring the meal to her in bed because she is too weak to leave it because of breathing difficulties. A number of clients are elderly diabetic patients who have amputated limbs. Patients in the early stages of senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease, who often cannot remember what day it is, are also clients. Another elderly man living alone is terminally ill from cancer.The delivery person is an important contact for these people. Many times they have alerted the emergency services, having found the patient unconscious on the floor following a fall the previous night. Often patients cannot afford to pay for their meals on time as they have no access to their pensions. This puts a further strain on finances because SUPPORT will not see an older person go without a meal. These people do not regard the service as a luxury but as a necessity. This is especially the case in winter when they are most vulnerable.I ask the Minister of State, therefore, to intervene on behalf of this service to ensure the necessary funding is provided before the unnecessary closure of the service on 30 June.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I thank the Deputy for raising the question as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the current situation in the meals on wheels service nationally and to indicate the priority we give it. It plays a vital role in the provision of community care and I express our appreciation to all involved in the service, particularly those working on a voluntary basis.This Government has made services for older people a priority, supporting older people in dignity to live in their own communities for as long as possible. The meals on wheels service plays an important role by providing regular, nutritious meals and essential social contact for older people. These play an important role in facilitating older people to remain at home and in good health.I recently attended an awards ceremony where a volunteer was given an award for the efforts he had made on the part of numerous voluntary organisations, one of which was meals on wheels. He referred to one person he calls on whose nearest neighbour lives half a mile away. He often asked himself as he was closing the gate which was more important, the meal he brought or the visit he had paid.Additional funding for services for older people of €150 million was allocated in the 2006 budget. This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people, reflecting the new emphasis on home and day care. Almost three quarters, €109 million of the full year costs, are committed to community care supports. Within this allocation, the meals on wheels service received additional funding of €2.5 million for 2006 and a further €2.5 million for 2007.The HSE has advised that St. Canice's day care centre, which provides meals on wheels in the Finglas area, receives funding by agreement from the executive. The HSE has also advised that the manager for services for older people in the local health office, north-west Dublin, will make arrangements to meet St. Canice's day centre to discuss any financial difficulties it may be experiencing at this time in the provision of meals on wheels with a view to sustaining this valuable service.I thank Deputy Carey for outlining the difficulties that have arisen. We are aware of the importance of the service in the area and the prospect of closure is not one we would entertain. We will make every effort to ensure the service continues and the financial difficulties are addressed and will keep Deputy Carey up to date on the situation.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	611	At the outset, I commend the initial introduction of the 45 day retention period during a dangerous time in our economic history, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. It was a commendable measure and I fully support its continuation in most instances.That said, there are a number of problems emerging, particularly for small farmers or dealers, known as feeders, who buy cattle for a period, finish them and take them to be slaughtered for consumption. From a small farmer's perspective, people who have cattle and are dependent on these feeders buying and finishing cattle for them over a period of eight, ten or 12 weeks have found that because of the shortage of foodstuff and the enormous amount of rain that has fallen, whatever surplus foodstuff they had was used and they had to sell at a reduced price. They were vulnerable and prey for people who were prepared to take advantage of that situation.The small type feeder, people who buy in lots in cattle marts or buy from other farmers, might buy in ten or 12 cattle and, of those, two would probably be finished in three to four weeks, certainly much less than the 45 days. The retention period for which they are compelled to hold them is in excess of 45 days unless they have a dealer's licence or the facilities whereby they can separate their cattle in their respective holdings. The knock-on effect is that they must feed them and, by the time they are slaughtered in the factory, the grade of that cattle has declined because they have gone beyond being finished, as we would call it. That is one aspect.Another aspect is that most finishers or feeders, as we call them, are very susceptible to the meat industry in general. In the space of two or three weeks the price of finished cattle can drop in the factories and they are compelled to hold them if they have bought them within the 45-day retention period. Taking all that into consideration, perhaps there is an argument, especially in regard to finishing off cattle — I am not talking about dealers because they are covered by licence and so forth — for beginning to address in a proactive way the problems of small farmers in the industry who work to maintain their holdings in what is a rapidly declining rural population, and especially a small farming population.All Members of this House, especially rural Deputies, are aware of the situation in rural Ireland, particularly in regard to the viability of trying to maintain a holding, make a living and put one's family through the education process and so forth. Perhaps an argument could be made in that regard as well. I ask the Minister of State to consider examining that in a positive way.I have no problem with the retention period in most instances but where we are talking about finishing cattle, and cattle are tested after finishing — the meat is tested and so forth when they are killed — all that is taken care of in that regard. I ask the Minister of State to look favourably on this issue and perhaps over the next weeks and months she may come to a decision to address the points I make.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. The Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for implementing arrangements for the approval and registration of persons engaged in dealing in cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry under the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act 2001. As the Deputy said, that Act was introduced in the context of concerns that arose during the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001 and included, inter alia, a provision requiring dealers to be approved and registered to provide further assurances on the health status and traceability of our national herd.The purpose of this legislation and the regulations adopted under it was to minimise the risks of disease outbreaks, reduce the spread of disease and ensure traceability of all movements to secure and preserve markets at home and abroad. It also implements aspects of EU legislation on dealers.Under the legislation, a dealer is classified as a person who purchases cattle, sheep, pigs or poultry and supplies them to another person within a period of 45 days. The 45-day rule was introduced to facilitate farmer trade and reduce exposure of cattle to disease risks associated with frequent trading patterns. We have no evidence that this rule is acting as a significant barrier to trading in animals through the marts or otherwise.The Deputy alluded to the definition of "dealer" in his remarks. The definition of "dealer" in the Act, and carried through to the regulations, extends to all individuals who sell or supply animals on a regular basis within 45 days of purchase. In principle, therefore, all those trading animals, including those supplying for slaughter within a 45 day period, must be registered as dealers. However, the Department does not require those who engage in occasional trade on their own behalf or on behalf of others to apply for approval and registration.The regulations introduced a number of obligations and responsibilities for dealers. In particular, if dealers are assembling or holding animals other than at an approved assembly point, they must have their premises approved for this purpose and the premises must meet certain minimum standards. Dealers must also comply with regulatory requirements regarding bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis and animal identification and registration rules. However, dealers are not obliged to have a premises. Those who buy or procure animals for other parties and supply the animals directly to those parties without assembling them or bringing them to an intermediate point do not need to have premises. Nevertheless, they must be registered and approved by the Department and are obliged to maintain records and comply with movement, disease testing rules etc.All applicants for registration as dealers must undertake to comply with the regulations regarding the notification of animal movements, standard of facilities, disease control, record keeping etc. Each dealer is provided with an official identity card, with photograph, which should be presented in respect of animal and poultry transactions. Approved dealers and premises are subject to ongoing monitoring and inspection by officers of the Department.The Department is reviewing the dealer legislation. The review will be comprehensive and will include an examination of the definition of a dealer. It will be completed soon.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this issue concerning the construction of a new school at Croom. Coláiste Chiarán is a second level school in Croom under the auspices of the County Limerick Vocational Education Committee. There are 580 students attending the college. In the 2006-07 school year, it is predicted that number will increase to 700.I wish to raise with the Minister of State the fact that up to two thirds of the college's accommodation is now in prefabricated classrooms. The conditions for teaching and learning are unsuitable for both students and teachers. It is an unacceptable educational environment and I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment to the early commencement of the construction of acceptable accommodation and a new school at Croom. At a time of Exchequer multiple surpluses, the construction of the new school must not be restricted by the usual Department of Finance limitations. I ask the Minister of State to fast forward the construction of the school and stop the discrimination against students and teachers because of the unacceptable conditions.The school has grown and developed significantly over the past six to seven years and has a reputation for excellent educational standards. It has done so on a temporary accommodation basis. Classroom conditions are overheated in summer and cold in winter. The Minister of State will accept that such conditions are intolerable in 2006.Coláiste Chiarán is a progressive and dynamic college community with great emphasis put on information and communications technology and innovative teaching methodology. The overall aim is to equip its students with the academic, practical and social skills necessary for success in further education and the workplace. The original vocational school was established in 1938 and the current structure constructed as a first phase of school development in 1986.Croom village and the catchment area of the college is a vastly expanding community. It is situated approximately ten miles from Limerick city. The advent of the new national primary road from Limerick city and the bypass of Croom has created a very attractive residential area with easy access to the city. The population is growing and with the updating of services to the village, it will mushroom.While the construction of a new school within the earmarked 18-acre site is urgently required for current student accommodation, it is vital to plan second level educational facilities for the future, taking into consideration population expansion. I understand the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, promised to raise the issue with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, yesterday. Will the Minister brief the House on the outcome and details of that discussion?A majority percentage of pupils from outside the catchment area were refused their first choice of college within their catchment area. The parents chose Coláiste Chiarán as the best opportunity to maximise the educational opportunity for their children. It is the parents' right to do this.The urgent case for a new school in Croom is merited. I urge the Minister to expedite the construction of such a school. It has the full support of the County Limerick Vocational Education Committee and all who see the school as a vastly expanding educational centre in urgent need of acceptable and modern conditions. This will facilitate the present population of the school, as well as the predicted population over the years. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	614	At the outset, I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the proposed developments at post-primary level in Croom, County Limerick.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of underinvestment in this area, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and ensure that appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.As evidence of this commitment, there will be in the region of 1,300 building and modernisation projects active in our primary and post-primary schools during 2006. Over €500 million is being spent on the primary and post-primary projects throughout the country. This unprecedented level of capital investment is testament to the importance the Government places on improving the quality of accommodation in our schools.Coláiste Chiarán is the only post-primary school in Croom and is a co-educational provider with a current enrolment of 435 mainstream pupils and 146 students attending post-leaving certificate courses. The school's accommodation comprises some permanent accommodation and an extensive number of prefabricated buildings provided for the school over the years to address its growing enrolment.County Limerick VEC has applied to the Department of Education and Science for funding towards the provision of a new school building for Coláiste Chiarán. Given the restricted nature of the existing site, the Department has given approval to County Limerick VEC to purchase a site to facilitate the development of a new replacement school. The next step in the process is the determination of the long-term projected enrolment on which the school's future accommodation needs will be based. Officials in my Department are currently engaged with the VEC on this issue and factors being examined include the population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments and the likely impact of recent and planned housing developments in the area.When the long-term projected enrolment has been finalised, schedules of accommodation will be drawn up. The project will then be ready to enter the architectural planning process. The building project will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme for 2006-10.I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which allows me to outline the progress being made under the school building and modernisation programme and in particular the position of Coláiste Chiarán in Croom.

There is an obesity epidemic sweeping the country at the moment. According to the national obesity task force report, 300,000 children are overweight or obese and this is growing by 10,000 annually.In a survey which I carried out in 2005 in 1,400 primary schools, I discovered that only 23% of the schools had a sports hall and their physical education programmes were severely curtailed because of the lack of indoor facilities. Many schools were unable to do the minimum amount of physical activity because of the lack of an indoor facility or even an outdoor facility. There are genuine concerns about young children being injured in school yards, which raises the question of liability.Apart from our schools, there is a cohort of children of pre-school age who need play, which can clearly also be relevant to children of school age. The provision of playgrounds in communities across the country is essential. There is no national scheme on this issue.I will refer in particular to Kerry County Council, which has been proactive in addressing the issue of public play provision for children. In February 2003, Kerry was one of the first local authorities to launch a countywide policy on the development and management of public playgrounds. I was on the relevant committee at that time.Since the policy, Developing Play in Kerry, was launched, an internal play appraisal team has been established to ensure that all decisions about play are compliant with the policy. This has provided a more centralised and co-ordinated approach to the development and management of outdoor playground areas. A guideline booklet entitled An Spraoi has been produced by Kerry County Council to assist community groups interested in developing outdoor public playground areas. It outlines eight basic steps, and once communities follow these steps, they can apply to Kerry County Council for insurance cover.All applications are assessed by the play appraisal team. To date, the play appraisal team has approved nine projects for insurance cover. These are located in Ballybunion, Cahirciveen, Waterville, Killorglin, Sneem, Clohane, Ballyheigue, Fenit and Rossbeigh. Four of these projects are completed and two are at an early stage of construction. The remaining three have not started construction due to lack of funding. These projects are proposed for Fenit, Sneem and Rossbeigh, all of which have or intend to raise 20% of the projected costs locally.Considering the high capital costs associated with developing a play facility, where playgrounds can range from €90,000 to €350,000, high-impact funding targeted at a level which would allow a project to proceed must be provided. Small grants will not enable projects to proceed within Department timeframes. From a Kerry perspective, to enable these developments to proceed and be completed within the current year, I requested that a bloc grant of at least €200,000 be allocated to Kerry County Council.The Minister is reviewing the grant allocation for last year as some of the grants were not taken up. The reason for this is that the grants were not high enough to ensure that communities could purchase equipment as it is so expensive. The communities have to make up remaining funds through fundraising, which they find difficult. Will there be a scheme this year and, if so, when will it be announced? The community of Fenit had to go to the bank to borrow money to buy the equipment which it had already ordered, and other communities will have to do the same. Many progressive and forward-looking communities that have taken the initiative to order equipment are left in limbo because no scheme is available from the Department and there is no immediate hope of funding from Kerry County Council. I hope the Minister of State can give me some good news.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	616	I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising the matter. Obesity in children has been identified as an emerging public health problem, especially in the western world. Data from recent surveys indicate that one in five Irish boys and girls is overweight and one in 20 is obese. Worryingly, the age of onset of obesity in children across the world is falling and a child is twice as likely to be an obese adult if obese in childhood. We need, therefore, as a priority, to address the trend and scale of excess weight and obesity in Irish children. To do that, we need to look at the eating and activity habits of children and what influences these. We need to make it easier for children to eat healthy foods and to be more active.Effective weight management for people at risk of developing obesity involves a range of strategies and opportunities for physical activities. For children, play facilities are very important. Ready, Steady Play: A National Play Policy,which was published in 2004, provides a framework for the development of public play facilities in Ireland, with the overall aim of ensuring that children have access to a range of quality play opportunities to enrich their childhood. The development of the policy by the National Children's Office was as a result of consultation with children and young people who identified the lack of play and recreational opportunities as a major quality of life issue.As part of the implementation of the policy, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was delighted to provide more than €2 million in grant aid to county and city councils in respect of 32 new or refurbished playground projects under the local authority playground grants scheme in 2004. In 2005, the Minister announced funding of a further €2 million for local authorities for the development of playground facilities. A fixed grant of €60,000 was allocated to each county and city council to meet the cost of purchase and delivery of playground equipment. We expect to announce shortly further similar funding for such facilities in 2006. The level of funding should ensure a substantial increase in the overall number of playgrounds in Ireland and we are pleased that we have been able to play our part in responding to the recreational needs of children.Local authorities are empowered under the Local Government Act 2001 to promote the interests of the local community in amenity, recreation and other functions. This includes the provision of sports, games and similar activities and general recreational and leisure facilities such as playgrounds. Apart from the direct grants already mentioned, which assist local authorities in this regard, my Department also provides significant financial support to local authorities through the local government fund, which is usable at the discretion of the authority. With this funding and the revenue generated from development levies, we hope to see many more playgrounds being put in place by local authorities which will make a real difference to the future health of our children.Funding does not all have to come from the special playground grants scheme. Some local authorities specifically ring-fenced a portion of their development levies for playgrounds and other amenities but they had trouble finding suitable areas in which to build the playgrounds, certainly in the greater Dublin area. That was not because there were too many to build but because some residents thought that, while they attracted children by day, they attracted a different element by night. It is hard to find a location that is convenient yet far enough away from residential areas. There might be more room in Kerry.

A scheme is being introduced this year. The Deputy is the expert on Kerry and some of the places I might have driven through on holidays are not huge compared with some of the suburbs in Dublin. However, if there is a local need and a local committee to drive the fund-raising, then the Department and the council might work with them. If it were a matter of a small amount per county per year, some help might be possible. I will talk to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who is in charge of the policy.

These are the Sports Capital Programme and the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.Under the national lottery-funded sports capital programme, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis. The detailed information requested by the Deputy which is provided in the table shows that total of €260.2 million was allocated under the Sports Capital Programme during the period in question to 2,879 projects all around the country and that every county has benefited hugely from this funding.Almost €68 million has been provided in my Department's 2006 Estimates towards the payment of such grants. Almost all of this amount will be in payment of grants allocated in the period specified by the Deputy.In relation to sports capital allocations in 2006, the closing date for receipt of applications was 20th January last. A total of 1,338 applications for projects costing €670 million and seeking funding of €312 million were received by the closing date. All of these applications, ranging in project cost from €500 to €25 million, are currently being evaluated against the programme's detailed assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce in the near future the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.Under the local authority swimming pool programme, grant aid is provided to local authorities in respect of the capital costs of a new swimming pool, a replacement pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. The closing date for receipt of applications under the current round of this Programme was 31 July 2000 and since then a total 57 projects have or are being dealt with. Of the 57 projects, within the Programme, 19 have been completed and 13 pool projects are now under construction or are about to start construction. In addition, 25 other projects are at various stages in the Programme — 7 at tender stage, 10 at contract document stage and 8 at preliminary report stage. It is important to note that expenditure under the programme is largely determined not by my Department, but by the speed at which individual local authorities progress their projects.In the period referred to by the Deputy an amount of €70.267m has expended under the Programme. €32 million has been provided in my Department's vote in respect of this programme for 2006, and so far this year I have allocated a further €11,427,642 towards three swimming pool projects at Portlaoise, Portarlington and Longford.This Government, more than any other Government in the history of the State recognises the benefits which can be achieved through the involvement of people in sport and it has invested significant resources to provide modern well managed and well equipped sporting facilities throughout the length and breath of the country.County2002200320042005TotalCarlow489,000440,000632,000446,0002,007,000Cavan691,200580,0001,075,000785,0003,131,200Clare1,123,0001,125,0001,727,0001,356,0005,331,000Cork7,257,0005,747,4006,524,0008,172,00027,700,400Donegal5,049,0001,177,5001,802,0001,572,0009,600,500Dublin23,075,90014,763,73314,691,00015,739,41968,270,052Galway3,058,0003,058,0003,435,0145,760,00015,311,014Kerry3,335,2003,748,0004,476,0003,603,00015,162,200Kildare4,870,0003,366,0003,357,0001,550,00013,143,000Kilkenny1,116,5001,042,500850,0001,284,0004,293,000Laois1,189,000450,000786,000771,0003,196,000Leitrim821,600454,800479,000660,0002,415,400Limerick2,776,0002,785,5001,925,0003,092,00010,578,500Longford759,400780,000745,000499,0002,783,400Louth2,545,0001,372,1001,644,0001,347,0006,908,100Mayo2,284,0001,574,6001,594,0001,422,0006,874,600Meath1,605,0002,560,0002,260,0001,576,0008,001,000Monaghan1,233,000685,000996,000744,0003,658,000Offaly405,0001,004,0001,157,0001,260,0003,826,000Roscommon1,301,000777,6001,027,000880,0003,985,600Sligo1,527,600963,0001,453,0002,020,0005,963,600Tipperary2,478,0001,657,0002,398,0002,177,0008,710,000Waterford3,253,0002,710,0002,080,0001,425,0009,468,000Westmeath2,569,0001,307,0001,083,0001,305,0006,264,000Wexford2,206,0001,221,0001,887,0002,267,0007,581,000Wicklow1,813,0001,003,0001,700,0001,527,0006,043,000Total78,830,40056,352,73361,783,01463,239,419260,205,566AllocationTotals

Funding from my Department for the Board amounts this year to €17.126M, an increase of 7% on the 2005 figure.My Department's direct role regarding film support relates only to the administration of elements of the Section 481 scheme for investment in film production. Details of the number of films certified under the scheme over the last 5 years are in the table.The Section 481 scheme has recently been enhanced as follows:•the maximum amount that can be raised has increased from €15M to €35M;•the maximum percentage of a project budget that can be raised has increased from between 55% and 66% to 80%.These changes represent the most significant ever enhancement of the scheme, and will greatly increase Ireland's attractiveness as a film making location. The European Commission has in recent days approved these changes to the Section 481 scheme.It is not possible to say at this point in time the number of films that will be made in Ireland over the next four years.Summary of Key Statistics 1994-2006 (to date)Total of Projects certifiedTotal Certified Spendof which Irish SpendSection 481 Amount€m€m€m1994-20012401,294.1697.5581.8200222142.987.962.2200325282.7135.684.8200422119.666.558.1200528125.563.954.82006955.129.428.3Total3462,019.91,080.8870

For 2005 as a whole, domestic holiday trips were up 6.6% to 3.35 million on 2004 and expenditure on domestic travel was up 12% to €1.164bn. This performance is ahead of Fáilte Ireland's target of 4% growth and represents an endorsement by the Irish people of the holiday experience available at home.The home holiday market is an increasingly important component of the tourism business in Ireland. It is particularly important both in terms of seasonal and regional spread. 86% of holiday trips and 89% of holiday nights by domestic tourists are now spent outside the Dublin area which offsets, to some extent, the relative strength of Dublin in the overseas visitors market.As the Irish economy continues to grow, so too has the appetite of the Irish to travel, both at home and abroad. In revenue terms, the home holiday market has grown by 65% since 2000. Irish people are now taking 3.3 million holiday trips in Ireland every year compared to 2.5 million in 2000 an increase of 33%.Recognising the importance of this market, Fáilte Ireland has significantly stepped up its home campaign in recent years, backed by significantly enhanced Exchequer resources. Last month, I launched Fáilte Ireland's "Lets Play" campaign — a 4 million euro home holiday campaign. The campaign, which is now in full swing, calls on Irish people to give themselves more time to use the unexpected pleasures of their own country as a haven from the increasing pressures of modern living. It is centred on the idea of the surprise — those new unexpected elements that one can find in an Irish holiday in whatever part of the country one chooses to visit.The last CSO figures confirm that Irish people continue to value the unique experience they get in Ireland. Allied to our continued good performance in attracting overseas visitors — where last week we saw overseas visitor numbers increasing by 7.7% in the first three months of the year — I am confident that 2006 will prove to be another good year for Irish tourism.

Planning work for Phase One of the Development Control Plan is already underway and will provide:•a National Field Sports training centre, catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey•a National Indoor Training Centre which will provide world class training facilities for over 30 Governing Bodies of Sport•accommodation for sports men and women; sports science and medical facilities•all-weather synthetic pitches for community use; and•renovation of existing buildings to cater for needs identified by sports bodies.Funds for the delivery of the project have been provided in my Department's capital envelope for 2006-2010. The estimated cost of the project is €119m with a 4 to 5-year delivery schedule- 2006 to 2010. An amount of €9.5m has been provided in the Vote of my Department for work on the project during 2006. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Ltd is now proceeding with the delivery of the Abbotstown Sports Campus. Also, as Deputies may be aware, an inter agency study which is chaired by the Office of Public Works, is underway following on from the commitment in the Fingal Development Plan to undertake a study of the feasible developments on the Abbotstown site. I look forward to receiving the outcome of this work in due course.With regard to the National Aquatic Centre, the legal proceedings taken by CSID against Dublin Waterworld Ltd are still before the Courts and it would be inappropriate to comment on matters that are sub-judice. However, it is a matter of public record that the case again came before the Supreme Court on 12 May. The Supreme Court granted a stay of execution on the judgement and order of Mr. Justice Gilligan made on the 21 and 29 March 2006 in the High Court pending the hearing of an appeal.The terms upon which a stay has been granted are as follows:•The defendant to provide security for costs;•The defendant undertakes to keep National Aquatic Centre open and operational;•To continue to pay suppliers and staff;•To operate the 1300 hours agreement as currently operated;•To provide monthly management accounts within 14 days of month end;•To comply with all obligations under the lease subject to matters in contention in the appeal;•To take reasonable steps to prosecute the appeal;•To not remove plant and/or equipment or records and to return any records removed;•To allow reasonable access for snagging to continue.The Supreme Court gave liberty to apply to it in relation to a serious breach of these terms on two working days' notice. The Supreme Court also entered the case on a list to be heard by the Chief Justice on 18 May in relation to granting an early hearing to the appeal.CSID duly made an application for an early hearing of the appeal. On the 18 May, the Chief Justice ordered that the Books of Appeal be lodged within a week and that submissions be lodged within 10 days. He listed the case for mention on 16 June at which stage he will be seeking a date for the hearing. The availability of dates in the legal calendar will determine whether an early hearing can be secured.CSID has prepared contingency plans for the operation of the National Aquatic Centre in the event of it regaining possession.

At my request, the Office of Public Works arranged detailed examination of the site, including archaeological, geotechnical and structural surveys. On the basis of the favourable conclusions emerging from these studies the Government in December 2005 approved the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre at George's Dock and agreed that my Department, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, the Office of Public Works, and the National Development Finance Agency, would examine possible procurement models, including PPP options.KPMG were commissioned to carry out a cost effectiveness study of the proposed relocation of the National Theatre under various procurement options. The conclusions emerging from the KPMG study are currently being evaluated by my Department in consultation with the other Agencies to which I have referred and I expect to be in a position to report back to Government on the issues in the very near future. I am not yet in a position to specify possible commencement and completion dates.

Unfortunately, due to an extremely busy schedule on that date, I was unable to accept the invitation. I suggested, instead, that a representative of Fáilte Ireland be invited to address the conference. I understand that a representative from Fáilte Ireland did, indeed, make a presentation on the Effective Marketing of the Slieve Blooms as a Tourist Destination.Neither I nor my Department is responsible for promoting individual regions of the country. This responsibility rests with Fáilte Ireland and the relevant Regional Tourism Authority. Responsibility for niche tourism marketing, such as eco-tourism, rests with Fáilte Ireland and is delivered in overseas markets by Tourism Ireland.The term Eco-Tourism is a phrase that has been around for about 20 years but there seem to be many definitions. Existing definitions range from emphases on conservation, on experiencing nature, on social conscience to a combination of all of these. There is no doubt that Ireland does have elements of its tourism product that can fit under the eco-tourism banner and I expect that, with the recent creation of a new Environmental Unit within Fáilte Ireland, it will look at developing that area within the context of Fáilte Ireland's overall product development strategy.

This funding is protected by a Deed of Covenant and Charge which provides for a repayment of the grants should the property be sold or cease to be used for sporting proposes.Any decision regarding the club moving from its current location to a purpose built stadium is a matter for the club and its members to decide. Any proposal to develop such a stadium by private developers will be subject to the normal planning process during which the issues raised by local residents will have to be considered.

As the Deputy will be aware, Tourism Ireland is responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas. In delivering its marketing programme last year, Tourism Ireland, which is jointly funded by the Irish and British Exchequers, spent over €35m on advertising, publicity, promotions, e-marketing and brand development. The targets set for 2005 were to grow overall visitor numbers by 4.7% and revenue by 6.5%.CSO data for 2005 show overseas visitor numbers increased by 6% to almost 7 million and a significant rise in revenue — up almost 8% to €3.455 billion, excluding carrier receipts. On both counts, the 2005 targets were exceeded. Against a backdrop of intense global competition and constantly evolving consumer preferences, these results represent a good performance by the sector and underline the significant return which Tourism Ireland achieves from its investment in overseas marketing.Fáilte Ireland is responsible for promoting holidays on the domestic market, which is so important for regional and year-round business. Last year, it spent approximately €4m on the home holiday campaign. CSO figures, just published for the home market, show domestic holiday trips increased by 6.6% to 3.35 million over 2004 and expenditure on domestic travel was up 12% (to €1.164bn). This performance was ahead of the target of 4% growth set by Fáilte Ireland. It constitutes a strong endorsement of expenditure to promote domestic holidays and suggests that the home holiday campaign has been an effective contributor to facilitating that growth.

Representatives of the Equestrian Federation of Ireland, the Irish Horse Board, the Irish Sports Council, the Department of Agriculture and Food and my own Department also participated in the deliberations of the group. Mr. Dowling has drawn up a set of proposals which have been accepted by the group. These proposals are now being referred to the governing bodies of the Agencies involved for adoption by them hopefully by end-June, following which they will be submitted for formal consideration by me.

However, the New Horizons Review of Irish Tourism Policy, published in October 2003, set ambitious growth targets for the industry up to 2012 — namely that it would attract annual visitor numbers of 10 million and €6 billion in foreign revenue by that year. This represents annual average growth rates of 5.4% in visitor numbers and 6.9% in overseas revenue.In terms of regional growth, the Review also set out an equally ambitious target to double the number of overseas promotable visitors staying at least one night in the Border Midland and Western (BMW) region. As the Deputy will know, the so-called promotable segment of the overall tourism market is that which is most susceptible to marketing and promotion efforts. The Review did not disaggregate these targets on a county basis.These targets were established on the basis of a number of assumptions with regard to the economic conditions prevailing in our key overseas markets and our relative competitive position internationally. They are based on a realistic assessment of the prospects for growth in the sector but are also designed to be challenging. It is important to note that these are targets, not forecasts.

However, I understand from the Board that this new office will focus on the promotion of Ireland to the U.S. film industry, with the aim of attracting an increased range of U.S. feature film and television drama to locate in Ireland, bringing with it direct foreign investment.The Office will be headed by a representative of the Irish Film Board with the title of Vice President, Irish Film Commission. This representative will meet regularly with executives within the U.S. Studio system, the independent production community, as well as the network and cable TV sector, to identify and track projects that could locate in Ireland. He/she will regularly report to the Board on current trends in the US film & TV industry. The Irish Film Board is expected to open its new office in Los Angeles in the Autumn.

Phase one of the audit will establish a record of national and regional sports facilities and is being carried out within my Department.The work currently being undertaken by my Department is a data gathering exercise in conjunction with the main sporting bodies and local authorities to identify the facilities for inclusion in this phase. Once this list is finalised a detailed questionnaire seeking the necessary information on the sports facilities will issue to facility owners and managers which will be used to establish a comprehensive database.The intention is that by ascertaining and mapping what is already in place, an important part of developing a strategic approach to future facility provision is put in place as well as establishing the level of need that still exists in the sports sector and helping to determine future priorities. This first phase of the audit is expected to be completed by the end of the year in advance of the 2007 sports capital programme.

Over the years, many sports clubs of all kinds have developed their facilities in very central locations which are strategically placed at the heart of their community. However, in these times of high property prices there is little doubt that clubs of all types are increasingly being tempted to put their current sites on the market for large amounts of money with a view to relocating to more peripheral sites that are nearer the outskirts of the city, town or village in which they are based.On the surface, this can seem to offer significant advantages to these clubs, who may have expanded their membership to such an extent that they no longer have enough space to further develop their facilities on their existing site. Clubs can also benefit from a once-off financial windfall which can seem very attractive and can provide them with the necessary funding to help further develop their facilities, such as more playing space, better training facilities, new and bigger sports halls, clubhouses, improved parking facilities etc.However, I am strongly of the view that such clubs must not forget the central role that they have traditionally played in their local communities. They are of vital importance to the social fabric of those communities to which they are inextricably bound. It is doubtful whether they could continue to play this role to the same extent if they opt to move to peripheral locations. Gaelic games, in particular, define us as a people and it is of immense importance that the GAA continue to play their games and be centrally involved in their community.I believe that sports clubs have a duty to balance their own interests with the interests of the community from which they draw their membership and with which they have such close ties. In considering any offers for their land or sites from developers, therefore, clubs should only consider moving for the most compelling of reasons.

In accordance with the competition process, the Contracting Authority, the Office of Public Works, proceeded to engage with the Provisional Preferred Tenderer to negotiate, settle and agree any required amendments to the project agreement. These detailed and complex negotiations are, by their nature, time consuming but, as I informed the House on 25th April last, I understand that the Contracting Authority is pressing to have them concluded as soon as possible.Assuming that these negotiations prove successful, the next step will be the appointment of the Provisional Preferred Tenderer as Preferred Tenderer. During the Preferred Tenderer phase, the Preferred Tenderer will develop and provide the full range of project documents, which will require review and approval by the Contracting Authority. I look forward to the timely completion of the next stages and hope to be in a position to bring the matter to Government for final decision in the coming months.Subject to the successful completion of the remaining stages of the procurement process and assuming no unexpected developments, I would hope that construction of the National Conference Centre would begin next year and that the Centre would be operational during 2009.

The performance of this market has surpassed the targets in the New Horizons report. The fact that Mainland Europe is now almost on a par with Britain in revenue terms confirms that we are very much on target in relation to the tourism priority in the Agreed Programme for Government which seeks to broaden our source markets particularly Europe.Part of the impressive performance on the Mainland European market has undoubtedly been an increased number of visitors from Central and Eastern European countries. For example, last year there were 127,000 Polish visitors to Ireland representing almost 7% of the total number of visitors from Mainland Europe.Tourism Ireland Ltd is the body responsible for the international marketing of the island of Ireland as a tourist destination. It is already undertaking a wide range of publicity and promotion activities to target new and developing markets in Central and Eastern Europe — capitalising particularly on the increased air access options. This activity includes inward media visits, trade and consumer promotions and developing versions of its new generation Website "www.discoverireland.com” in Polish, Russian, Czech and Hungarian.Access is key driver of tourism growth and according to the latest intelligence from Tourism Ireland, air capacity from Mainland Europe this Summer will be almost double that available in summer 2004. Tourism Ireland estimates that there will be 35,000 additional seats each-way per week available with substantial growth in capacity from Central and East Europe. I am confident that Tourism Ireland will continue to exploit opportunities that are presented to increase visitors from Europe in general and from Central and Eastern Europe in particular.

It contained a very practical Action Plan. It had a time-frame for implementation and, more importantly, a strong and public monitoring mechanism. It contained ambitious targets for the industry, namely to achieve annual figures of 10 million visitors and €6 billion in foreign revenue by 2012. The Action Plan had a series of Recommendations to be implemented to help meet those targets.Following its publication, I appointed the Tourism Action Plan Implementation Group for a two-year period to oversee its implementation. The Final Report of the Tourism Action Plan Implementation Group was presented to me in March. Having placed it before Cabinet, I arranged for its publication and it is available on my Department's website.The Group reported that 63 of the 76 recommendations made in the New Horizons Report, had either been implemented or good progress had been made in relation to them. A detailed analysis of the progress of each of the 76 recommendations is available also on my Department's website.The Group highlighted the areas where good progress has been made. These include•The National Conference Centre,•Increases in air access,•The proposed bilateral air agreement with the US.It also pointed to a number of areas where progress has been less satisfactory. These include•loss of competitiveness,•the need for innovation and product development in the sector,•variations in performance between urban and rural areas,•access to certain parts of the countryside,•the visitor experience at Dublin Airport,•VAT deductibility on conference business.The Implementation Group, expressed itself satisfied with the degree of progress in implementing the strategy which it described as "in many ways better than what was anticipated by the Implementation Group when it first met almost 2 years ago".I have just appointed a successor to the Tourism Action Plan Implementation Group for the next two years. This Tourism Strategy Implementation Group will continue the important work of the Tourism Action Plan Implementation Group taking up where it left off.

Ireland continues to have a prominent presence at the festival through the Irish Film Board, which in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Film Commission, co-sponsors the Irish Pavilion at Cannes. I was delighted to officiate at the formal public launch of the Irish Pavilion in Cannes.The Irish Film Board is at the heart of the Government's strategy to promote indigenous Irish films and film-makers. It is charged with the task of raising Ireland's profile as an attractive location for film making. I was glad to have had the opportunity, while in Cannes, of re-emphasising the benefits of film making in Ireland.In the course of my visit to the Festival, I held a number of meetings with influential figures in the European and international film sector accompanied as necessary, by Irish producers, and Irish Film Board representatives. These meetings included:•Disney producers Paul Steinke and Mary-Ann Hughes;•UK Producer, Greg Brennan from production company Tiger Aspect;•US producer Dean Devlin;•UK producers Douglas Rae, Robert Bernstein of Ecosse Films, co-producers of "Becoming Jane", now in production in Ireland;•Representatives of New Zealand Film Commission;•European co-producers, and financiers.I also met my European Culture Ministerial colleagues and Commissioner Reding and attended a function with the Society of Drama Authors and composers and the Society of Authors, Directors and Producers.I was also pleased to attend the premiere of the Irish co-production film "The Wind that Shakes the Barley," which has since achieved the pinnacle prize of the Festival, the Palme D'Or, of which we are all very proud. This is the true accolade for film in the world each year and I wish to extend my congratulations to the cast and crew of this wonderful film again.

The Great Famine, which was responsible for the death of so many Irish people and which ushered in the age of effective compulsory emigration that has only recently been turned-around, has had a great impact on the Irish psyche and its impact remains tangible to many of the Irish people. I am currently contemplating a Commemoration programme and would hope to take the matter further in the weeks ahead. I am aware that a Committee for the Commemoration of Irish Famine victims requested all people on the island of Ireland to observe a minute's silence at 2 p.m. last Sunday, the 28th May 2006, in memory of victims of the Great Famine.

This is a day-to-day function of Fáilte Ireland under the National Tourism Development Authority Act, 2003. Since taking up my appointment as Minister with responsibility for Tourism, I have met with representative organisations of the bed and breakfasts and guesthouses sector and there is regular contact between such organisations and my Department and the Tourism State Agencies.The key issues affecting the performance of the bed and breakfast sector were examined in a major review commissioned by Fáilte Ireland. This review, which was published in September 2005, identifies the reluctance of younger families to become involved in offering "Irish Home" or B&B type accommodation as other proprietors retire from the business as being a significant factor in the decline in the number of approved premises. The reluctance of younger families stems from a variety of reasons including the options for work outside the home that are available and increases in relative wealth which have lessened the necessity for entering the business.It is also true to say that there have been other contributory factors to the loss in market share of the B&B and Guesthouse sector such as changes in consumer preferences, growth in urban and short-break holiday taking and the large addition of budget hotel accommodation stock.The Deputy will appreciate that just as visitors cannot be compelled to visit particular locations neither can they be obliged to avail of particular products or types of accommodation. The responsibility primarily lies with the individual communities and operators in the sector to identify and market persuasively unique product offerings that will provide the visitor with a quality holiday experience and deliver value for money.Having said that, Fáilte Ireland recognises that staying in an Irish home can be a defining experience for overseas visitors and it is determined to help to ensure that this should remain a significant element of the Irish tourism brand. The importance of the product is reflected in the fact that over half of the 3,000 nominations received in 2005 for Fáilte Ireland's Irish Welcome Awards were in respect of people running B&Bs.Insofar as Government support for the sector is concerned, I understand that Fáilte Ireland has identified a number of actions designed to encourage suppliers to both remain in, and enter the business. In particular the approach to marketing both individual premises and the sector overall is to be refreshed. The Authority is committed to working with the relevant representative bodies and recognised marketing groups to implement the findings of the Strategic Review, a copy of which can be downloaded from Fáilte Ireland's corporate website www.failteireland.ie.

Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time. Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, e.g. people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over. In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services. The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.

The priority, at that time, was to put in place a fair and efficient Hepatitis C compensation scheme on a statutory basis. Attention then turned to the establishment of a Tribunal of Inquiry into the infection with HIV and Hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia (Lindsay Tribunal) and subsequently to the expansion of the compensation scheme to encompass persons infected with HIV.When these matters had been dealt with, intensive consultations took place with the representative groups on the insurance issue. It was first necessary to establish the actual position regarding access to insurance by this cohort, and the potential mechanisms for addressing the difficulties being experienced. Following that, an in-depth examination of the preferred mechanism was necessary, and the parameters of the proposed scheme developed. No similar scheme was found to exist worldwide for any patient group, making the proposed scheme a unique and innovative response by the Government to the needs of persons infected with Hepatitis C and HIV.The process of drafting the legislation to establish the insurance scheme is almost complete. As soon as I receive the final agreed text from my legal advisors, I will submit it to the Government for approval and will publish it as soon as approval is received. The legislation is included as a priority in the Government's Legislative Programme for the current session and it is my firm intention that the enabling legislation will be enacted before the Summer recess.

Kildare was acquired in late 2002. A sketch scheme was forwarded to the Department of Justice, Equality & Law Reform in 2003 for approval. However, significant additional requirements were sought by the Department and in order to accommodate these requirements OPW entered into negotiations with Kildare County Council to acquire an additional piece of land. In May 2005 agreement was reached with Kildare County Council to transfer this plot of land to OPW.Following approval to a revised sketch scheme from the Department of Justice, Equality & Law Reform the Part 9 planning consultation process began in December 2005. Having regard to the large number of observations received an independent architectural report was obtained. This report is currently under consideration and a formal decision by the Commissioners of Public Works is expected shortly. No other sites are currently being considered. The question relating to policy decisions is for answer by the Minister for Justice, Equality & Law Reform.

All matters relating to the Commission are in fact dealt with by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with reference to my Department where appropriate.In common with other Voted expenditure, grants to the HRC are subject in the normal way to the procedures set out in relevant legislation. The usual position is that the Department of Finance sanctions numbers of staff for bodies, having due regard to Government policy at the time, and appropriate rates of remuneration of both staff and Board members. In addition the normal position is that grant or funding levels are also subject to formal sanction. My Department at all times deals with each request on its merits bearing in mind all relevant factors including the need to retain consistency in remuneration structures.Any specific questions relating to resources for the Commission should be directed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	669	Under the Garda Síochána Act the numbers and grades of officers of the Ombudsman Commission are subject to the approval of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Accordingly the Ombudsman Commission itself does not seek my approval. It makes proposals on staffing to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it is then a matter for that Minister to seek my consent to such posts and grades as he deems appropriate. These arrangements are in line with those normally applicable to new bodies created under statute.As of now my consent has been sought for the creation of the following posts in support of the 3-person Commission consisting of Chair and two members:(i) Director of Investigations(ii) Deputy Director of Investigations(iii) Head of Legal Affairs(iv) Assistant Principal to head the IT function(v) Head of Administration.My consent has been conveyed in respect of posts (i) to (iv) above and also in principle subject to ongoing discussions for item (v). Permission has not been refused in respect of any post. I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will, in early course, be seeking further Investigators and Administrative staff in various grades. At present, the Commission also have the services of a Transitional Team consisting of 1 Principal, 2 Assistant Principal Officers, 2 Higher Executive Officers and 2 Clerical Officers. This is to help them establish their main and regional headquarters and to recruit and train their full complement of permanent staff, especially investigative staff, some of whom are likely to be recruited abroad.

In the case of combined cards (cards which have both ATM and Debit functions), the stamp duty is €20.The Deputy will be aware that I introduced changes in this year's Finance Act to alter the way that stamp duty is charged on combined cards. The stamp duty on a combined card was reduced to €10 per annum where the card is only used for one function (either ATM transactions or debit transactions) throughout the year.Stamp duty on ATM cards has existed for some time, whereas stamp duty on debit cards was only introduced for 2003 et seq. The yield from stamp duty on ATM, debit and combined cards is shown in the table.YearATM CardsCombined CardsDebit CardsTotal€m€m€m€m200113.013.0200214.014.0200321.79.21.832.7200421.0511.82.435.3200522.412.153.337.9The ATM duty on combined cards for 2001 and 2002 is included in the statistics provided for ATM cards for those years.I am not aware of any other EU Member States imposing taxation on financial cards.Stamp duty exists on various financial cards in order to provide Exchequer revenue. The stamp duty on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes has existed for many years and when electronic means of money transfers were subsequently introduced, stamp duty was gradually extended to these products to ensure that the stamp duty from cheques etc. was not eroded. The stamp duty applies irrespective of the volume of bank transactions made.Stamp duties on financial cards are significant contributors to the Exchequer and are in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates generally low.

These regulations require my consent as Minister for Communications, under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926 and should be in place shortly.ComReg recently met with representatives of the Catholic Church to explain the proposed new scheme to them. I understand from ComReg that the Church representatives expressed satisfaction with the new arrangements.ComReg also advised the Church representatives that while they have not required churches to discontinue relaying services they would expect all parishes to comply with the new licensing arrangements once the regulations have been signed and come into force.I would recommend any local church authorities who wish to make services available in local parishes through radio to contact ComReg directly. www.comreg.ie.

I am aware through the Western Regional Fisheries Board and the Central Fisheries Board that an alien plant species known as Lagarosiphon major or Curly Water Weed, referred to by the Deputy, has been identified in Lough Corrib.I am advised by the Central Fisheries Board that Lagarosiphon major was definitively identified in Rinneroon Bay, Lough Corrib, in April 2005. Discussions with local Fisheries Board staff and anglers suggest that the plant may have been present in the bay for between 5 and 7 years, but only achieved nuisance levels in the past two years. The reason it was not brought to the attention of Central Fisheries Board scientists prior to 2005 was because it was thought to be part of the native flora. As a result of research conducted since the plant was first positively identified in Lough Corrib, it would appear that this represents the only location where Lagarosiphon has established in the wild.Once positively identified an information leaflet that detailed the ecological and recreational consequences of the plant's spread was produced and distributed widely throughout the country.I am advised that the Central Fisheries Board and the Western Regional Fisheries Board, together with Galway County Council and the National Parks and Wild Life Service, established a Lagarosiphon Task Force last year. The main aim of this task force is to determine and implement all the possible options for the control and the possible elimination of this invasive alien species. I understand that the Task Force will shortly be submitting proposals on measures to deal with this problem.

Tourism Ireland was also instrumental in attracting a highly-popular South African soap series to film material in Wicklow recently.Considerable potential exists for collaboration between Tourism Ireland and the Irish Film Board in the Indian film market and Ireland has experienced some initial interest as a location for ‘Bollywood' productions. Following my recent visit to India in January, I was delighted to welcome a delegation of Indian film producers to Ireland in April.The benefits to be gained from bringing such productions to Ireland, in terms of tourism, can be gauged from the fact that it is estimated that Switzerland attracts about 75,000 visitors from India each year and the filming of ‘Bollywood' productions in the country is a major factor in this.The recent approval by the European Commission of the enhancements the Government have made to the section 481 scheme for investment in film production will underline the attractiveness of Ireland to film-makers and can only serve to improve the potential gains to tourism from such activity.

A further €14.5 million in capital expenditure is also available to my Department by way of a deferred surrender of capital savings in 2005, bringing the total sports provision in 2006 to €243.295 million.The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of providing capital funding for sports facilities to clubs and voluntary and community organisations in every county throughout the country. The Programme is advertised on an annual basis.In 2005 a total of €56.8 million was paid out in respect of grants allocated under the Sports Capital Programmes. Since 1998 a total of €395 million has now been allocated to 4,923 projects throughout the country providing for the needs of organisations and participants in the areas of physical recreation, training, coaching and competition at all levels of sport in Ireland. Almost €68 million has been provided in the 2006 Estimates for the provision of sport and physical recreational facilities. A total of 1,338 applications for funding under the 2006 sports capital programme were received and are being assessed in my Department. I will be announcing the allocations for 2006 as soon as the assessment process is completed.In terms of urban and rural disadvantage under the sports capital programme, the designated areas since 2002 are those that have been selected by Government for special support through the RAPID 1, RAPID 2, Local Drugs Task Force and CLÁR Programmes. These programmes are all managed by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (DCRGA).Applications from disadvantaged areas score higher during assessment of sports capital projects and are also required to have less of minimum funding (20% of the project cost rather than 30%). Over the period 2001 to 2005, a total of €141 million was allocated under the Sports Capital Programme to almost 1,500 projects in respect of the provision of facilities in areas categorised as disadvantaged.In addition, projects in designated disadvantaged areas that have been allocated sports capital funding may also qualify to receive additional top-up funding under the CLÁR and RAPID programmes. In 2005, DCRGA announced €1.092 million in top-ups for sports capital programme grantees under the 2005 programme located in CLÁR areas and €2.257 million for sports capital programme grantees located in RAPID areas.In 2005, €14.1 million was spent under my Department's Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme supporting the construction/ refurbishment of public swimming pools. So far in 2006, I have approved grant aid for 3 projects and contract documents for 5 projects and one pool in Drogheda has just opened. In 2006, €32.3 million has been provided in my Department's vote in respect of this programme, and so far this year I have allocated €11,427,642 towards three swimming pool projects at Portlaoise, Portarlington and Longford.The Irish Sports Council was established in 1999 as the statutory body responsible for the promotion and development of sport in Ireland. It spent more than €34 million in 2005 on initiating, developing and enhancing a wide range of programmes aimed at increasing participation and raising standards in Irish sport. Almost €41 million has been allocated to the Council for 2006, which will ensure the continuation of its work in advancing and supporting sport at all levels in Ireland.This unprecedented level of investment in sport is clear evidence of the importance which the Government attaches to the putting in place of modern well equipped and well managed sporting facilities supported by a wide range of programmes which are having a real benefit in our communities.

The programme is advertised on an annual basis.Primary and post-primary schools wishing to be considered for funding under the programme may only apply for funding jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must meet other conditions including a requirement that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility, at least 30 hours a week throughout the year, when it is not being used by the school itself. Any sports facility proposed for funding by a sporting organisation and which would be located within school grounds must meet these same conditions.While my Department has no data available to it regarding sporting or recreational facilities that may be located adjacent to schools, grant allocations under the Sports Capital Programme to applications for funding made in conjunction with schools since my Department was formed are as follows: 2003, €400,000; 2004, €637,000; 2005, €634,000.

Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:•to stimulate public interest in the arts;•to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts;•to assist in improving standards in the arts.Neither my Department nor I have a function in deciding on the extent of Arts Council funding for particular projects or venues. Indeed, the Arts Act, 2003, underpins the Council's independence in this context. Funding for the Arts Council in 2006 comes to €72.31 million, an increase of nine per cent on the 2005 figure. Under the Arts Act, 2003 I have the power to issue policy direction to the Arts Council.My Department provides capital grants for arts and culture infrastructure around the country. The main vehicle for such capital funding is the Arts & Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS), under which almost €43 million was provided to arts and cultural facilities around the country. This scheme commenced in 2001 and many projects are still in the course of completion.It is hoped to make an announcement shortly regarding a possible successor to the ACCESS scheme. Applications for any such scheme will be invited by public advertisement.

Domestic tourism has also shown robust growth. It is true that all regions have not benefited equally from recent growth in tourism and this continues to be a matter receiving attention from both my Department and the State tourism agencies.Just over a year ago Fáilte Ireland commissioned PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) to conduct a major study of regional tourism structures. The report was published last year and is available on the Fáilte Ireland Website. This work was supplemented by a short engagement, facilitated by a small independent group chaired by Mr. John Travers, with the relevant parties in order to satisfy interests in the Dublin region that the mechanisms of consultation were complete.At the end of July last, I authorised Fáilte Ireland to proceed with the proposed revision of regional tourism structures on the basis of the PWC and Travers reports. To assist this process, Fáilte Ireland set up an Implementation Group under the chairmanship of Mr. Finbarr Flood. The Group has completed an extensive process of engagement with the existing Regional Tourism Authorities, industry representative groups and other relevant parties, in order to smooth the process of implementation. I understand that the Group recently presented its report to Fáilte Ireland and that Fáilte Ireland is now acting on its contents.I also understand that Fáilte Ireland is gearing up its own internal structures to line up with the proposed new structures at regional level. A new senior management position of Director of Regional Development is expected to be filled very shortly and a due diligence process with each of the RTAs is almost complete.Fáilte Ireland has advised me that it expects that the changes will be implemented in the regions by the end of the summer.

Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.The scheme has been improved in recent budgets. The means test has been eased and the duration of payment increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. Budget 2006 provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of EUR 5.00 from EUR 9.00 to EUR 14.00 (EUR 17.90 in designated smokeless areas). Some 264,400 customers (145,800 with basic fuel allowance and 118,600 with smokeless fuel supplement) will benefit in 2006 at an estimated cost of EUR 125.1m.Fuel allowances are incorporated in the recipient's weekly social welfare payment. Budget resources have been concentrated on providing significant real increases over and above inflation each year in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates. This approach delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their income in real terms over the whole year, to better assist them in meeting their normal basic living costs, including heating.In addition to the fuel allowance, over 320,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of EUR 109 million in 2005.As currently structured, these allowances are linked to unit energy consumption, so that these people are protected against unit price increases in electricity or gas. If an individual has an exceptional heating cost by virtue of a particular infirmity or medical which they are unable to meet out of household income, it is open to them to apply to their local community welfare officer or a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.Any changes to the Fuel Allowance Scheme or any other initiatives on fuel charges would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of future Budgets and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.

Just over €245m has been allocated for this work since 1997.Approximately €125m has been allocated to support in the region of 440 projects contained in the two rounds of plans of the 14 Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs) in the areas of treatment and rehabilitation, education, prevention, awareness and curbing local supply. On top of this, about €3.1m has recently been allocated to 54 projects under an Emerging Needs Fund in these areas.Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) have been established in areas not covered by LDTFs. A sum of €5m has been allocated to these RDTFs to progress implementation of their plans for 2006. Funding will be increased on an incremental basis over the coming years to achieve the full roll out of these action plans, which are estimated to have a full cost in the region of €12.2m per annum.Under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, established to assist the development of youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, approximately €102m has been allocated to date.Approximately €13.66m has been allocated to 60 capital projects under the Premises Initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of which are in LDTF areas. The Premises Initiative has now been extended to include RDTF areas.Overall I am pleased with the increasing levels of funding being made available to tackle the problems of drug misuse. An allocation of €43m has been made to the Department's Vote for the Drugs Initiative/Young People's Facilities and Services Fund in 2006. This represents an increase of 37% on the original 2005 allocation and a massive 61% increase on the 2004 figure. I am satisfied that this will allow us to continue to tackle the drugs problem in a comprehensive way.

In the intervening years approximately €102 million has been allocated to support over 450 facility and services projects in these locations.The possibility of expanding the number of urban areas that are eligible for funding from Young Peoples Facilities & Services Fund may fall to be considered in the coming period. Any decision in that regard would be based on evidence of a significant existing drug problem in a particular centre, or the potential for a drug problem to develop there.I cannot say at this point whether Clonmel would be qualify for inclusion under the Young Peoples Facilities & Services in such circumstances.

The relevant EU Council Regulation provides that at least 10% of the restructuring aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors who have worked under contract with their agricultural machinery for the growers. That percentage may be increased by Member States after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. In that context, my Department has recently issued an open call for submissions which will be subject to scrutiny by Indecon International Economic Consultants who have been appointed by the Government to provide me with independent expert advice on matters relating to the implementation of the restructuring aid. I would urge interested parties to avail of this consultation process where appropriate. A final decision on the percentage will be made in due course having regard to this advice and following the adoption in the near future of the Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid.The timescale for implementing the restructuring aid is very tight where restructuring takes place in the first year of the new regime especially having regard to the fact that the Commission regulations are not yet finalised. The Council Regulation requires that the application for restructuring aid must be made by the processor by 31 July 2006. The application must include a detailed restructuring plan for the industry. A decision on the granting of the aid must then be made by the Member State by 30 September 2006 at the latest.It is my intention that the restructuring aid will be implemented in a fair and equitable manner and strictly in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.

C visas are granted for visits of less than 90 days. As a consequence it is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a C visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. It would appear that the mother of the individuals concerned is seeking an extension of their permission to remain in the State.A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form. That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted.Every visa applicant is required to state on the application form the dates on which he or she proposes to enter and leave Ireland. He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete.An application for permission to remain on behalf of the persons who are the subject of this question is currently being processed by the Immigration Division of my Department. A decision in relation to this matter will issue to the applicant shortly.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I informed the Deputy in response to his earlier question that the couple concerned had been granted permission to remain in the State on foot of their parentage of an Irish born child in July 2000. This permission was granted for a period of 12 months initially and required the couple to register such permission with the Garda Síochána. I understand that the couple formalised their permission to remain with the Garda Síochána on the 19 July 2000 and were granted permission to remain until 13 July 2001. A copy of their Garda certificates of Registration, which they submitted in support of their applications, confirmed this.The couple maintain in correspondence to my Department that they renewed their permission to remain in July 2001 at the Garda National Immigration Bureau's former offices at Harcourt Square, Dublin 2. However, the copy of their Garda Certificates of Registration do not carry any stamps from that office for that period. The Garda National Immigration Bureau commenced computerising their registration records in 2001/2002. The first record of the couple renewing their permission after 13 July 2001 is 11 June 2002. Consequently, there does not appear to be any record of the couple having permission to remain in the State for the period August 2001 to May 2002. As a result, this period cannot be reckoned for the purposes of naturalisation.

The court also ordered compensation to be paid, and I understand this was done. As the Deputy is aware, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and it is not open to me to comment or intervene in any way on the conduct or decision of any individual court case which is entirely a matter for the presiding judge.While I am sympathetic to the distress caused to the victim and the victim's family by this crime, I consider that a meeting would not serve any beneficial purpose.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	706	Under Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996, an asylum applicant shall not seek or enter employment before the final determination of his or her application for a declaration of refugee status. It is not proposed to allow asylum applicants take up paid employment pending a final decision being made on their applications.I am convinced that any extension of the right to work generally to asylum applicants would greatly undermine the considerable progress which has been made at both first instance and appeals in relation to the processing of asylum applications arising from the Government's asylum strategy, which has resulted in more speedy decisions in relation to applications. All applicants are notified of their interview date by ORAC at the time they make their application. The interview appointment is normally within 20 days of the application date. However, for applications within the prioritised category, interviews in ORAC are held more speedily, within 9-12 days. The number of applications over six months in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal at the end of April 2006 stood at 524 as compared to some 6500 at the end of September 2001.I believe that granting asylum seekers access to the labour market would have a negative impact on asylum applications, which fell by some 40% in 2004 and a further 9% in 2005 and indeed would act as a pull factor. In terms of the number of unfounded applications being received, such a move would also increase pressure on the capacity of the Reception and Integration Agency to accommodate asylum seekers.By way of illustration in relation to pull factors, I would refer the Deputies to the fact that a considerable increase in asylum numbers was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to allow asylum seekers access to the labour market. This led to a three-fold increase in the average number of applications per month, rising to 1,217 applications in December 1999 as compared to an average of 364 per month for the period January to July 1999.Any proposal to grant asylum seekers access to the labour market would also undermine the current and effective work permit system which provides a comprehensive channel for legal migration, for economic or other reasons, to the State.It is a well established fact that those engaged in trafficking and those seeking to access the labour market without going through the appropriate legal channels are very quick to identify any perceived attractiveness of a country as a preferred or easily accessed destination. It is my very strong belief that any extension of the right to work to asylum applicants would be portrayed abroad by people traffickers to potential victims as a guarantee of an attractive job in Ireland.I firmly believe that the greatest service we can provide to those who should be recognised as refugees is to ensure that their claims are decided speedily and that nothing is done which undermines this policy priority by attracting large numbers of non-genuine applicants to the detriment of genuine applicants. The structures currently in place provide the State with an asylum system that meets the highest international standards and fulfils our international obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention. Overloading the process with large numbers of new applicants who come here under the misguided expectation that they will be able to work could completely undermine the major investment of resources which has gone into bringing our overall system to its current status.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I do not accept that the Irish asylum system lacks fairness and transparency.As the Deputy is aware, there is a transparent statutory framework governing the asylum determination process in Ireland set out in the Refugee Act 1996. The 1996 Act established two independent statutory offices to consider applications and appeals in respect of refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. These offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT). The asylum process now in place in this State is comprehensive and compares well with other industrialised countries. Indeed this fact was recently acknowledged by a former UNHCR Representative to Ireland who is quoted as stating that Ireland is now a model for the new Member States of the European Union and that "we now have a system which, in many respects, is one of the best in Europe".Both agencies are highly resourced and staff members receive specialised, UNHCR-based training before processing cases. Due regard is also had to particularly vulnerable applicants, such as minors or victims of trauma, and appropriate training is given towards the sensitive processing of such claims.When an applicant claims asylum, that applicant is provided with all the necessary information governing the asylum process, including a detailed information leaflet which is available in 31 languages.Every asylum applicant is guaranteed an investigation and determination of his or her claim at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner. Each application is assessed on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case and having regard to both the subjective elements (the applicant's own account or personal history) and objective elements (up-to-date information on the applicant's country or place of origin). This country of origin information comes from a wide variety of objective and respected sources, including organisations such as the UNHCR, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, UK Home Office, Canadian International Refugee Board, US State Department and other EU member states as well as media and internet sources.In the event of a negative recommendation at first instance, our system also guarantees every asylum applicant a right of appeal to the independent Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Every appellant is furnished with a copy (in a language of their own country where possible) of the Tribunal's information leaflet, which sets out the appeals process in full.It is important to note that under section 13 of the Refugee Act 1996, a copy of the Refugee Applications Commissioner's report, containing the findings and recommendation of the Commissioner, is sent to the applicant concerned and his or her solicitor (if known). The applicant, prior to submitting an appeal, is also furnished with all other relevant ORAC papers, such as the notes of the first instance interview. Similarly, under section 16 of the 1996 Act, the decision of the RAT is communicated to the applicant concerned and his or her solicitor. This indicates all the relevant papers which have been taken into account (and evidence adduced at the oral hearing where relevant) in reaching the decision, which also sets out the reasons for either affirming or setting aside the Commissioner's recommendation.The transparency of the appeals process was enhanced on 31 March this year when a selection of decisions of the RAT were published, pursuant to section 19 of the 1996 Act. It is the intention of the Chairperson of RAT to publish further decisions on an ongoing basis into the future.Also important to note in terms of fairness is that access to legal assistance at all stages of the process is provided by the Refugee Legal Service and, under the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996, UNHCR is given full access to our refugee determination process.In addition to a comprehensive first instance determination and an appeal, applicants have the opportunity to access the courts by seeking judicial review on procedural aspects of the decision-making.Over recent years, very considerable work has been undertaken in ORAC and the RAT to deal with applications for asylum and to speed up processing times. The work involved has resulted in a situation where: Processing has continued to move strongly in both ORAC and RAT. At the end of April 2006 there were 2,593 cases on hand in both agencies compared to some 5,542 cases on hand at the end of April 2004. The number of applications over six months in ORAC and RAT at the end of April 2006 stood at 524 as compared to some 6,500 at the end of September 2001. The backlog of applications has been effectively eliminated in ORAC with only 55 cases on hand over six months at the end of April 2006 and some 469 in RAT; a significant number of which are at an advanced stage of processing. There is continued momentum in processing timescales for asylum applications with arrangements for the speedier processing of prioritised asylum applications (from nationals of Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and South Africa) introduced in January 2005, with an 18 working day processing time at first instance in ORAC and 15 working days at appeals stage in RAT. Currently, approximately 40% of total applications fall into the prioritised category. With effect from 1 November 2005, all applicants for asylum are notified of their interview date by ORAC at the time they make their applications. The interview appointment is normally within 20 working days of application. However, for those applicants within the prioritised category, interviews in ORAC are held, more speedily, within 9 to 12 days. The typical processing time in the ORAC for non-prioritised cases is in the region of 8-9 weeks. The average length of time taken to process and complete substantive appeals in the RAT is approximately 14 weeks.In April 2005, I published a public Consultation Document setting out outline policy proposals for an Immigration and Residence Bill. This document noted that the State is required to introduce a subsidiary protection regime under EU law later this year. This provides an opportunity of which I intend to avail to re-examine, in the light of the experience of the last decade, how protection claims are dealt with under present law including at appeals stage. I will be bringing proposals to Government in this regard in the coming weeks.

The Deputy must appreciate though that this may not always be possible for a number of reasons, for example, security factors, an offender's ability to engage effectively with a service recommended or simply by the prisoner refusing to engage with the appropriate services.Anger Management group programmes have been provided in a number of institutions. In addition to these specific Anger Management courses, which were run by the Psychology and Probation & Welfare Services, there are also other interventions available in many prisons addressing anger issues for prisoners. These include the Alternatives to Violence courses and the generic therapeutic services provided on a one-to-one and group basis by the Psychology and Probation & Welfare Service. Also, courses aimed at addressing offending behaviour, such as the Sex Offender Programme, do, as appropriate, address anger issues. The number of offenders undergoing interventions targeting anger is not recorded centrally in the Irish Prison Service.Finally, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the confidential therapeutic processes undertaken by an individual prisoner.

The number of teachers allocated to the school by my Department is determined by the numbers of students enrolled on the programmes concerned. Schools are encouraged to provide maximum access to these options and to have clear procedures in place regarding how the available places are allocated to students.The school referred to by the Deputy is currently participating in the Stay in School Retention strand of the School Completion Programme. This strand provides funding to participating post primary schools on the basis of annual retention plans drawn up between the schools and the Department. The intention is to empower the schools themselves to tackle early school leaving. The plans provide for a range of targeted measures directed at the particular needs of the individual schools, together with clear targets in terms of increased retention. This school has accepted an invitation to participate in the new School Support Programme under DEIS.The school referred to by the Deputy currently offers a varied senior cycle with Transition Year, Leaving Certificate Applied and the established Leaving Certificate as options. I understand that having gone through the selection process for LCA the student in question was not offered one of the available places.I also understand that the student in question did not apply for Transition Year. My Department has been informed by the school authorities that this remains an option which the parent of the student can explore with the school.

The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.The revised staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year (Circular 0023/2006) has been issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department's website.According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30th September, 2005 was 180 pupils. On the basis of this figure, the mainstream staffing for the 2006/07 school year will be a Principal and 7 mainstream class teachers.The question of sanctioning a concessionary mainstream post for the 2006/7 school year is being considered by my Department and the school authorities will be notified of the decision in due course.

The reason the decision was deferred at the time that the list of new schools was announced was to allow for consideration of the impact that recognising this school would have on the existing schools in Blessington, plans for the expansion of which are well advanced. The New Schools Advisory Committee recommended in their report to me that this issue be considered.The Chairperson of the Commission on School Accommodation is carrying out a review and further analysis of key data in relation to the population projections for the Blessington area and this will be completed within days.I am very conscious of the need for a decision to be made as soon as possible so that parents know what the situation will be for September and that is why I have put a deadline on issuing one.

At present, there is a total of 75 Blocks (one Block provides for 16 apprentice places) of apprentice training provided countrywide in the trade of plumbing. Overall, the number of Plumbing Blocks provided in the Institutes of Technology has increased from 46 in the 2000/2001 academic year to 75 in the current academic year.Notwithstanding this increase in training capacity, the level of registrations in plumbing apprenticeship remains high. Over the last number of years, my Department has also provided funding to Institutes to run additional apprentice courses during the summer months across a number of trades, including plumbing. While funding was again available this year for summer courses, it was not possible to reach agreement with the TUI on the provision of these courses.My Department continues to liaise with FÁS, the Institutes of Technology and other interested parties in order to ensure that national training needs are met. In this regard, my Department has received proposals from a number of Institutes that are interested in increasing their capacity. These proposals are currently being examined in the light of available resources.

My Department is at present giving consideration to these requests and to other applications made for youth work funding in 2006, having regard to the overall level of financial resources available for the youth work sector.With regard to the Youth Work Act, 2001, this provides a legal framework for the provision of youth work programmes and services to be organised by the Minister for Education and Science, the Vocational Education Committees and national and regional youth work organisations.A sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, representative of both statutory and voluntary sectors as well as my Department, has been steadily progressing the groundwork, including the development of detailed guidelines and procedures, which are vital for the further rollout of the Act in a planned and structured manner. The work of this sub-committee is continuing.An area which is currently receiving priority attention is the capacity development of Vocational Education Committees (VECs) to carry out their responsibilities under the terms of the Act. I am pleased that progress has been made in this regard. A structure for the resourcing of VECs to carry out the functions set out for them under the Act has been agreed, in principle, between my Department and the Irish Vocational Education Association, and I propose to approve a number of additional Youth Officer posts to VECs in this regard. The additional resources being provided to the VEC sector in 2006 will allow for the progressive roll out of the Act at local level in all VEC areas.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	715	At the outset, I want to state emphatically that no school has been told that they are going to lose any of the resources that they have been receiving under existing schemes for tackling disadvantage as a result of the introduction of the new DEIS initiative. On the contrary, the new School Support Programme is aimed at providing even more extra resources for the most disadvantaged schools in the country.Schools that did not qualify for the new programme will keep the extra resources they are getting under existing schemes for the 2006/07 school year and after that they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.The new DEIS programme will be of huge benefit to schools in Donegal. 5 urban/town primary schools, 74 rural primary schools and 12 second — level schools in Donegal have been invited to benefit from all the resources available from the new programme. Indeed the largest number of rural schools invited to benefit from the new programme in any county are in Donegal. I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to make sure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities get all the extra support possible and will welcome the extra resources that DEIS will provide for Donegal schools.It is precisely with this goal in mind that DEIS was designed. For example, over the years, no less than 8 separate schemes for disadvantaged primary schools have been put in place. Some schools were benefiting from just one or two of these and others were benefiting from more. The DEIS initiative is designed to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from a comprehensive package of supports, while ensuring that others continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.I can assure the Deputy that there is no reason for schools that haven't been identified for the new programme to worry as they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils. No school in Donegal has been told that they will lose any resources as a result of DEIS.A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the Programme. This mechanism will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday 31st March, 2006.The review process is underway and it is intended that it will be completed by the end of the current school year.

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. The package includes special nationally agreed rates of remuneration for teachers and special needs assistants involved in the July Programme. Participating schools also receive a special rate of capitation funding in respect of pupils participating in the programme. Funding is also available to facilitate the provision of school transport and escort services for the children. All relevant schools were advised of the detailed funding arrangements applicable to the July Education Programme when the service was introduced in July, 2001.My Department encourages all eligible schools to participate in this initiative in the interest of the children in question. Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.

Investment losses sustained in the relevant tax year are deductible.Where income is paid out annually, as happens with a bank deposit account, the amount so paid is required to be included in reckonable income. Where income is not paid out annually but is "rolled-up" and paid out with the original investment at the end of a defined term, the annual amount required to be included in reckonable income is the "rolled-up" income divided by the number of years in the term of the investment. This procedure has been in place for the past ten years.Given its similarity with "roll-up" savings products it was deemed appropriate to include, as reckonable income, income from SSIAs on an annual basis. The treatment of the SSIAs in this regard is consistent with the treatment of similar financial products such as Post Office Savings Certificates.

In addition, in June 2001 circular letter M46/01 issued to all Boards of Management informing them of the Department's initiative and advising schools on the course of action necessary for radon mitigation.During the course of the survey, 4,072 schools were invited to participate. A report published by the RPII in May 2004 showed that approximately 7% of schools tested in Co. Kildare had radon levels in excess of 400 Bq/m3. The RPII wrote to each of these schools, enclosing a copy of the test results, and advising that the results of the survey be made available to all staff and parents. It was also recommended that a copy of the results be filed in the school's Health & Safety Manual for future reference.The radon reference set for the workplace under the "Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000" (Statutory Instrument 125 of 2000)) is 400 Bq/m3. Notwithstanding the fact that the radon reference for workplaces is 400 Bq/m3, the Department issues grants to schools for the installation of suitable vents in classrooms where radon levels are between 200 Bq/m3 and 400 Bq/m3.Schools with levels above 400 Bq/m3 are advised to secure the services of a suitably qualified consultant architect/engineer to carry out all necessary remedial works and these works are fully funded by the Department.Following completion of remediation works, post remediation measurements are carried out by the RPII to determine if the remediation has been effective. This process is ongoing and the RPII continue to carry out post remediation testing in schools.Radon barriers are included in the design of all new school building projects.

I am not in a position to provide a comparative cost of purchasing the equivalent number of portacabins in this instance. Expenditure on the rental of temporary school accommodation, is as follows: 2001: €6.1m; 2002: €8.4m; 2003: €9.4m; 2004: €11.3m; 2005: €15.7m. To put these figures in context, the Deputy may be interested to know that in 2005, expenditure on rental of temporary accommodation represented less than 3.2% of the total expenditure on school buildings (€501m).The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools. The provision of rented accommodation provides an immediate solution to a deficit of school accommodation, and is often the only available option where extra accommodation is needed at short notice.However, the current focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new devolved initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. Since the introduction of the evolved initiative over 200 schools have been allocated funding under this scheme.

My Department supports the local fire authorities through the setting of general policy, the provision of capital funding, the issue of guidance to fire authorities in relation to fire prevention and operational matters and other such initiatives. In particular, the Fire Services Change Programme, which I announced in 2005, is taking forward a range of initiatives to improve the quality of the service, including through a strengthened focus on community fire safety.Over the past 25 years, almost €240 million has been provided to local fire authorities under the fire services capital programme for the provision of new and refurbished fire stations and new regional communications centres and the purchase of fire appliances and other equipment, including communications equipment. At this stage, over two-thirds of our fire stations, including almost all of the busiest stations, have been replaced. We have a modern fleet of front-line fire appliances, and a modern emergency response communications system is in place. In the current year, almost €20 million has been allocated to the Fire Services capital programme. This allocation will be used to further modernise and update the resources available to the fire authorities.In addition, since 2001, my Department has provided almost €4.2 billion in general purpose grants to assist local authorities in carrying out their statutory functions, including the provision of fire services.
