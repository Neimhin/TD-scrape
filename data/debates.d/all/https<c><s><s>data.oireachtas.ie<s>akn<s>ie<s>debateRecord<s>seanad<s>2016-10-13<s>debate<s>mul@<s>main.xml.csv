I am quite sure he is aware of the ongoing issues in the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital. In the past few years, as an active representative and a Member of the Oireachtas, I have visited the emergency department on a number of occasions and met staff there and senior management. What senior management has told me in stark terms is that the emergency department is physically not fit for purpose. There are also other issues. There are staffing issues, with the fact that the demographics indicate that patients are particularly elderly. These are eminent staff who are experts in the field. They know their hospital well and care for their patients extremely well. Anybody who has visited it will attest to the fact that the physical environment of the emergency department is not up to standard and if the senior management team in the hospital is stating it is not safe and that they cannot stand over it, clearly something has to happen. We are obviously in a period where the Exchequer is in a healthier place. Hospital management has put together a plan. It has a vision of investment in the emergency department to bring it up to standard and provide a much better service for the local community in Dublin and the wider region. It has estimated the cost at €45 million. The previous Government, in the guise of the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and me, met senior management. We were in a position to commit to working with senior management to deliver the plan, that the investment would happen and that the emergency department would be reconfigured and reconstructed in order to be a much better physical fit for the hospital. I have been running a local campaign in which constituents who want to see the investment happen have been engaging. Have the Minister for Health and the Department committed to implementation of this €45 million plan? Has the Minister met senior management? Is it part of the Estimates process? Is it something that will be delivered in the short to medium term because anybody who has visited the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital will realise what is happening there cannot continue? While I did not see anything in the Estimates process and the budget announcements about Beaumont Hospital, I was eager to have this discussion today because, before we head into the winter months, it is important for the staff in Beaumont Hospital and the wider community to know that the Government takes this issue seriously and wants to deliver a better service in the hospital.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	6	I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. It is appropriate because I have just come from a meeting in Hawkins House. I will deal with the response to the points made about the Beaumont Hospital issue later in my contribution. This has been an exceptionally busy year in acute hospitals. The increase in hospital activity can be seen across the board, particularly in emergency departments.To date this year the Health Service Executive, HSE, has reported an average increase of approximately 5% in patient attendance at emergency departments. This increased demand is being driven in part by demographics and an ageing population profile. In that context, it is worth noting that the 2016 census identified 8% growth since 2011 in the population of Fingal which is predominantly served by Beaumont Hospital. Being cognisant of the current demands on Beaumont Hospital's emergency department and projected population growth in the area, the development of a new emergency department at the hospital has been identified as a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government. It is noteworthy that A Programme for a Partnership Government also commits to proceeding to the design and planning stage for a dedicated cystic fibrosis unit at Beaumont Hospital for inclusion in the 2017 capital plan review. The HSE's cystic fibrosis clinical programme is developing a cystic fibrosis model of care that will be important in ensuring the unit proposed for Beaumont Hospital will meet the needs of patients and the health service. It is my understanding both of these projects are also a priority for Beaumont Hospital and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland hospital group, of which it is part. As such, Beaumont Hospital is in the process of finalising business cases for these new developments. The business cases will be reviewed by the HSE's capital and property steering group which approves projects for inclusion in its multi-annual capital plans in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines. As part of this process, funding provision will be made available for the planning and design phases of the proposed new developments in preparation for the capital plan review in 2017. I also mention that as part of the recently published winter initiative for 2016 to 2017, Beaumont Hospital will be provided with the resources to open ten additional beds to increase capacity in order to support its emergency department during the crucial winter period to meet the expected surge in volume. Furthermore, under this initiative, funding has also been provided to expand community intervention teams, additional home care packages and transitional care beds in north Dublin that will support Beaumont Hospital through the winter months. This measure is part of a much larger package of €40 million of additional funding for the HSE aimed at managing winter pressures on the health system by striking a balance between hospital avoidance measures, supporting patient flow through acute hospitals and increasing the availability of social care services. Beaumont Hospital is very important. I accept the point that we need capital investment in emergency services and that there is an issue with the ageing population in local communities. The physical environment of the emergency department is not up to standard, which is something that will be pushed along in the next couple of weeks also.

I sometimes get a little worried when people use the phrase "it is my understanding" and I had hoped for something a little stronger. The Minister of State indicated that Beaumont Hospital was in the process of finalising business cases for these new developments, but it is my understanding the hospital had completed its business case for the emergency department because it was handed to me almost a year ago. It details the €45 million it believes would be required for it. He stated the business cases would be reviewed by the HSE capital and property steering group which approves projects for inclusion in the multi-annual capital plan in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines. The business case has been finalised, but the Minister of State's reply indicates that it will be reviewed by the capital and property steering group and that, as part of the process, funding provision will be made available for the planning and design phases of the proposed new developments in preparation for the capital plan review in 2017. I was hoping there would be a commitment that the capital plan, as outlined by senior management in Beaumont Hospital, of which I have a copy, was being taken seriously and would be delivered. The reply seems to suggest the business plan has not been finalised, but it has been. It also implies that it will be reviewed. The community in the Minister of State's constituency was hoping for something a little stronger. I totally understand there are other issues, including staffing and demographics that are particular to Beaumont Hospital and the wider area. The business case has been produced and I am worried about timelines and the commitment that can be given about the delivery of the physical infrastructure the hospital states it needs. It cannot stand over the service it provides, which I am sure the Minister of State will agree is extremely worrying.

I give him a commitment that we will have movement on this issue and that we will provide timelines.  On the business plan, I have discovered in recent days that they needed a more comprehensive business case than what was referred to by the Senator. That was in order to comply with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines, as set out in the public spending code. I also requested my adviser to meet the Secretary General of the Department of Health in order to set out a work plan to accelerate this process and they met the same day as Beaumont Hospital's submission was received by the Department. The work plan involves the Department, the HSE and Beaumont Hospital prioritising and clarifying the timeframes for the submission, with the appraisal of a business case for approval by the project team and establishing a design team. This work is a priority and, as I stated, I raised the matter this morning with the Department at the ministerial and management advisory committee meeting. I have also contacted the chief executive officer of Beaumont Hospital to outline the next immediate steps to be taken, that the project is a major priority and that it has our full support. I have secured funding for the planning and design phases in preparation for the capital plan review in 2017. I have also contacted the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, both verbally and in writing, to seek funding priority for the project in 2017. The planning and design stage figures are in the region of €3.6 million and the capital plan goes beyond the €20 million mark. I give a commitment that I will not accept any windy statement from any section. I will demand movement on the project because this is a very important local hospital with wonderful staff and we need commitments. I have given a commitment, but we also need timelines. We need to get on and do the job.
#JenniferMurnaneOConnor	unknown-#JenniferMurnaneOConnor-party	unknown-#JenniferMurnaneOConnor-dob	unknown-#JenniferMurnaneOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	9	I will speak about the provision of free legal aid, something which is very close to my heart. There is no such thing as free legal aid, something that should be clarified and addressed. The cost of providing legal aid in dealing with family law matters involving domestic violence, guardian access and maintenance payments is a minimum of €130. There is no free legal aid in dealing with family law matters aside from child care and child abduction issues. Legal aid in dealing with such matters must be applied for and applications can take a number of weeks to be processed, as opposed to criminal law cases in which an accused person can request a service, have it granted and be appointed with a free legal aid solicitor there and then. The cost of legal aid in family law cases started at €30 before increasing to €50. In September 2013 it increased again to €130. It was a significant increase and done without consultation with organisations or consideration of people's ability to pay. The cost of poviding legal aid is prohibitive for women seeking protection in domestic violence cases. That is a crucial point. The Minister for Justice and Equality has been implementing changes to Acts dealing with domestic violence that are to be commended and welcomed.If the women these changes are supposed to help cannot afford to access legal representation, they are rendered useless and will make little or no change in dealing with the serious issue of domestic violence. Where an interim barring order has been granted against an ex-partner, a hearing for a barring order must be heard within eight days. This timeframe does not allow the woman concerned to apply for legal aid, have her application processed, pay her fee by postal order, have her pink certificates sent to her and find a solicitor. This means that she often has to represent herself in court at a barring order hearing. That is unacceptable because she is going up against someone who could have abused her, her children are there and she cannot afford the fee of €130. Legal aid costs can be paid in instalments, but this can result in a woman having to make an extra payment of up to €20. The cost of buying postal orders, stamps, etc. amounts to ten weekly payments of €13. The nearest offices to Carlow are in Kilkenny and Portlaoise. The legal aid boards cannot issue the pink certificates required by solicitors to represent a client until the full payment has been made. Some solicitors will see clients for an initial consultation, but without the pink certificates they cannot be represented in court. The woman can request a waiver or a reduction, but this involves getting a statement of means from a client and providing a letter of support and the process is too long. I am sure the Minister of State has seen the form required to receive free legal aid, one of which I have to hand. Applying for legal aid is almost like applying for a mortgage or local authority housing. It is unfair on the most vulnerable women in our society. There is a perception that there is free legal aid. There is no such thing. Even if a woman applies for the reduction and the waiver which she rarely receives, it is so long in coming that she has to either go back home or cannot afford to get it. She has to go back to the environment she wants to leave. That is crucial. The most vulnerable people in our society are children and women. Will the Minister of State ensure there is free legal aid available? I have recently dealt with many such cases. In Carlow we offer free legal aid to women and on Friday mornings give out food parcels from supermarkets to them. This is an emergency. Women are entitled to free legal aid. When they seek it, they are told that there is a waiting list and that they could be waiting for weeks. That is too long.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	10	On behalf of the Tánaiste, I thank the Senator for raising this very important matter. The provision of civil legal aid is a long-established practice in Ireland with the original scheme for the provision of civil legal aid having been established in December 1979. It is a prerequisite to obtaining legal services from the Legal Aid Board that a person meet the financial eligibility criteria. If people do meet these criteria, the contribution they pay is based on their income and potentially also on their capital.  The contributions regime has always been premised on the basis that a person pays a one-off contribution for legal advice and a further single contribution for legal aid representation in court. The contribution for legal advice is set at a minimum of €30 and a maximum of €150. This could cover a single consultation if that is all that the client requires or it could cover the negotiation and completion of a separation agreement over many months. The legal aid contribution can rise to a maximum of €1,755 based on a person’s income and can be significantly higher if he or she has assets other than the family home. However, it should be noted that there are some caps on the contributions payable. For most family law cases in the District Court, the contribution will be limited to a sum of €417.  It is also important to note that there are, of course, provisions in place which allow a waiver of the contribution in the event that it would cause undue financial hardship, with clear guidelines provided for the interpretation of financial hardship. I will bring the points the Senator raised to the attention of the senior Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. They include a provision that regard should be had to the immediacy of the requirement for legal aid and the nature of the case to which the application relates. For example, if the applicant is seeking a legal aid certificate for the purpose of taking a case on foot of the domestic violence legislation, the guidelines state a sympathetic approach should be taken to an application for a waiver or a reduction in the contribution, particularly if the applicant’s sole income is a social welfare payment. The Senator's point about vulnerable women will have to be made forcefully to the Tánaiste. These are the general arrangements in place. There are also categories of cases where the provision of legal services is free and there are other categories where specific arrangements apply. For example, persons who have been served with proceedings by Tusla will need to meet the financial eligibility criteria, but they are not required to pay a contribution. Services under the new Abhaile scheme are provided free of charge for eligible persons and asylum seekers are charged a €10 contribution fee for services in relation to international protection matters. The Tánaiste is aware that the Legal Aid Board is keen to ensure nobody will be deprived of appropriate legal representation in court proceedings. The board keeps the contributions regime under active review and I anticipate that the new board which the Tánaiste will appoint shortly will also take an active interest in making sure the contributions regime is appropriate and fair. The Tánaiste also knows that the board is working to ensure a consistent message about its guidelines for waiving or reducing contributions will be given to persons who may have difficulty in paying a contribution. It has recently launched a new website, with a view to making more information available online.  Senators will be aware that the Legal Aid Board is also responsible for the provision of the State’s family mediation services. As recently as Monday, the Tánaiste officially opened its first co-located law centre and family mediation office. The family mediation services it provides are free and the Tánaiste very much hopes more people will seek to use mediation to address family problems, although, of course, she realises mediation is not the solution in every case.  While paying a legal aid contribution can be a difficulty, it is important to note that they are one-off payments that most people are unlikely to experience more than once or twice in their lives. As I have indicated, the waiver applies in the most sensitive cases. I will bring the issues the Senator has raised about these important matters to the attention of the Tánaiste.

It is good that the Tánaiste is considering the use of mediation services because that is appropriate. It is just a perception, but people in receipt of social welfare payments or stay-at-home mothers have to receive their entitlements. My biggest concern is that there are many waiver schemes that are not being addressed. I would like the Minister of State to address this issue and give those who are entitled to it free legal aid.

I accept the point that we have to examine applications and that where an applicant is entirely dependent on social welfare payments, we must be very sensitive. I will bring the points made by the Senator to the attention of the Tánaiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and hope we will see progress being made on the issue.

We are disappointed that in recent weeks the schedule has been very light on legislation. I am aware that the Leader is trying to get legislation into the House. I spoke to the leader of the Fianna Fáil group and our spokesperson on justice in the Dáil and we will be pushing for the Corporate Manslaughter Bill to be brought before this House in the next two weeks. I ask the Leader to liaise with the Department of Justice and Equality to arrange for the Minister or the Minister of State to be present to allow the Bill to complete Second Stage in the next two weeks and proceed to Committee Stage.

All it will do is make builders richer. If that is the Government's answer to the problem, it does not know what the question is. Sean Barrett, a former Member of this House and a leading economist, has told me that it is not a solution to the problem, which is lack of supply. We need a better solution than the one put forward. In that regard, Members on this side of the House will be proposing a number of amendments to the Finance Bill. Of equal concern is the child care provision. The issue has been raised by Members on all sides of the House and the provision must work in a better way. In some instances, people will benefit by only 50 cent an hour, which is merely a drop in the ocean. While it is better than a kick in the head, as described by some journalists, it is not good enough. It does not take into account anomalies in the case of babies and toddlers who require to be minded by a childminder. As there are only 160 childminders registered with Tusla, from where will all of the people come if we make it open to childminders? I express a word of caution. There are 30,000 fewer civil servants than in 2008, yet the wage bill next year will be €20 billion, or only €700 million less than in 2008. Have we learned anything in the past few years? Have we reformed the system? We have fewer public servants, but very shortly the wage bill will be the same.

The announcement was not specific in terms of where the money would be allocated. My response is that this is typical. It is a pacifier for the public in that the sum €35 million sounds great, but the amount has not increased at a time when the funding for every other Department has. Every Government gives the same amount of money every year, but it is not allocated to any specific area. For example, the numbers of gardai, nurses and teachers will increase, but nothing has been allocated specifically for mental health services. Will the Leader ask the Department of Finance why there is such vagueness about this matter. Will the Government do what it did last year and remove a chunk of money and allocate it where it wants? I understand the Health Service Executive will come up with a plan in the coming weeks, but the budgetary provision will have been forgotten by then. Is that deliberate to allow for chunks of money to be removed from the mental health budget in the hope no one will notice? No one in the Government will care. Will the Leader invite representatives of the Department of Finance to come the House to allow us to get clear answers on the way the money is being allocated?

Bombs from the aircraft struck the hall four times, killing more than 140 people and wounding over 500. One local health official described the aftermath as a lake of blood. Multiple bomb fragments found at the scene appeared to confirm the use of United States' produced NK-82 guided bombs - 500 pound bombs produced by Raytheon in the United States. The ITV news correspondent Neil Connery visited the site and confirmed the evidence. Saudi Arabia's bombing campaign in Yemen began in March 2015 after Houthi rebels deposed the US and Saudi-backed dictator. Since the war began, Saudi Arabia has intentionally targeted numerous homes, factories, markets, schools and hospitals. Given the larger number of US military Hercules C-130 and C-40 Clipper transport aircraft transiting through Shannon Airport - I saw them myself last Sunday - there is the likelihood that some, or even many, of the munitions being supplied to Saudi Arabia by the United States are passing through Shannon Airport.

In June this year I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade about the number of US mid-air refuelling planes that had passed through Shannon Airport. The Government denied that these planes were engaged in NATO exercises; therefore, it is increasingly likely that they are in the process of being delivered to refuel Saudi warplanes that are bombing Yemen. Ireland is almost certainly assisting the United States and Saudi Arabia to kill thousands of innocent people in Yemen. When I raised the issue last week, the Leader stated:The issue raised by the Senator regarding American troops has been well documented ... The important point is that the airport is the gateway to Europe.With respect to the Leader, that is not the important point. The important point is that we are assisting the United States and Saudi Arabia to commit massive atrocities.

Will the Leader ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, if she has taken into account the motion passed in the Seanad on 5 October which called on the Government neither to agree to sign up to nor to authorise the provisional application of the comprehensive economic and trade agreement between Canada and the European Union or any associated invocation of Article 218.5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, furthermore, to uphold Article 29.5.2° of the Constitution which states, "The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann"? Will the passing of the motion influence her decision on supporting provisional application? As time is of the essence, is it possible to receive a written response from her before next Tuesday? If the Government is to ignore the decision of this House on matters of this level of importance, what exactly is the purpose of the Seanad? We know that the Government is accountable to the Dáil, but democracy and sovereignty should be accountable in this House. Yesterday we discussed and sent to the relevant committee the Seanad Bill to improve the functioning and role of the Chamber in the political system. Could the Government send a worse signal than disregarding the motion passed the other week?
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	30	I am seeking clarity from the Leader and probably the leader of Fianna Fáil in the Seanad also on the budget, in particular, the increases in social welfare payments. There seems to be some mystery about exactly when the increased payments will be made. We hear that it will be in March. I am reminded of the old saying, "We have yet to hear which March." Are they to be paid in the first week or the last week of March? If they are to be paid in the last week of March, it is an additional saving to the Exchequer of €28 million. The cost is €7 million per week. This is the first time I have ever seen a budget presented to the Dáil without real clarity on when the increased social welfare payments are to be made. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection have been challenged on this issue in the media, but they have failed to answer. Fianna Fáil is constantly claiming that it has negotiated all increases and payments. Perhaps the Fianna Fáil representatives might now tell us, through the Leader, exactly when the increased payments will be made. We cannot make head nor tail of the budget. We need to know how much it is going to cost. I thank the Leader for his response after I referred to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015. I was heartened by the way he responded. He said he would ask the Minister to come to the House. I am keen to assist the Leader. Ministers have no choice. Under section 14 of the Act, they are required to come to the House in December. When the Leader is informing Ministers that they must attend the Seanad to account for their actions and those of their Departments in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, will he ask them to afford the House the courtesy of furnishing their statements at least two weeks before they attend to allow for proper engagement? Climate change is the biggest challenge facing the country and the world. Two weeks ago and last week we heard about the impact it had on farming communities. We are facing into a rough winter, with possibly more people's homes being flooded. We need proper engagement in this House on the issue. As a matter of courtesy to the House, Ministers should furnish us with their statements in order that we can properly engage with them. I pay credit to the former Minister of State, Senator Paudie Coffey, who was involved in drafting the Bill. There is a strong role for the House in holding Ministers to account for their actions in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I look forward to Ministers attending the House in December. As a matter of courtesy to it, they should publish their statements at least two weeks in advance to allow for proper engagement.

The motion called on the HSE to make available sufficient funding to ensure all primary schoolchildren would receive a minimum dental service in second and sixth classes and, ideally, in fourth class also. It came as a result of the problem posed by tooth decay in children. Tooth decay is a major oral health problem in most industrialised countries, affecting 60% to 90% of all children. It remains the most common chronic disease in children aged six to 11 years and adolescents aged 12 to 19 years. It is four times more common than asthma among adolescents aged 14 to 17 years. Cavities, even in children who do not yet have permanent teeth, can have serious and lasting complications such as pain, tooth abscesses, tooth loss, broken teeth, chewing problems and serious infections. My party colleague, Dr. Claire O'Driscoll, has said that, realistically, once children start to get teeth they should be seen annually by a dental professional. Given that almost one in three young children drinks sugary and sweetened drinks every day and that 411 million litres of sugary sweetened drinks were sold in Ireland in 2014, it is clear that the need for dental professionals is only going to increase. According to the chief executive of the Irish Dental Association, Mr. Fintan Hourihan, the population of children under the age of 16 years in Ireland has increased by 20% in the past decade to 1.1 million. However, the number of dentists tasked with looking after these young people has fallen by 20% in recent years owing to the recruitment embargo. The result is that a large number of primary schoolchildren are missing out on screening in school and their dental problems are not being identified in the early stages. This can have knock-on effects in emergency cases in later life. As in the case of so many preventable diseases, these problems are a strain on the embattled health service. Irregular access to dental care results in higher use of emergency services. We all know that we need to make smarter use of the health service. We need to use preventive measures. We need to stop the problems before they really start. This is a prime example of where we can do that.

The policy document now covers national ports and harbours and has gone through a number of Ministers. Most recently, the responsible Ministers in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have been Deputies Leo Varadkar, Paschal Donohoe and now Shane Ross. Fundamental changes have been made to national harbour and ports policy. A decision was made to take a number of ports considered to be of regional significance out of the control of the Department which so happens to be the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which is where the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, comes in.The transitional period has not been smooth, with the single exception of Wicklow Port, on which I stand open to correction. I am very familiar with Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company because I was a director for ten years. It is important that the Minister come before the House to explain the status of the roll-out of the national ports policy and, more importantly, his failure to appoint directors to fill vacancies at a number of ports within his remit. I want to give him an opportunity to come and be questioned about the matter rather than read every week in The Sunday Business Post about the 30 or 40 appointments within his brief that have never been made for some peculiar reason or about somebody taking the moral high ground. I want to be given an opportunity to ask him questions in this Chamber. That is very important. I also want to find out about the process of due diligence. There is a very expensive process of due diligence at a number of ports, yet there seems to be no action. Why is it that three Ministers with responsibility for harbours have failed to proceed with the transfer of harbours, which is Government policy? It is really important to have the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, come here early to explain the issues involved. In particular, I want to make reference to Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company which has four vacancies on its board. As the harbour is falling apart, it is really important that the Minister come before the House to outline when he will sign the necessary documentation for the transfer of the port from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.

It is a topic that has been debated for over a decade. The Alf Smiddy report which was published last year recommended a merger and we are now having a review of that report. There is genuine concern that we are reviewing another report. There should be only one local authority in Cork. I will park that view for now and say we need to look again at the process and what we are doing. As the executives and members of the two local authorities have made their views known, it is about time we asked the public its view. We need to hold a plebiscite. The people of Cork city and county have to be asked whether they want to have one local authority. That is the key. Everybody is having a say except the public. It is inappropriate and if we were to have a plebiscite, we would have a decent debate on the topics and issues that affect the people of Cork. We have seen mergers happen in places such as Waterford, Tipperary and Limerick and they have worked to a degree. We need to engage in this debate and get everyone involved. The debate is being run by academics, the executives of the two local authorities and, to a lesser degree, public representatives. The people are being kept out of it. A plebiscite is the only appropriate avenue to have a genuine discussion and I hope come up with a conclusion that can be backed by the people of Cork.

The committee heard from the Irish Deaf Society a fortnight ago. Its presentation, on the back of the very important work of Senator Mark Daly on the issue, had a profound impact on the members of the committee. The relevant Bill is awaiting Second Stage in the Seanad. I hope it will be brought before us sooner rather than later and that all Senators will support it. We have the opportunity, through legislation, to support, encourage and, ultimately, empower deaf citizens. Agus cúrsaí teanga luaite agam, impím arís ar a ngCeannaire go mbeadh seal díospóireachta againn leis an Aire ó thaobh chúrsaí Gaeilge de. Tá díomá agus fearg anois tagtha ar phobal na Gaeilge mar gheall ar an bhfógraíocht a rinneadh le linn an bhuiséid an tseachtain seo. An tseachtain seo caite, bhíomar uilig thall ag an imeacht a bhí ag Conradh na Gaeilge in Óstán Buswells. Chonaic mé roinnt de na grianghraif ón imeacht. Táim ag smaoineamh go ndúramar uilig go ndéanfadh muid ár seacht ndícheall ar son na Gaeilge, ar son phobal na Gaeilge agus ar son phobail na nGaeltachtaí ar fud na tíre. Mar a chonaic muid i bhfógairt an bhuiséid, tá laghdú de 9% anois tagtha ar an mbuiséad do chúrsaí Gaeilge. Is cinnte go mbeidh tionchar thar a bheith diúltach agus gasta ar an bpobal Gaelach mar gheall ar an gciorrú seo atá déanta ag Fianna Fáil agus Fine Gael. Cuireann sé sin béim ar an bhfáth go bhfuil an tAire de dhíth, go mbeadh seal againn na cúrsaí seo a phléigh agus go mbeadh muid in ann impí ar an Aire agus an Rialtas an cinneadh seo a thiontú thart. Tá an díospóireacht de dhíth ionas go mbeimid in ann an tábhacht eacnamaíochta, sóisialta agus cultúrtha a thagann de bharr na Gaeilge a aithint i réimse leathan den saol, chomh maith le na buntáistí a thugann sé dúinn, go háirithe don aos óg ar fud na tíre. Glacaim leis, mar a dúirt sé cheana, go ndéanfaidh an Ceannaire a sheacht ndícheall an tAire a thabhairt isteach. Tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann é sin a dhéanamh chomh luath agus gur féidir.

There is a housing crisis on this island. Approximately 11,000 properties have been taken under the judicial court procedure owing to implementation of the Act. One of the consequences is the fast-tracking of thousands of cases under a thing called the Circuit Court procedure. The Circuit Court sounds fine, but it is the country registrar, not a judge, who decides these issues. Many of the registrars are not really familiar with this area of the law. They are known as the eviction courts.

People are hurting because of this procedure. Cases are being adjudicated on by county registrars, many of whom do not have familiarity with this area of the law and they do not always adhere to Circuit Court rules either. That is the evidence I have been given. In most counties, except Dublin and Cork, the county registrar is also the sheriff. They receive a 7.5% premium in making the judgments. There is, therefore, an obvious conflict of interest. If one stands to gain financially from a decision against a family in a property case, of course, there is a conflict of interest. Therefore, the Act needs to be reviewed. It has been in operation since 2013 and we should now look at it in the light of the case history. All I am asking for is an examination in order that those who take a different view can express it. I have been briefed very strongly on the issue. Anything that can be done to alleviate the position of people who find themselves in these difficulties should be done.

The position is that the deadline will not be extended. A decision has been made that there will be no blanket derogation sought from the European Union. At this juncture, there are farmers in parts of the country who will not make the deadline. There is an exceptional circumstances procedure, whereby if animal welfare is in question, farmers can make a case for a derogation of sorts.Exceptional circumstances include, for example, where animals are about to be housed and a holding tank for slurry is about to overflow, with environmental consequences. In the next few days these farmers need to contact the district veterinary office in their county to make it aware of their situation and make it known that they will not be able to meet the deadline owing to weather conditions and other circumstances. It is very important that farmers move now in order that they will not be in a catch-22 in which they will have a full slurry holding tank, they cannot spread the slurry and have animals they are trying to house. Their animals will be in a desperate situation and there will potentially be other environmental consequences if slurry tanks overflow. It is a very important issue for farmers in particular parts of the country.

Members will know that in the previous Government Fine Gael showed fair contempt for democracy. It attempted to silence this House, which did not work out. The then Minister, Phil Hogan, had more success in silencing democracy at local level by abolishing town councils. Members will know that rural towns are struggling. In my town, Listowel, despite the best efforts of a very go-ahead business community, there are many empty premises for sale and to let and very little inward investment. Town councils were very important assets in towns such as Listowel and the Cathaoirleach's town of Killarney. My party, Fianna Fáil, is committed to restoring them when we return to office. Our spokesman, Deputy Barry Cowen, has a very clear document outlining how we will do it. In the next couple of years of the Government's term, I hope the issue of local government will come to the fore again. I hope there will be all-party support for Fianna Fáil's position on restoring town councils.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	57	In response to Senator David Norris, it is important to highlight the case dealt with by the Court of Appeal. The matter was referred in a case stated in the High Court. The Senator is right that it was in relation to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act. It was decided that such cases could not be brought before the Circuit Court but could be brought before the High Court. One case involved a landlord who owned six properties on which repayments were not being made to the financial institution. If they are not being made to the financial institution, the taxpayer is paying. While I am very concerned when a family home is repossessed, I am not concerned in the same way about cases in which landlords are collecting rents but not making repayments to financial institutions, which is happening.

In my experience of dealing with county registrars, in any case in which the property owner is not consenting, the matter is referred to court for decision, as Senator Michelle Mulherin said. The county registrar does not take the decision. County registrars do not receive a premium of 7.5% when they give a decision. The issue does not arise in the scenario in which they make a decision on such a matter. They are not entitled to a premium of 7.5% if the bank repossesses the property by consent. The figure of 7.5% arises only when the county registrar acts as a sheriff. It is important to clarify the matter. I have produced a detailed reply which I have already given to Senator David Norris. I have replied to the queries raised.

We need to clarify the role of the House in the bringing of new legislation before the House. In the previous Seanad a number of new Bills were introduced and carried forward to the other House. I am concerned that we seem to be on the back foot and that new legislation is not being introduced in this House. I am wondering if that can be changed. We need to expedite a number of Bills and the Seanad would be the appropriate place in which to introduce them. Senator Mark Daly said Fine Gael was getting it wrong on housing. He also said we were getting it wrong on job creation. We have created 160,000 jobs since 2011. He also said we were getting it wrong on the economy. When we took over, expenditure was €20 billion higher than income. The deficit is now less than 1%. I would, therefore, take the Senator's concern about the grant with a grain of salt.

This week and in the weeks ahead many people will receive letters informing them that their loans with Ulster Bank, many of which are in arrears, have been transferred to Cerberus, a by-word for murky deals and money lost to the public purse. Project Eagle is an example of the massive discount given in the utmost secrecy. Many of the loans involve farmers and small businesses which have experienced difficulties during the financial crisis. No figure was released for the discount at which the vulture fund bought the loans and we will probably never know. Once again, we have no idea how much of a haircut the company received. In Britain there was a parliamentary investigation into the sale of Northern Rock and the total was £13 billion. It had failed to pass on reductions in interest rates to its customers. Now that the Government talks about recovery, it is deeply worrying that many people who have attempted to recover are at the mercy of ruthless vulture funds. We need more concrete action to help those in mortgage distress and this can be done. It was up to my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, to introduce a Bill last week to remove the Statute of Limitations in the making of complaints against financial institutions. We, in Sinn Féin, are here to make progress and find solutions, regardless of the Government's inaction. It would be worthwhile if we could have the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State at that Department in the House in the near future to outline the Government's plans to protect mortgage holders from vulture funds.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	71	I join my colleagues in calling for a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the atrocities in Yemen and Syria. Ireland is very well placed as an independent arbiter to try to highlight these very difficult and gut-wrenching horrors. I look forward to having that debate.  We also need to bring the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House. A map of the island shows motorways running to Belfast and Galway, but there is an area between Galway and counties Donegal, Sligo, Roscommon and over to Belfast that has no motorway or dual carriageway. We talk about the A5 and other roads. If we are serious about bringing the country together, we must bring these roads up to dual carriageway or motorway standard. While I can drive from Galway to Dublin in two hours, in coming here from Boyle and Roscommon one has to pass through two or three towns in which there is traffic. Such a development could help us to attract further jobs to the areas mentioned.If one can be within two hours or an hour and a half of a major city, it will make sense. I know that some work has been done, but I do not think the NRA has been at the forefront in treating the issue with the respect and urgency it needs. I would be delighted if the Leader asked the Minister to come to the House to discuss these few outstanding roads issues.
#BrianODomhnaill	unknown-#BrianODomhnaill-party	unknown-#BrianODomhnaill-dob	unknown-#BrianODomhnaill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	72	I support Senator Frank Feighan in his comments on interurban roads. He is dead right. The interurban road network serves most regions of the country well, but the north west is not served at all. There was a plan involving the A5 route, with a commitment from the Governments, North and South, to provide funding for a new 2+1 road network linking Donegal and Derry with Dublin. Of course, that project was shelved in 2011 by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who cut the funding committed by the previous Government from over €400 million to around €50 million, which sum was to be used for design purposes. I am not having a go at the previous Government. All I am saying is there seems to be a lack of commitment on both sides of the Border to the A5 road project. The shift in Northern Ireland appears to be towards the link road from Derry to Belfast rather than the road which runs through Northern Ireland linking Donegal with Dublin. I would really welcome it if the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport came to the House to discuss the issue. The NRA is now known as Transport Infrastructure Ireland. I suppose it would provide the funding needed, but the difficulty is that capital funding has not been made available even in budget 2017 to meet the commitments that are required to be made. There is a need for political will on both sides of the Border to put the issue back on the agenda. I am glad that Senator Frank Feighan raised it because it is an important one. It would be welcome if the Leader brought the Minister here to talk not just about the route mentioned but also other interurban routes and bypasses around major towns. The Ballybofey-Stranorlar bypass and the Macroom bypass in west Cork are example of bypasses that have not been progressed but are at design stage. When will the funding be made available to progress these projects? Perhaps we might have a debate on all of these issues.

I join Senator Mark Daly in wishing our colleague and friend Senator Catherine Ardagh and her future husband every success, joy and happiness tomorrow. I hope the Child of Prague has been put out because rain like we have had this morning certainly would not help. On Tuesday Senator Catherine Ardagh ordered me not to mention it, but as Senator Mark Daly has broken protocol, I believe I should congratulate her on behalf of the House. The Bill on the recognition of Irish Sign Language for the deaf community will be before the House next week. I join Senators Niall Ó Donnghaile and Mark Daly in congratulating the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on the publication of its report today. I hope we will receive the support of the House next week for the Bill.  It is beyond my gift to bring forward the Corporate Manslaughter Bill, but we have asked the Department of Justice and Equality about it.  Senator Mark Daly raised the issue of child care. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, will be in the House next week to discuss it.  On the first-time buyer's grant, I do not want to provoke a fight this morning, but we have come through the worst recession in the history of the State and the supply of housing is at rock bottom. We had a very good debate on the issue in the House yesterday. We must build and supply housing and ensure first-time buyers can access credit to get on the property ladder, something they cannot do. The Government is committed to facilitating the building of houses and providing first-time buyers with a grant. Academics disagree as they will do, but the important point is that we need to incentivise the market. We need people to be able to buy second-hand houses, which is the reason the home renovation scheme is in place, but it is also important that they be able to access credit.  In response to Senator Gabrielle McFadden, I have met the Government Chief Whip to discuss the initiation of legislation. In its legislative programme the Government commits to the publication of 25 Bills this session. It is important that Bills be initiated in this House because in that way there would not be a legislative backlog. Part of the difficulty which some in the commentariat do not understand and about which they do not write is that lots of legislation is subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. That was a very positive departure in the last Dáil and Seanad, but it means that the process has slowed down. However, it makes for a better parliamentary system. As somebody who chaired the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in the last Oireachtas, pre-legislative scrutiny is very important. However, the Senator is right and we all agree that there is a need for more legislation to be initiated in this House. This is something for which we have asked.  Senator Joan Freeman referred to mental health services. It is a very important issue. The important point is that there has been an increase in the Government's commitment to the provision of mental health services which the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Helen McEntee, has been very successful in promoting. An extra €35 million will be allocated this year, in addition to the €35 million provided last year. There is the commitment to the Central Mental Hospital in the capital plan, as well as to the construction of a new forensic mental health service in Portrane.  The important point which we need to put into perspective concerns how the HSE allocates money in its service plan. Therein lies the difficulty in the health service. The Government has allocated €14 billion to the Department of Health, the highest ever spend. It is in excess of the amount allocated when Deputy Micheál Martin ran out of the Department and when former Deputy Mary Harney was stuck in it because no one would take the job. Senator Mark Daly referenced the increase in numbers and wants to see more services being provided, something with which we all agree, but that will cost money. How is it to be allocated? That is the big question we should be asking the HSE. How will it apportion, allocate and spend the money given to it by the Government and the Department? It is a matter to be dealt with in the context of the service plan.  Senator Paul Gavan again referred to Shannon Airport. I can tell him clearly that I am not afraid of anything. Our neutrality has not been compromised or altered.

I might be wrong, but I think Deputy Peadar Tóibín chaired the committee, although it might have been Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn. I cannot remember, but it was one or the other. I will, however, be happy to have a debate on the issue, on which the Senator has engaged in a lot of protestations. Where I join him is in the condemnation of the bombing and killing of people in Yemen. There can be no ambiguity in our expression of not just outrage but also solidarity. There is a need to see a resolution-----

Senator Grace O'Sullivan referred to the CETA. I will be happy to invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, to come to the House to address the points made by the Senator.  Senator Kevin Humphreys referred to social welfare payments and referenced savings of €28 million. I will answer the Senator's question. On the ambiguity about the payment date, the position is very simple. The Government wanted to give a €5 increase to everybody, although some did not want to give an increase to anybody. If one looks at Sinn Féin's alternative budget, one can see that it would give less. I have read Sinn Féin's documentation and it was proposing to give less.

I will be happy to have the relevant Minister come to the House to discuss the matter. It is important that we put pressure on Russia and the United States to find a solution and that we see both powers not scoring political points because people are being killed, while the survivors have nothing to look forward to. Senator David Norris also spoke about the matter. Senator Keith Swanick raised the important issue of tooth decay and the provision of dental treatment for the youth. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has provided €2.5 million to fund the restoration of dental and optical treatment benefits. The Irish Dental Association has been raising the issue for some time. Its fine chief executive officer is Mr. Fintan Hourihan. It was a Fianna Fáil Minister, former Deputy Mary Hanafin, who cut the benefit and it is right to restore it. Potential future problems must be tackled now. I agree with the Senator with whom I will be happy to work on the issue. Senator Victor Boyhan mentioned harbours and ports which are a critical part of our infrastructure. The Port of Cork is a very important gateway to the city and the rest of Munster. Senator Tim Lombard raised the contentious issue of the merger of the two local authorities in Cork. I welcome the appointment by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, of a review group to consider the report mentioned. I am not so sure the Senator is correct in his call for a plebiscite, on which I respectfully disagree with him. Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile referred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the context of Irish Sign Language. Beidh an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Séan Kyne, istigh sa Teach go luath i Mí na Samhna. The Minister has increased the budget for Gaeltacht support schemes by €440,000; there has been an improvement to the tune of €250,000 in the allocation for the Irish language support scheme; an extra €250,000 has been allocated for the 20-year Irish language strategy, while there has been an increase in the budget of An Coimisinéir Teanga. There has also been an increase of €1 million in funding for Údarás na Gaeltachta, while there is €9.275 million to assist the islands and €13.29 million for the agencies within the remit of An Coimisinéir Teanga. Like all Members, the Minister is committed to the promotion of the Irish language. As I have said before, my biggest regret is that, having taken honours Irish in the leaving certificate examinations, I do not have the gift of comhrá, although I do try.

There are several issues linked to it, including animal welfare and the impact on the environment. I hope the relevant Minister will look at granting a derogation. Senator Ned O'Sullivan referred to town and regional councils, of which a review is taking place. He is stretching it a little when he blames the abolition of town councils for the fact that there are idle shops and no factories in many towns. He might look at his party's policies when in government which caused the recession that forced many shops and factories to close. However, I accept his point on the need for a return of some town councils. In the budget there is an allocation to expand national rural development schemes, an additional €8 million for town and village regeneration projects, with the maintenance of the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector. I have already answered Senator Colm Burke on the initiation of Bills in the House. Senator Rose Conway-Walsh raised the issue of Ulster Bank and Cerberus. I will be happy to have the relevant Minister come to the House to discuss it. Senators Frank Feighan and Brian Ó Domhnaill made good points on the issue of transport. It is important that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, come to the House to discuss it. My office has submitted a request in that regard.

I am pleased to be in the House to discuss the consequences for Ireland of the result of the EU-UK referendum. I will begin by giving some details of the comprehensive series of actions my Department and I have taken in response to the UK referendum result. On the day of the referendum result I established a co-ordination group on Brexit in my Department consisting of the chief executive officers of both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, with relevant enterprise, Single Market and trade officials from the Department. The group which I chair continues to meet regularly and oversees the management of our response to the referendum result. I have met a wide range of representative organisations, including IBEC, ICTU, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, the Small Firms Association, the Irish Exporters Association, the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Irish Farmers Association, to provide an update on immediate responses and reassure business in the aftermath of the result. Last month I travelled to Brussels, where I had a series of meetings with the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, Elbieta Biekowska; the European Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmström, and Vicky Ford, MEP, chairperson of the Internal Market Committee of the European Parliament. I used the meetings to convey the unique impact of Brexit on Ireland at the earliest stage, in advance of the commencement of the detailed exit negotiations. On 2 November I will have meetings in London with my two recently appointed UK counterparts, the Secretary of State for International Trade, Mr. Liam Fox, and the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Mr. Greg Clark. Similarly, I will be using these meetings to ensure the importance of the unique circumstances for Ireland is fully understood at Cabinet level in the United Kingdom. I am conscious that a decrease in the value and-or the volume of exports to the United Kingdom will directly affect Irish industry, including SMEs and agrifood sector enterprises. Enterprise Ireland has been systematically engaging with its 1,500 clients which export to the United Kingdom A key element of counteracting Brexit impacts will be to diversify exports to third markets by growing client participation and sales into these markets. Last week during international markets week more than 140 international market advisers from over 30 Enterprise Ireland overseas offices returned home to assist over 400 client companies in developing new global export plans in the context of Brexit. At my request, Enterprise Ireland has extended its schedule of Minister-led trade missions, with 36 missions and events in 2016 and a further 32 other trade events in the second half of 2016. During the next six weeks I will be leading several trade and investment missions to the United States, China and Japan. The United Kingdom is and will remain a key market for Enterprise Ireland clients. The agency will continue to help exporters to deepen and strengthen their presence there by helping them to become as lean and as innovative as possible. Ireland will also continue to make the most effective use of the framework of trade agreements the European Union already has in place, as well as supporting the opening of new markets through the Union. These agreements such as the EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA, which will be signed by EU Ministers in Luxembourg next week and future agreements in progress such as those with the United States, Mexico, South American nations, Vietnam, Singapore and the EU-Japan free trade agreement will all create sizeable new and diversified market access opportunities for Irish exporters. The Budget Statement this week contains many measures which will assist Irish business to become more competitive and cope with the impact of Brexit. They include an extra €52 million to support further job creation, innovation and support Irish companies to respond to the challenges and opportunities arising from Brexit. Importantly, we have secured additional moneys which will provide for an extra 50 staff for my Department and its agencies. The staff will be specifically tasked with assisting companies adjusting to the challenges faced as a result of Brexit, securing new business and innovation opportunities and diversifying into new markets. In addition, the rainy day fund of up to €1 billion per annum from 2019 onwards, announced as part of the budget, can be utilised in the event of a Brexit-related downturn or another global shock. In our collective efforts to address the challenges arising from Brexit, we should not overlook whatever opportunities may emerge for Ireland on account of the United Kingdom's withdrawal. That is why I have directed IDA Ireland to explore the potential for winning more foreign direct investment. This will not be easy. The global foreign direct investment market is extremely competitive and we must fight hard to secure each and every new investment into Ireland. Other countries will also be doing their best to win potential new investments which may arise on account of Brexit. Thankfully, in our efforts to win more foreign direct investment we can continue to rely on the selling points which make investing in Ireland attractive in the first place. The challenge for us is to make sure these messages are communicated to the international business audience. It is for this reason my Department recently made €500,000 available to IDA Ireland to strengthen its communications capacity. As for the implications of Brexit for relationships between North and South, it goes without saying our No. 1 priority is to ensure, no matter what happens, the peace process is protected and safeguarded. This view is shared fully by the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. My particular focus though is on the commercial and trade implications of Brexit for Ireland and the Border region, in particular. Much will depend on the nature of the deal which will be negotiated between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The Government will not be slow during that process to highlight our unique economic ties with Northern Ireland. We will also be doing our utmost to protect the interests of those companies and businesses which engage in cross-Border trade. InterTradeIreland, the cross-Border body tasked with supporting trade and commerce between North and South, will have an important role to play in this area in the time to come. The European Union's programme Horizon 2020 is an important source of funding for research and innovation activities in Ireland.It enables us to amplify the impact of domestic public investment by leveraging complementary funding from the European Union. In addition to funding, Horizon 2020 provides a mechanism for researchers and companies in Ireland to network and collaborate with the best researchers and leading companies across Ireland and Europe. These benefits are particularly important for a small island nation. While the United Kingdom is the largest source of partners for Ireland in Horizon 2020 programmes, it is not by a large margin and we continue to strengthen our relationships with other European countries. It is useful to note that the UK Treasury has given an assurance that it will underwrite the payment of Horizon 2020 awards to all UK organisations for awards made while the United Kingdom is still a member of the European Union, even when projects continue beyond its departure from the Union. The consequences of the UK EU referendum result will have a profound impact on the policy areas of my Department. However, Senators can rest assured that my Department and its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, are working to ensure the most advantageous outcome for Ireland and the European Union with a view to minimising the impact on Irish enterprises, employees and consumers arising from the United Kingdom's departure.

As she has outlined, there are many serious implications, but this is not of Ireland's doing. I will outline some of the things on which we are trying to keep an eye. Our unique relationship with Britain has been built up over years. Safeguarding the work and progress made in the peace process is evidently going to be one of the key points. The prospect of going back to a hard border is a serious concern for everyone involved. All of these issues have to be teased out and we will have to wait to see what will realistically happen in practice. That is the key aspect we have to get around. I am disappointed that the First Minister in the North was not as keen on certain proposals. Perhaps it was not handled as well as it might have been by the Government, although I am not getting political about it. The prospect of an all-Ireland forum to discuss Brexit was suggested as the way forward, but politically it did not work out for whatever reason. It would have been a great help if we had all tried to sing off the same hymn sheet. Perhaps it was never going to be that simple. The common travel area is going to be a matter of concern, into which Brexit is feeding. Our strong trade links with the United Kingdom are vital. We know the figures. In agriculture, 55% of our beef exports are to the United Kingdom, as are 30% of our dairy exports. These are concerning figures. I am curious about two points which the Minister might consider discussing with her Cabinet colleagues. She hit on the point about the money available in the budget from 2019 onwards. I was a little disappointed that there was nothing more forthcoming in the budget to put more money into the system and front-load it and in some way do a little more. Since this is such a serious issue, there is another thing at which we should have looked. Britain has done it and I suppose it had to because it is going to affect the people there directly and it was their decision. We should have appointed a Minister of State or made a position to deal with Brexit. It would have shown how serious and earnest we were. As we know, it is probably going to have the most serious economic impact, apart from cultural and social impact and so on. We will see a new shifting landscape in time to come. We could have appointed a Minister of State to deal with this specifically, if not created a full ministry. These are some points the Minister might take on board.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	118	I again welcome the Minister to the House. I welcome much of what she had to say in her opening statement. Obviously, the prospect of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union is a major risk to Ireland's economic recovery. The Government has taken this seriously. I imagine we will not know the full extent of the risks until the negotiating process is complete. Already, we have seen the impact of falling sterling on our exports. This is a small, open economy and an exporting nation. It is important to restate there will be no immediate change to the free flow of people, goods or services between our islands for quite some time, at least until Article 50 is invoked and for two years thereafter. The bottom line is there will be numerous challenges for us. One is the significant uncertainty in the coming two years while the United Kingdom negotiates its withdrawal. We know that it has the potential, if we are not mindful, to reduce economic growth by 1.2% over two years, which corresponds to a sum of €2.5 billion. Access for Irish goods to the UK market, our largest market, as alluded to by the Minister, will be more difficult than heretofore. Irish goods are likely to be more expensive in the United Kingdom. The Government is cognisant of this and taking measures to help exporters. The possible reintroduction of a hard border is something Senator Aidan Davitt and the Minister have mentioned. These are things we very much have to guard against. As the Minister has pointed out, I do not believe the United Kingdom wants this either. Advantages may come our way too as the only remaining English-speaking nation in the Europand Union. We have a chance to attract businesses and investors who were either investing or planning to invest in Britain but who are now unsure. Ireland has become the sales platform for many goods for other countries outside the European Union. That can now become the case for UK goods also. IDA Ireland has a major opportunity to entice would-be UK companies into Ireland. Many financial services companies, for example, have already signalled their intention to leave London for new European bases. It is in our interest to attract them also. Let us consider the impact already. We have seen one major project in Belfast, a £25 million office block, shelved as a consequence of the Brexit vote. There is extraordinary potential for attracting jobs and investment. We have heard the Minister speak about her plans for further trade missions and diversification into other markets. I welcome this, as, I am sure, does the House. Clearly, there are major challenges for our exporters. Since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, the Government has been proactive in setting out Ireland's concerns, putting plans in place and ensuring our voice is heard at the highest political level throughout Europe. We have heard the Minister state this is a top priority for her and every Minister, Department and agency. The Minister has alluded to the next steps. They will include an all-Ireland civic dialogue on Brexit, with the initial meeting to be hosted by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 2 November. We know that Brexit has the potential to impact on all businesses, but it is up to us to support business to ensure the impact will not be negative. High-level Government meetings have taken place with Michel Barnier, the newly appointed European Commissioner and chief Brexit negotiator. He visited Dublin this week. Ireland has possibly more to lose from Brexit than any other European country. We must ensure our concerns are dealt with at the highest level. As the Minister has pointed out, the United Kingdom accounted for a little under €14 billion of Irish goods exported in 2014 and €20 billion of services exports. In fairness, the Government has introduced measures in the budget which will help to soften the blow of Brexit. It is reducing capital gains tax for entrepreneurs, albeit with the lifetime limit remaining at €1 million. This is something the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has said will be reviewed. This is not Brexit specific, of course, but it is a help nonetheless. The Minister has also extended and amended the foreign earnings deduction to help Irish exporters to diversify export markets.In addition, there was an extension of the contentious special assignee relief programme to help businesses to relocate key staff to Ireland, an increase in the earned income tax credit for self-employed taxpayers to encourage entrepreneurship and the introduction of an income averaging stepout in the agriculture sector because of expected volatility in demand for food products following severe price fluctuations.  It is welcome that the 9% VAT rate to help the tourism industry will remain in place. This is very important because tourism, one of our major industries, is affected by the weak pound. We must do everything we can to continue to encourage the huge number of visitors who come to the country from the United Kingdom.  This is a worrying time for farmers. A €150 million loan fund will be developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to improve cash flow management for them and reduce the cost of short-term borrowings.  Brexit presents a great opportunity for Ireland. Many companies in Britain are considering relocating here and since the result of the referendum the Government has demonstrated that it has a steady hand on the tiller. We are already encouraging these companies to move here and will develop further incentives for them to do so. The fact we are now the only English speaking nation in the European Union is a great advantage. In my constituency of Fingal which is quite near the border we have a wonderful opportunity because of the increased numbers passing through Dublin Airport, access to Dublin port and excellent infrastructure, including motorways. We need to encourage IDA Ireland and the Minister who was in my constituency with officials from IDA Ireland to support us further in making sure we have sufficient advance factories and other supports available for those who considering relocating to the area. It is an excellent area to which to relocate, with a young, diverse and well educated population. The fact that we now have more than 2 million citizens at work, the unemployment rate is under 8%, the economy remains the fastest growing in the European Union and that we are now able to borrow money at a rate of less than 0.5%, whereas before it was 14%, shows that the country has the capacity to deal with this challenge. My appeal is that we make it an opportunity and turn what could be seen as adversity into an advantage. The Government is making preparations to do this. I commend the Minister for the work she is doing in announcing the creation of new jobs, encouraging more firms to relocate here and undertaking more trade missions to new markets to diversify opportunities for business people and citizens.

I want to reflect on it. The most serious consequences of Brexit will be for the Six Counties. It cannot be said it was the decision of the people of the North of Ireland or Scotland to leave the European Union; it was not. The opposite is true. Last Saturday in Bridgend, County Donegal, on the Border with Derry city, I attended a demonstration organised by Border Communities against Brexit. It was one of six protests held at various locations along what had been a hard border and which could evidently be one again if the Tory Party has its way. The protests were organised and attended by members of community, business and sports groups and included attendees from both sections of the community and both sides of the Border. Brexit has united people like never before because it does not make sense. A mock Border post was constructed in Carrickcarnan. It was done in jest, but the reality is that this will be the case unless the Oireachtas stands up for citizens and negotiates to prevent it from happening. Delays at checkpoints, tariffs on trade and passport controls will be standard.  Budget 2017 contains Government measures devised to address issues that will arise from Brexit. They include various tax and economic responses such as reduced capital gains tax, an amendment of the foreign earnings deduction, an extension of special assignee relief, an increase in the earned income tax credit for self-employed persons, income averaging in the agriculture sector and retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism industry. Economics will be a major factor in dealing with the consequences of Brexit once Article 50 is invoked by the Tory Government, about which we are extremely worried. There are many other consequences that will impact on people's lives and the Tory Government is at sixes and sevens. Sterling was in free fall earlier in the week owing to the hard rhetoric being spun at Westminster and by the Prime Minister, Theresa May. Sterling is probably now the most politicised currency in the world which is extremely dangerous for Irish businesses. We do not know what form Brexit will take because the British do not know. It was bravado and chest pumping by right-wing cheerleaders who were full of nationalistic pomp, but they are now picking up the pieces of what was a reckless act. What can we do to pre-empt the consequences of the fallout from Brexit? I note in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready document that we will have a number of arrangements to ensure a whole-of-government response. They will include the establishment of a new Cabinet committee, giving the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade a bigger role and providing for a more focused EU function under a new Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach, integrating international, EU and North of Ireland functions. These are all welcome developments, but the Government is way behind the tide in developing a response. It is welcome that the Taoiseach has confirmed an all-Ireland forum will take place in November, but we need to know immediately when it will take place. In time the DUP, as chief detractor, will be found to be way behind public opinion, as it was when pushing for a "Leave" vote. It took its position, over which it stands, but it was wrong then and it is still wrong. This is the time to move on without it and go with the best interests of communities across the island.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will be crucial in the months and years ahead. There have been trade delegations and there are more to come. I hope they went and will continue to go well and encourage far more in the coming period as we need to support Irish businesses in opening new markets. Like all State agencies, in recent years they suffered staff and resource cuts. There has never been a more important time to fully resource both. This needs to happen now. We need to get back ahead of the tide. Protecting existing jobs is of crucial importance. We have already lost jobs owing to the effects of Brexit on the mushroom industry. At the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine we listened to deeply worrying contributions on the threats posed to that sector. These job losses and the volatility in the sterling exchange rate are only the tip of the iceberg. If direct Government intervention is needed in the form of finance to support these businesses and protect jobs in the short to medium term, we will have to look at providing it.  At the protest last weekend I noted the worries of Irish traders, particularly in the Border area. Traders on this side of the Border are worried about the impact in trading across the Border. I live on the Border and, as a Buncrana man, this has been a real issue. Depending on the currency exchange rate, businesses in my part of the Border region benefit and the benefits rotate towards Derry and Strabane where one will again see the supermarkets packed this Christmas to the disadvantage of businesses in County Donegal.  The sentiment in the United Kingdom that led to the vote in favour of Brexit was one of anger and resentment, particularly in working class areas in England, but they turned their anger the wrong way. This may also happen in America if people vote for Donald Trump, as well as in other elections across the world. Sometimes people who have been failed by the political system turn their anger the wrong way and vote against their own interests. The economic, social and political ideology of the Government which is all too similar to that of the establishment elsewhere in Europe needs to change. Sinn Féin was critical of the European Union when it needed to be in the past and has sought to hold it to account.We have four MEPs seeking to hold the European institutions to account. The system is not perfect. It has let people down. We were left with debts of €64 billion. With every crisis or threat, there is an opportunity. Brexit is an opportunity - not like the one mentioned by former Minister, Senator James Reilly - for people across the island to discuss the reunification of the country and assert that having one economy, currency, taxation system, health system and education system makes eminent sense. Those of us who believe this need to persuade the doubters. We need to win hearts and minds. Last week my party held a public meeting in this city to argue the case for the economic merits of a united Ireland. Our guest speaker was Professor Kurt Hübner, director of the Institute for European Studies at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, and co-author of the recently published and peer-reviewed report Modelling Irish Unification. I urge all Members to read these important findings. The lazy assumptions of too many commentators about the economic impact of a united Ireland on the State are robustly rebutted by this independent study and report. Irish unity makes absolute sense. The crisis and threat caused by Brexit serves to remind us all of this reality once again.
#FrancesBlack	unknown-#FrancesBlack-party	unknown-#FrancesBlack-dob	unknown-#FrancesBlack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	121	I welcome the Minister. This subject is very close to my heart as I have many family members who live in the North. We were all greatly surprised and shocked by the result of the Brexit referendum and are still coming to terms with the possible implications of this decision. Having a hard border between the North and the South would be a huge setback to the progress made since 1998. Brexit poses a major challenge to this country. The economic effect of a hard border and the continuous decline in the value of sterling will have a massive impact on our competitiveness. Let me break up this issue into a few topics, the first being the food and drink sector. An IBEC report states that were sterling to weaken to the 90p mark against the euro, it would result in losses of more than €700 million in food exports and the loss of approximately 7,500 jobs, which is considerable. Exporters need Government assistance to help with these currency losses as the exchange rate is now extremely close to 90p to the euro. Senator James Reilly spoke about tourism. We all know the tourism sector is one of Ireland's most important sectors economically. It has significant potential to play a further role in Ireland's economic renewal. In 2015 tourism was responsible for overseas earnings of €4.2 billion. Tourism also shapes Ireland's image and attractiveness as a place in hwich to live, work and invest. The UK market accounts for approximately 40% of visitors and any weakening of sterling could be devastating for the tourism industry. There were 3.55 million visitors to Ireland from Great Britain in 2015. There probably have been many more this year because of the 2016 centenary celebrations. British visitors accounted for €995 million in direct expenditure during their trips to Ireland in 2015. There are over 205,000 jobs in Ireland's tourism and hospitality sector which supports one in every nine jobs in Ireland. The tourism sector accounts for one in four of all new jobs created in the State in the past five years. There is potential to create more than 40,000 additional jobs by 2021. Tourism accounts for 4% of GNP and generates more than €1.8 billion in taxes annually. Some of the lowest paid people are working in the hospitality sector and the prospect of a decline in this industry should not be used to decrease their wages again. Farming is one of the topics in which I am interested because all my family in the North are farmers. Negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom surrounding the latter's decision to leave the Union must take into consideration the links between the farming industries on both sides of the Border. In a statement made after a meeting between the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Ulster Farmers Union, the IFA deputy president, Mr. Richard Kennedy, said maintaining a strong trading relationship between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland was of critical importance to the economy. The Common Agricultural Policy accounts for over 80% of farm income in the North. Following the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, this money will no longer be available and it is not at all certain that the UK Government will replace this funding. This would lead to a crisis in the agriculture sector. The people living in Border regions will feel the impact of Brexit most. It would be unthinkable to have one part of this island operating within the European Union and another outside it, but that is exactly what the British Government is proposing. It is vital that the wishes of the people in the North, the majority of whom voted to remain in the European Union, be taken into consideration in further negotiations. It is possible that Brexit goes against the Good Friday Agreement. My concern is that the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the people on this island will be ignored.  Another concern I have is about the status of Irish people living in the United Kingdom after Brexit. According to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the right of Irish people to live and work in Britain should not be affected by Brexit. He told a House of Lords select committee that the British Government stood fully behind its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement, including in regard to the right of people born in Northern Ireland to be citizens of the United Kingdom or Ireland and to be treated equally in both jurisdictions. The committee also heard from Mr. Robin Walker, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union, who said maintaining a soft border on the island of Ireland would be a red line in the United Kingdom's Brexit negotiations with the European Union. Even with these statements, can we be sure this will be the case? Has the Irish Government received any indication or assurance from the European Union about the post-Brexit status of the many Irish living in the United Kingdom? The possible fallout from Brexit for the Irish economy is very worrying, as the progress that has been achieved in the past few years through the sacrifices made and still being made by the people may suffer a real setback with any increase in unemployment in the food and drink, agrifood and tourism industries. These issues need to be addressed. A plan must be made to ensure the negative effects of Brexit will be kept to a minimum.

Clearly, a considerable amount of preparatory work has already been done at the front and devoted to this multifaceted challenge. I was invited to the House of Commons last May by those involved in the Irish for Europe campaign. Those concerned were trying to obtain support among the Irish in the United Kingdom for the cause of remaining in the European Union. I said to them the United Kingdom did not have a history of referendums and that the Republic had a clear history, with 27 referendums effectively within 27 years. Unfortunately, the electorate sometimes votes in a referendum on a question that is different from the one put to it. It may not like the government and may have other issues. While it is water under the bridge, the referendum absolutely was the wrong mechanism to use. We are in a very dangerous position. I was reminded that a number of supports and measures were announced in the budget this week for those affected. Senator Padraig Mac Lochlainn is correct in that mushroom growers are already going to the wall. Sandwich makers in Enniskillen are not able to compete. There is considerable uncertainty over the value of sterling. Today we hear about the Marmite emergency. One individual said that while the United Kingdom could do with immigrants being deported, there was a Marmite emergency that had to stop. This is only the start of it. All of the ingredients of Marmite are sourced in the United Kingdom. Seemingly, Unilever wanted to put up the price and now one cannot get Marmite in Tesco stores. I am alarmed that this is the first time people are beginning to take the matter seriously. Effectively, we are sleepwalking our way into a very dangerous situation. This farce of a Marmite emergency is drawing attention to the matter. It just tells us that we are in a very dangerous zone. We need all governments and the European Union to try to retrace our steps out of this crisis. I welcome the many supports provided for farmers, all of whom are worried about the implications of Brexit. The farming and agricultural community is going through a very challenging time, with lower prices internationally and adverse weather conditions. We simply do not know at this stage what will be the terms and conditions of Britain's departure from the European Union. However, as the Minister for Finance noted in his Budget Statement, we do know that Brexit has increased the risks to the economy. There really are no winners out of this for the country, notwithstanding the opportunities that may present. Having said that, we must be to the forefront in seeking to avail of such opportunities. For example, the European Medicines Agency which provides 900 top quality jobs has indicated that it intends to move from its Canary Wharf location. I hope these jobs will come to Ireland, specifically, to my constituency in the north west. I am encouraged that many companies might look to the Republic of Ireland or the island of Ireland as a bridgehead to Europe. However, we must work hard if we are to realise any advantage in that regard. On the question of a broader debate involving the public and interest groups, I am looking forward to the all-Ireland civic dialogue on Brexit which is due to take place next month. It will give us an opportunity to discuss the key areas of concern such as the economy and trade, the common travel area, the Border and the future of EU peace process funding. We have been guilty of treating our relationship with Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom very casually, including the €1 billion of goods traded between the two countries every week and the hundreds of thousands of jobs supported by that trade. Following the Queen's visit to Ireland in 2011, we set up the first British Irish Chamber of Commerce. That ease of trade was something we took for granted. Now we are in a situation where we must review all aspects of our relationship with Northern Ireland and the relationship of this island with Britain, the rest of Europe and the world. Everything should be on the table to ensure we work together effectively to lessen the severity of the impact of Brexit as much as possible. I thank the Minister for the work she is doing. I also thank my colleagues across the floor for coming up with proposals and solutions. We have a long journey ahead and must work together to lessen the impact of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union.

I commend the Government's action before the referendum in doing as much as it possibly could to speak to the Irish community in Britain and all British voters about the importance of this issue for Irish people. However, no message should go out from this or any chamber which does not state clearly that Brexit is an absolute, complete and unmitigated disaster. When the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, came to the House, I talked about the importance of European connectivity, noted that the European Union had in general been a force for good, born out of the ashes of the Second World War and that we had to re-evaluate the European project. The United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, at the behest of the people of England and Wales, is a disaster for Ireland and the Union. As Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn rightly noted, it was narrow-minded nationalism and the whims of a small group which took over the mindset and mainstream of British politics and led to this disaster. That mindset is being replicated, unfortunately, across the world. The regional development committee, of which I am a member, recently received a delegation from Blacklion, County Cavan. I was interested to hear about Senator Frances Black's connections with that area, particularly as mother is from Blacklion and my grandfather was an IRA volunteer in the Civil War. He was imprisoned, went on hunger strike and escaped before spending the rest of his life as a customs officer on the Border, which was an ironic change of career. My mother recalls there being a time zone difference between the North and the South during the Second World War. The delegates from Blacklion told us that Brexit had already had a devastating impact on their community. People who were envisaging buying homes in Cavan and working in Enniskillen are pulling out left right and centre, with their plans for their future and raising their families in disarray. In recent years, because we have come to a collective complacency around peace in Europe and peace on this island, we never envisaged that this would happen. A case before the High Court in Belfast, which Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile has mentioned in the House, involves a challenge by all but one of the major political parties in the North to the constitutional validity of what the British Government has done. Their argument is that it requires a vote of Parliament in order for Brexit to proceed and that no such vote has taken place. I am interested in hearing the Minister's view on that case. I welcome the Government's announcement that an all-party forum will take place at the beginning of next month. We in this House are national politicians and must think of the country as a whole. The Border region will be particularly affected by this issue. In our negotiations and discussions about what happens next, we must be mindful of that impact. The message needs to go out from the Government to all of our European partners that this no small deal. If any other EU member state has sympathy with what Britain has done or feels there might be some political advantage in going down that road, we must say to it that this has been an unmitigated disaster. We cannot say there are advantages in it for Ireland. The message from this country must be that this was a right-wing conspiracy which has gone belly-up and will cause untold misery economically and socially across the Continent. Any dilution of that message would be a major mistake for the Government to make. Senator Frances Black has brought a section of the Minister's speech to my attention. A motion was passed in this House last week, drafted by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, concerning the EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA. The Minister stated:Ireland will also continue to make the most effective use of the framework of trade agreements the European Union already has in place, as well as supporting the opening of new markets through the Union. These agreements such as the EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA, which will be signed by EU Ministers in Luxembourg next week ...Is the Minister mindful that this House rejected that particular agreement, by way of Senator Alice-Mary Higgins's motion, and will she respond to this? Is it something she will take into consideration? I am not sure whether there has been a vote on the matter in the Lower House, but this House had a robust debate on it and most Members rejected the idea of this deal. I ask the Minister to ensure the Government will place a particular focus on Border regions in considering the impact of Brexit, is mindful of not being complacent about the peace process, North and South, and is an absolutely unwavering advocate for the European project. Minsters must speak in stark and forthright terms about how damaging this whole event has been in order to ward off other member states from going down the same road. I ask the Minister to respond to the expressed will of this House on the particular trade agreement to which she referred. I wish her well in her endeavours, but I reiterate that there should be no message from this House or Ministers which dilutes the reality that Brexit is an unmitigated political, economic and social disaster.

I am greatly enthused that the suggestion made by Senators from all sides of the House following the outcome of Brexit vote to have a series of debates with the relevant Ministers has been arranged by the Leader of the House. We have had a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, this week. That is extremely welcome as we dissect the impact of Brexit and try to plan for the next few years while Article 50 is being invoked. I was greatly enthused by the Minister's address which I followed on the monitor upstairs. I welcome many of her comments and her commitment to her Department. It is vital that Ireland take an aggressive step to counter Brexit and make sure everyone knows that we are open for business, that we are up for trading with all nations, including Canada, and that we will continue along this path to make sure Ireland will make the most of what is an absolute and unmitigated disaster. In that respect, I fully agree with Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin. Brexit presents Ireland with many challenges, but it also presents us with a few small opportunities of which we can definitely make the most. However, we need to be proactive and work on them now. Last week in the House I raised with the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, the case for bringing the European Medicines Agency from London to Ireland, preferably to Dublin. The Department of Health is chasing hard to achieve that objective. That is the attitude we need to take. The financial services sector is another area where there is a good opportunity for us to create additional enterprise and employment. This sector already accounts for 8% of GDP and 30% of the jobs in the sector, many of which are back office jobs, are located outside Dublin. County Kerry is a particular hub and I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, was there with Deputy Brendan Griffin last week. I appreciate that her Department, together with Deputy Charles Flanagan's Department, are constantly putting the competitive case for Ireland as being a viable alternative for financial services companies and institutions seeking to relocate from London. Dublin is especially on the platform against rivals such as Luxembourg, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, but there are one or two other obstacles. I have already referred to the delay in processing banking licences. It takes twice as long to get a banking licence to operate in Ireland as it does in Luxembourg which takes a little less time than Paris. When companies want to move their jobs, that is one of the issues that comes up. Another issue that arises is that of accommodation. I read quite a number of public and private reports from financial institutions, media groups such as Bloomberg and Politico and some of the big financial houses here and in London and they state there are two great obstacles in moving to Ireland but more specifically to Dublin. We want to see as many jobs moving across the island, but when it comes to financial services, for front end jobs, Dublin is a key location. We already have the International Financial Services Centre. It is not the be all and end all, but Dublin is our international comparative city. The issue that keeps coming up is the availability of accommodation, both residential and commercial. In terms of residential accommodation, I have full faith in the action plan for housing launched by the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, for which I commend the Government. I hope what it proposes will come to pass. However, we are not paying enough attention to the provision of office space and I call on the Minister to examine that area.  A great report was published during the week by Savills which highlighted that 35 projects were under way in terms of building large-scale commercial developments in the city, but of these 35 developments, 60% are already let. When we have companies seeking to relocate, probably within two to two and half years time, they need to know that they will be able to move full-scale jobs to Dublin, the 900 jobs about which Senator James Reilly spoke and the big companies such as BNP Paribas and HSBC. That is what we want to attract. We need to get the message out that we are on top of that issue. I would like the Government to follow up the action plan for housing with an action plan for office space. It is not glamorous. It is something I said earlier and I was mocked for mentioning it because I am not very good at coming up with catchy titles. It would be very worthwhile.  We can continue to suggest Brexit is a disaster, but the major challenge it poses presents some small opportunities that we will be required to take in order to offset the disaster that is Brexit and the obvious decline that we will see across the country. I wish the Minister well in her endeavours. I know that she is travelling next week to sell Ireland on the international stage. We are great at that as a nation. People say Irish pubs are the best small embassies in the world, but this and the previous Government during the past six years have done much to repair the image of Ireland which was in the gutter in recent years. I commend the Minister for her work and wish her the best. I hope she will be able to take on board the need to tackle the problem of commercial vacancies, particularly in Dublin. Let us use it to our advantage and bring as many financial services jobs to Dublin as possible.

Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as a cur i láthair. Tá mé buartha gur chaill mé é. I am sorry I missed the Minister's contribution in the Chamber, but I read through it subsequently. I will avoid going into the broader politics of Brexit with the Minister because we have debated the issue at length and some may even accuse us of debating it ad nauseam in the past few weeks. It is something I raised consistently before the Brexit vote. I am getting to the point now where we need to get beyond the long-fingering and the benign bland statements, "We do not know; we are preparing; we are talking." I am not advocating a haphazard, knee-jerk or reactive approach, but the negative implications of Brexit are happening. They are happening today; they were happening yesterday, last week and last month and there is much worse ahead of us. I am not the only one who has that view. Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and one of his famous lyrics is: "You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows." The wind is blowing very much against our favour in that regard and it is blowing very coldly and, unfortunately, very loudly from a Tory Administration in London which does not give two damns about the welfare of anywhere beyond the south east of England, let alone the north east of Ireland. I use the opportunity with the Minister present not to grandstand on the political implications of Brexit but to draw from the response at the weekend rallies along the Border which were very well attended. I took great heart from the fact that they were very broadly attended. There were people there from every community. There were people there from a broad range of political parties. People spoke from the platform at the rally I attended on the Louth-Armagh border, people from the trade union movement, the community and voluntary sector, the agriculture sector and the chambers of commerce, North and South. There were a number of tweets during the course of that rally and I want to refer to a few of them. They included the following: £4.4 billion of business is done by businesses in the South with businesses in Britain; 60% of produce sold from the North is sold to EU member states; and 30% of milk produced in the North is processed in the South. There were also the following questions: has England not learned that imposing an English solution on an Irish situation is doomed to failure? Does Nigel Farage represent us? They also included the following comment and question: 40% of farmers' produce in the South goes to Britain and what will added tariffs do to working farming families? Other tweets included the following: EU peace funding helps some of the most marginalised in our society into employment, improves connectivity and assists carers; I do not think we are going to get a replacement of those funds from the British Chancellor; and the scary thing in all of this is the British never planned for this, they are flying blind and that is very dangerous. The following is a tweet from the representative of Dundalk Chamber of Commerce: we do not want to see Newry boom and bust, we do not want to see Dundalk boom and bust, we want to see both of them grow and proposer together, this is going to put small businesses along the Border out of business, it is as simple as that. Brexit is four square, a head-on challenge to our future well-being. With the Good Friday Agreement, the British and the Unionists have constitutionally recognised that the North is not like Norfolk or Devon. Brexit will be a crisis that risks reversing all of the progress we have made here. As everyone knows, regardless of the common travel area in the past, the Border was hard; what broke it was joint membership of the European Union and the advance of the peace process. How do the proponents of Brexit think it will help employment regeneration and welfare in this region? Anyone concerned about the future economic welfare of the island should be worried.  One comment that struck me was about the contribution of one business leader who had highlighted the hypocrisy of Brexiteers when they told us there would be no return to the Border of the past when the whole raison d'être of their Brexit campaign was about borders. It is exactly what they have done. I will finish on the following point.The community along the Border has been quiet on this issue for too long, but that is the end of it. We now have a mobilised, organised, energised and, above all, concerned broad range of society interests, North and South, who are making it very clear that the economic and social implications are massive and tangible and - this brings me back to my original point - that they are live and ongoing. Many messages have been advocated on the floor of this Chamber and rightfully should go from this Chamber. Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn made clear the benefits of exploring the Kurt Hübner report on Irish unification. The Minister mentioned other issues about InterTradeIreland. I ask her to expand on the role she envisages for it as opposed to just saying it will have an important role to play, which goes without saying. The most important message is that a majority of the people in the North, 56%, voted to remain. That should be our stance and that of the Government.

I have taken note of each of them. The debate has provided a helpful opportunity for further engagement on a matter of key importance for Ireland and the European Union. The issues raised will help to inform my Department's policy deliberations in this sphere as we move towards the detailed negotiations that lie ahead. A number of Senators have rightly mentioned the impact of Brexit at regional level. Of course, Brexit remains a key challenge across all regions and especially, as the previous speaker mentioned, along the Border. While the full impact of Brexit is still uncertain, businesses throughout the country with significant exposure to the UK market, for example, in the agrifood sector, are already feeling the effects of the weak sterling. In addition, companies that had been considering scaling up their operations have put plans on hold because of the uncertainty. The implications of the Brexit vote and the challenges and opportunities the decision poses for the regions have been discussed at meetings of the implementation committees for the regional action plan for jobs that have taken place since the decision in June. I have attended these meetings. The regional action plans which build on the template of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs seek to build on local strengths and deliver jobs across every region in partnership with the enterprise sector. Senators will be aware that in regard to Brexit, the priority areas for the Government remain unchanged. In all negotiations the Government will seek to ensure the best possible outcomes will be achieved for citizens, the economy, Northern Ireland and the common travel area. I will ensure my Department will play its part in that regard. We will seek to preserve our existing full market access to the United Kingdom in the framework of any future trade deal between the European Union and the United Kingdom and in line with the Government's position that access to the Single Market must be on the basis of full acceptance of all four freedoms - goods, services, capital and people - which is in accordance with the stated position of the European Union. As I outlined, I expect to meet my two UK counterparts, the Secretary of State for International Trade, Mr. Liam Fox, and the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Mr. Greg Clark, in London shortly where I will discuss issues of common interest in the areas of the Single Market and trade. I will also use the meetings to convey the Government's objective of ensuring the best possible outcome for all parties in the UK exit process. Separately, I have had valuable meetings at the European Commission and the European Parliament, conveying the unique impact of Brexit on Ireland to the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, the Commissioner for Trade and the chairperson of the Internal Market Committee of the European Parliament. In addition, senior officials from my Department have ongoing engagement with their UK trade and Single Market counterparts in London to monitor relevant EU-related issues relevant to my Department. Following the recent announcement by the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, of the March date for triggering the Article 50 process, it is essential for Ireland and the European Union that the transition process now move forward in the most pragmatic manner. In that regard, the Government, including my Department, is continuing to intensify preparations and develop risk analysis and contingency plans. Of course, Senators will appreciate that detailed contingency planning is challenging, given the lack of certainty about what new trading and other arrangements may be put in place between the European Union and the United Kingdom. As part of these preparations, I will continue to lead the co-ordination of the ongoing response, both of my Department and the enterprise agencies, to challenges as they emerge. I will continue to maintain open communication channels with colleagues at EU and UK level in order to ensure the best possible outcomes. I again assure Members of this House that the Government, my Department and the enterprise agencies are fully committed to supporting business and all of our stakeholders in this period of heightened uncertainty. I was asked about the CETA. Its provisional application has been approved by way of a Government decision. Therefore, approval of the agreement by both Houses is not required at this stage. The approval of the Dáil and the Seanad will, however, be required for its final ratification. I was asked about InterTradeIreland. It is one of the North-South bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement. It has a targeted portfolio of programmes to assist businesses, especially SMEs, including to stimulate cross-Border trade. In the first part of 2016 it had an impact on job creation in the employment of 739 people, while 1,512 companies were engaged in cross-Border business through Enterprise Ireland's programme. I have met representatives of InterTradeIreland in this context when discussing the action plan for jobs for the Border region.

At this stage it is important to have a cross-government response and that is what is happening. There is a Cabinet committee which is led by the Taoiseach. A Secretary General has been appointed to look after Brexit matters. Obviously, I will deal with the job creation and enterprise aspects, while the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will deal with foreign policy. We all report to the Cabinet. Since the result of the referendum, Brexit has been on the agenda for nearly every Cabinet meeting.
