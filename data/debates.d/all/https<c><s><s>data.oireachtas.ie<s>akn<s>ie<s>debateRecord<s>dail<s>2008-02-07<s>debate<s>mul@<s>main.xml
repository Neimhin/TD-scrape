I ask also that the Minister for Health and Children give a commitment to retain the accident and emergency services at this hospital into the future as it provides a service for 20,000 patients annually and is the only Limerick city centre based accident and emergency service since the closure of Barringtons Hospital in 1988.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_19">While I have been giving out about his boss, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cullen, today on having the reins of power in the House of Parliament.  We all know the country is in safe hands.  As a former Minister for Transport, will he give the House an update on the position in so far as the roll-out of speed cameras is concerned under the appropriate legislation?  I understand that the chairman of the national Road Safety Authority is most upset about this.  He accepted that job on the basis that the Government would provide the money and would deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">In respect of his Department, the social welfare lone parent and other low income families reform Bill is necessary legislation.  As there is no publication date will the Minister indicate when it might emerge into the light?  In his capacity as Minister for Social and Family Affairs and knowing that payments are important to people, the national rehabilitation board was dissolved in 2000 by the Minister for Health and Children.  The persons employed there under the local government superannuation scheme paid into a fund from which they were entitled to draw entitlements.  Those entitlements were denied them.  One member of staff brought the matter to the High Court and the determination was that his position was abolished and a redundancy was caused.  Approximately 200 others are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">This has been on the stocks for the past seven or eight years.  It is a matter of principle and of political morality in that people are entitled to draw from the superannuation fund into which they paid.  In his capacity as head of Government in the House today, will the Minister, Deputy Cullen, ensure this is examined?  Despite employment inquiries and a High Court decision, only one member of the former staff has received his due entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">As the Minister is aware, the board was abolished by the Minister for Health and Children, having been set up by that Minister.  Nobody will accept responsibility for this mess.  The Minister knows that people are entitled to draw from funds into which they pay, in this case the local government superannuation fund.  Perhaps through his good offices and in his capacity as Minister for Social and Family Affairs, he will ensure that this matter, which has been raised by Deputy Doyle and others, is followed through so these people get the entitlements which they are due.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">In November 2006, the Minister, as the then Minister for Transport, made a very fine speech in which he announced the setting up of the Dublin transportation authority.  He stated he was consulting a couple of people and bodies and that the Bill would be ready before Christmas 2006, but Christmas 2007 has come and gone.  What has happened to the Dublin transportation authority Bill?  Is the Minister aware that because of the works on the M50, all the roundabouts into Dublin from areas such as Lucan, Blanchardstown, Finglas and Ballymun are increasingly gridlocked?  This means the buses from all these huge areas, where CIE caters for tens of thousands of commuters every day, are completely gridlocked.  Has the Minister any influence on when the Dublin transportation authority Bill will be published?</p>
          <p eId="para_39">There is commuter misery.  As the Minister knows, the M50 is a disaster — it is a paying car park that one parks on for a couple of hours a day.</p>

The worker had almost no time off and had no terms and conditions of employment.  The employment law compliance Bill on the Government's priority list is meant to establish a new statutory national employment rights authority, the associated board and related matters.  I hope the Minister knows it is of serious concern to the trade unions in social partnership and to workers throughout the country that this case is just the tip of the iceberg in regard to the exploitation of migrant workers.  When will the Government produce this Bill and the other legislation it has promised?  If it is not produced, the whole structure of social partnership may well be endangered.</p>

It would appear that the ratification process is not progressing.  Previous answers have suggested that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as the lead Department, is reviewing the situation.  The countries that have ratified the convention held a conference recently in which Ireland was not free to participate and could only stay on the margins.  A commitment to ratify the convention is contained in the Government's White Paper on development.  The Government should make a clear statement as to whether it will ratify the convention in the lifetime of this Dáil.   It has been asked to do so by all the NGOs involved in the development area, yet it seems that no progress is being made in this respect.  Until the ratification process takes place, Ireland will be excluded from the debate on corruption and overseas aid projects in which Ireland regularly seeks to intervene.</p>

In fact, two Bills are involved.  The Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill, which completed Committee Stage in the Dáil on 21 January, will enact certain of these necessary measures.  The remaining requirements will be dealt with in the prevention of corruption (amendment) Bill, which is at an advanced stage of preparation.

There is complete confusion over whether further investment will be made in these stations.  When will the maritime safety Bill be enacted?

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_111">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_120">I once again condemn unreservedly the killing of Paul Quinn.  This brutal assault, resulting in the death of a young man, has been properly condemned by all right-thinking people on both sides of the border.  The obvious planned nature of the assault makes it all the more reprehensible.  Deputies of all political parties and politicians across the island share my revulsion at what happened to Paul Quinn and his family.  Let me express again my deepest sympathy to them.  I fully support them in their quest to see those who perpetrated this savage act brought to justice.  It is very sad that we, as Members of Dáil Éireann, find ourselves discussing again a life cut tragically short.  In this case, Paul Quinn was only 21 years old when he was killed on 20 October last year.  I am somewhat constrained, as Deputies will appreciate, in what I can say on this matter.  An investigation into this appalling crime is ongoing in two jurisdictions.  Nothing I or anyone else in the House says, therefore, should interfere with that process.  I have a particular responsibility as Minister in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">The basic facts surrounding Paul Quinn's death will be known to most Members but I will summarise them.  Paul Quinn was lured into travelling across the Border from his home in Cullyhanna, County Armagh, to a cattle shed near Castleblayney, County Monaghan.  He was then set upon by up to a dozen individuals who violently beat him.  There has been speculation that the intention behind this vicious assault was not to kill but to teach a lesson but this is irrelevant.  The outcome could very well have been predicted in the circumstances.  The Garda Síochána was made aware of the incident at 6.10 p.m. on Saturday, 20 October.  Gardaí arrived at the scene at 6.20 p.m. and found Paul Quinn badly injured.  Basic first aid was administered at the scene and he was transferred by ambulance to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  He was found to have serious injuries to the head, lower body and legs.  Despite the best efforts of the medical staff in Drogheda, he died later that evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">I met the family of Paul Quinn before Christmas, as did my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Taoiseach also took the opportunity to speak with Paul's mother and father on the occasion of their visit.  While deeply grieving the loss of their son, they also have a burning desire to see justice done in this case.  As I have said, this is something we all share.  I took the opportunity at that meeting to assure Mr. and Mrs. Quinn that the Garda is absolutely determined to do everything in its power to bring Paul's killers to justice.  The force is carrying out a very intensive investigation with the closest co-operation of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  Many statements have been taken, facts checked and re-checked and forensic and other analyses have been carried out.  This investigation is complex but it is very much live and ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">While some of the individuals involved in the assault on Paul Quinn may have crossed the Border to commit this crime, the Garda and PSNI are demonstrating that the Border will not prove a barrier to their investigations.  In addition to on the ground co-operation, which has included Garda officers accompanying PSNI colleagues to interview individuals in the North, senior Garda management are in close contact with their counterparts in the PSNI.  When the PSNI Chief Constable was in Dublin last week the case was reviewed in his discussions with the Garda Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">I have also spoken to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on several occasions and we are determined to ensure the highest level of practical co-operation in both jurisdictions.  There has been an amount of speculation that there may have been a paramilitary element to this killing, specifically, Provisional IRA involvement.  The investigation by the Garda will lead wherever it may, but the position in this regard remains that the force has no information to suggest this attack was authorised by, or carried out on behalf of, that organisation.  The Secretary of State and myself are in complete agreement that the most important aspect of this crime is that those responsible, whatever their background, are brought to justice, and the way to achieve this is to allow the police investigation to take its course.  It serves no one, least of all Paul Quinn and his family, to politicise his death while active investigations to apprehend his killers continue.  None of us must lose sight of the central fact —  the murder of a young man and the brutal removal of an innocent life by persons to whom humanity and decency are obvious strangers.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">There has been speculation of intimidation of witnesses or potential witnesses in this case.  It would not be helpful to comment on this.  If that has happened or is happening, I condemn it and I am sure all Members will join in that condemnation.  A successful police force needs the trust and co-operation of those to whom it provides its services.  Crucial, therefore, to the success of the Garda investigation will be the level of co-operation which local people are willing to offer.  I would like again to ask people who have any knowledge of this crime to share it with the police.  It is vitally important that people with information that might help find the people responsible and bring them to justice make it known.  I include those who may not have been directly involved but, nonetheless, are party to what could be vital information.  I urge them to examine their consciences and to ask themselves whether they can stand by while young men are beaten to death.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">I thank those who have come forward.  Substantial co-operation with this investigation has been provided by people on both sides of the Border.  Local people are making clear, in ever increasing numbers, their demand for proper, effective policing.  One of the more sinister allegations that has been made about this incident is that it was intended as a punishment beating by those who seek to exert some form of control over the area.  Both Governments, the police forces and people generally are united in determined opposition to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">There is a new optimism in Ireland.  The vast majority of people, North and South, are eager to grasp the opportunity for peace, reconciliation and prosperity with which we have been presented by the peace process.  Many of my Cabinet colleagues are in Dundalk attending a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, discussing further ways to bring benefits through practical co-operation for all the people who share this island.  The past year has shown what can be achieved when different strands of opinion pull together for the common good.  This is the future for the island and we will not allow it to be sabotaged by those who believe the law does not apply to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">I again extend my sympathy to the Quinn family for their loss and appeal to those who have knowledge of this crime to share it with the Garda Síochána or the PSNI.  The two police forces will continue to pursue those responsible with the utmost vigour and in doing so have the full support of the Government and, I am sure, everyone in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">I thank the Government for making time available for statements on the murder of Paul Quinn.  I pay tribute to the Christian courage shown by Stephen and Briege Quinn since the loss of their son.  I recently met Mr. and Mrs. Quinn in Castleblayney.  Briege Quinn was the first person to say there should be no retaliation for the loss of her son because her wish was to see justice for everybody.  I admire her courage in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">The murder of Robert McCartney in Belfast was a spontaneous eruption of violence inside and outside a public house after an incident but the murder of Paul Quinn was an act of premeditated and organised savagery in which a young man was beaten to death.  In many localities in south Armagh and across a wide belt in the region, certain people demand respect and recognition.  They know who was involved in this murder and who gave the instructions and ordered that people were to be on watch when the late Paul Quinn arrived in the farmyard in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">This is a litmus test for the peace process.  We cannot have a situation whereby people are afraid to whisper or speak out because the peace process might unravel.  A peace process cannot continue if it delivers bad justice.  If a just society cannot connect to a peace process through communities, that process will not stand the test of time.  A just society does not exist in this instance.  It is wrong that people with a conscience fear the structures may intimidate or bully them if they speak out.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The late Paul Quinn was entitled to have his good name and integrity protected by the peace process.  I regret the quick response from the Government suggesting that criminal elements may have been involved.  As I told Stephen and Briege Quinn, I and the party that I lead never regarded the late Paul Quinn as a criminal.  It is important that all parties make that statement so as to bring some consolation to his family.  I accept that the Government has confirmed that position in a meeting with his parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The reports of the Garda and the PSNI clearly indicate that persons who were or are members of the Provisional IRA were responsible for this murder, which gives rise to the question of authorisation.  This element of plausible denial cannot be allowed to continue.  The essential problem is the continued existence of the structures of the IRA, which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform confirmed on 30 January.  That structure, which exists against the background of a peace process agreed by everybody, uses fear, intimidation and bullying to ensure good people will not speak out.  If there is to be any legacy for a fine young man like Paul Quinn or the peace process, it should be the complete disbandment of the IRA.  The Minister noted that the Provisional IRA has been on ceasefire since 1997 and is not currently involved in terrorist or criminal activity.  I respect the efforts made in respect of decommissioning but the situation of plausible denial cannot be allowed to continue.  A person arranged for a so-called punishment beating to be carried out.  People were instructed to be <i>in situ</i> and a young man was murdered.  One does not use surgical gloves, balaclavas, boiler suits and iron bars unless premeditated savagery and murder are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">If good people do not speak out, the peace process will be seriously challenged.  I admire the courage and Christian generosity of the Quinn family in dealing with their enormous loss.  If there is to be a legacy for Paul Quinn and the other 3,000 lives lost in the Troubles, the peace process cannot be made to stand over bad justice.  Those involved should declare that the IRA is finally disbanded so that fear, intimidation and bullying can be removed from a swathe of countryside.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_137">The murder of Paul Quinn last October in County Monaghan shocked the nation.  The brutal nature of the killing was particularly disturbing.  Both Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil suggested in the aftermath that Paul Quinn's death was linked to criminality.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs later retracted their statements and irrespective of the motive behind Paul Quinn's death, his murder — like any other murder — was unacceptable.  There can never be a valid reason or justification for a gang of masked thugs to lure a young man to an isolated farm and beat him to death.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">I do not believe that Paul Quinn was involved in criminality.  He was simply a young man who refused to bow and scrape to the racketeering, self-appointed hard men in his area.  Whatever his supposed error as adjudged by those Mafia-type bosses taking on the role of judge and jury, he paid the ultimate price.  His death shone a light on a world with which many of us in the Republic are unfamiliar.  He came from the small village of Cullyhanna in the heart of south Armagh, an area long considered unsafe for the agents of law and order because of the strong republican presence in the area.  In the immediate aftermath of his murder, it was unfortunate that the British and Irish Governments rushed to judgment by ruling out direct republican paramilitary involvement.  As we search for the truth months later, we see how unhelpful these statements were.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">What we have seen following Paul Quinn's death is that while we have peace in Northern Ireland, some areas remain outside mainstream civil society.  It is clear that the Mafia-like situation that existed prior to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 persists at a certain level a decade later.  The factors which created the vacuum and allowed an IRA dominated subculture to develop in south Armagh are well known.  However, we are supposed to have moved on from the tragic era of the Troubles.  The Good Friday Agreement was overwhelmingly endorsed by all the people of this island.  We now have a functioning Northern Executive at Stormont that is charged with governing the domestic affairs of Northern Ireland.  The PSNI is the legitimate police force in the North, just as the Garda Síochána is the legitimate police force in the South.  If punishment for alleged crimes is to be meted out, that is a matter for the police and the courts and not for individuals or gangs.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Alleged links between criminality and those who took Paul Quinn's life in a brutal manner have been the subject of some discussion in the media.  A recent "Prime Time Investigates" documentary on fuel smuggling from the South to the North revealed that the shed where Paul Quinn was beaten to death is sometimes used by smugglers to store fuel.  The same programme revealed that legitimate authorities are simply afraid to go after the smugglers because of their fear of Mafia-style intimidation and the physical violence evidenced in so-called punishment beatings. This situation is simply unacceptable.  Paul Quinn's tragic death must be a watershed for the Border area.  It must be the catalyst that marks the end of Mafia-style rule and the beginning of a meaningful rule of law in every part of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The people of south Armagh and beyond have been vocal in their condemnation of Paul's killers.  It is clear they no longer want to live in a society dominated by fear and intimidation.  They have the same right to feel safe and secure and live free of threats, intimidation and fear as all other citizens of this island.  However, they must put their trust in the legitimate authorities.  Yesterday, Chief Constable Hugh Orde issued a stark warning that "Northern Ireland is facing an imminent threat from a group of disorganised but dangerous dissident republicans".  He stressed that co-operation between the people and the police is essential to neutralising this threat.  I hope his plea for co-operation will be heeded.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Our Government and the Northern Ireland authorities must work closely together to deliver a real peace to south Armagh and to create and foster a civil society in which people feel secure and protected by the legitimate police force.  There is much scope for North-South co-operation on this issue.  The Garda Síochána and the PSNI must work together.  The obvious place for such co-operation to continue is in investigating the appalling murder of Paul Quinn and bringing his killers to justice.  I wish the Garda and the PSNI every success in this regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_116">
          <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_143">It is not my custom to become involved, on a regular basis, in commenting on Northern Ireland affairs in this House.  I have, however, been very much aware of events that took place there over the years.  The brutal and savage murder of Paul Quinn is a reflection on everyone North and South of the Border.  It was carried out with military precision by a group of murderous thugs and carefully planned and professionally executed.  Out of respect for Paul's parents, who are present to witness this debate, I will not dwell on the pathological savagery and cruelty which occurred in our State on that dreadful night.  It is sufficient to say that a young man, a mere teenager, was bludgeoned to death.  Regardless of the crime, savages would not inflict it on one of their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">A family has been left devastated, terrified by the nightmare visited upon it.  For the Quinns, there is, as yet, no visible avenue of escape or relief from their terrible ordeal.  To add insult to grievous injury, it was alleged that the innocent young victim of this crime died as a result of a feud between criminals.  It is to our shame and a sad reflection on every one of us that such a vicious and vindictive spin, which emanated from highly-placed politicians who hold positions of responsibility in Northern Ireland, was initially swallowed hook, line and sinker by prominent politicians on the Government side in the Republic.  At least this malevolent version of the atrocity has at last been repudiated by senior Government figures.  As far as I am aware, however, it has not yet been withdrawn by its authors.  Shame on those who would attempt to slander an innocent victim.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Since this murderous atrocity was perpetrated, a vow of silence has been imposed on an entire community.  While a large gang participated in that dreadful orgy of violence, no witnesses have as yet come forward.  An <i>omerta</i> in the best traditions of the Sicilian Mafia is in existence.  Weasel words have been spoken but there has been no justice for either Paul Quinn or his family.  This is not an isolated incident.  There was much hypocritical condemnation of the McCartney murder but no witnesses came forward and there has been no justice or closure in respect of it.  Approximately 12 miles from where I live in the constituency of Donegal South-West, a man named Denis Donaldson — I did not know him but perhaps other Members did — was murdered in an attack that was carried out with the same military precision as that employed in the killing of Paul Quinn.  Mr. Donaldson’s murder, which was also publicly condemned, remains unsolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Why are all these investigations running into the sand?  It is glaringly obvious that community and mind control are being imposed.  People know the truth of what happened and they also know who was responsible, but they have not yet been able to garner the courage to come forward as witnesses.  This yoke of terror and intimidation must be removed if we are to become a civilised and law-abiding community.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">How is it possible to justify the devolution of responsibility for the administration of justice to those who live in a community or an area in which murderers are protected, even if the latter is the result of fear and intimidation?  Perhaps the death of Paul Quinn, who lies in a cold grave, might initiate a process that will remove the heavy hand of intimidation from a community and allow its members to live by the accepted standards of decency, democracy and the rule of law.  I refer here to civil, not mob, law.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">I extend my condolences and my sympathy to Paul's parents, his relations and the members of his community, who, like us, are decent and respectable people.  I hope the heavy hand of intimidation will be removed.  I also hope that, sooner rather than later, people will come forward to help bring about closure in respect of this atrocious murder.</p>

          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_149">I wish to share time with Deputy Sherlock.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The murder of Paul Quinn in County Monaghan on 20 October last left a family bereaved and a community shocked and created huge political reverberations in the Monaghan and Armagh areas.  Appalling as it was, the murder of Paul Quinn was only one of many shocking and brutal killings we have witnessed on this island in the past 35 years.  Why should his death have received such public attention when so many other equally brutal murders have been forgotten?  Part of the reason that this murder has created such an impact on the public consciousness is the cruel and premeditated nature of the killing.  Even more so, it is that Paul's murder took place at a time when we all hoped that we had seen the last killings of this type and when the people of south Armagh and north Monaghan in particular hoped that their communities had at last been freed from the blight of terrible violence that had taken such a toll.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Let us recall the basic facts of the case as we know them.  On Saturday, 20 October last, a group of young men were forcibly taken by an armed gang to an isolated shed in a remote area of north Monaghan.  One of them was forced to phone his friend, Paul Quinn, asking him to come to the shed on the promise that there was some work available.  When Paul arrived he was taken captive and removed to another smaller shed.  Over a prolonged period his friends heard the sickening thud of iron bars and nailed cudgels on human flesh and his futile cries for mercy.  Then there was silence.  When his friends managed to free themselves they found Paul Quinn, his body broken and brutalised, still barely alive but clearly in a very critical condition.  Despite the prompt arrival of an ambulance and the best efforts of medical staff, Paul died in hospital in Drogheda later that evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">More than three months later, no one has been brought to justice for this shocking crime.  The family and friends of Paul Quinn immediately claimed that well known members of the Provisional IRA had been responsible for his murder.  Leading Republican figures at local and national level denied this.  However, these denials were accompanied by a cynical campaign to denigrate the reputation of Paul Quinn.  Not content with taking his life, those responsible were also determined to take his character.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">The family and friends of Paul Quinn have since organised a vigorous campaign to ensure that his death is not forgotten and that those responsible are brought to justice.  With a number of other Members, I attended a packed and passionate public meeting shortly before Christmas in the community centre in Crossmaglen, which was organised by the Campaign to Secure Justice for Paul Quinn.  As local people expressed their anger about what had been done to one of their own, I was reminded of the words of Pádraig Pearse, "beware of the risen people".</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Those who spoke were in the main people from the local community and the vast majority were absolutely certain members of the Provisional IRA had murdered Paul Quinn.  Historically, Crossmaglen is in the middle of a republican heartland but there was particular anger directed at local Sinn Féin representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">Speaker after speaker got up and told of their own experiences over 35 years of violence.  They spoke of things they had to put up with at the hands of the IRA and the security forces during the course of what they described as "the war".  They said with one voice that enough was enough, they wanted no more killings and they wanted the killers of Paul Quinn brought to justice.  Given the traditions in the area, I was struck by the extent to which people were prepared to urge those with any information on the killing to hand it over to the PSNI.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I have little doubt members of the Provisional IRA carried out the attack on Paul Quinn and were responsible for his murder.  I do not know if the murder was sanctioned at a higher level but regardless of this, the provisional movement has an obligation to face up to its responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">There are some striking parallels with the murder of Robert McCartney in Belfast three years ago, for which members of the Provisional IRA were also responsible.  On that occasion also, there were condemnations from provisional leaders, sympathy for the McCartney family and public pleas to co-operate with the PSNI.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Despite the fact that there were a large number of people in a public place involved in the McCartney murder, just one person has been charged with murder and two others with affray.  When push came to shove, those who knew who killed Robert McCartney, those who witnessed his murder, were unwilling to co-operate with the PSNI.  This must not be allowed to happen in the case of Paul Quinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I accept the transition from paramilitarism to democracy will not always be smooth.  There will be slip-ups along the way and errors of judgment made.  I also acknowledge the significant progress made in the political process in Northern Ireland and the changes brought about by the leadership of the republican movement.  It took longer than we would have liked but the achievement of decommissioning and the effective standing down of the IRA cleared the way for the restoration of the Assembly and Executive in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">There is now a choice to be made by members of the provisional movement.  Do they stand with the murderers of Paul Quinn or do they stand with the Quinn family and the people of south Armagh?  Are they prepared to go beyond paying ritual lip service to the principle of co-operation with the lawfully established police authorities, set up under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, and ensure that those responsible are brought to justice and convicted?</p>
          <p eId="para_161">We sign up for the full democratic package or not at all, as one cannot be half a democrat.  Failure to ensure the murderers of Paul Quinn are brought to justice will rekindle doubts about the bone fides of republican leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">I cannot let this occasion pass without making some reference to the injudicious comments made by the Taoiseach in the aftermath of the killing in which he clearly implied that Paul Quinn had been involved in criminal activity.  I do not know if the Taoiseach had been poorly briefed or if his desire not to do anything to destabilise the delicate political position in Northern Ireland clouded his judgment.  However, the result of his comments was to play into the hands of his killers, provide ammunition for those who wanted to denigrate Paul Quinn and add enormously to the trauma of the Quinn family.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">In fairness to the Taoiseach, six weeks later he eventually withdrew those comments and publicly stated that Paul Quinn was not involved in criminal activity, but these groundless comments should never have been made in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">I again extend my sympathy to the Quinn family.  I hope this debate will in some way assist the process of achieving justice for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">I thank Deputy McManus for sharing her time.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">How can I speak for Paul Quinn in a way that does not patronise his family or politicise his memory?  How can I, who did not know him personally, possibly speak in a manner that will pay adequate tribute to his independence and single-mindedness that ultimately cost him his life?</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I can only speak to the fact that neither he or his family nor the community of Cullyhanna has received justice.  If we are to subscribe to the ideals of the republic and all the beliefs going with it, we must speak up for Paul Quinn.  We must condemn, without equivocation, his murder, and that condemnation must come from all facets of the political spectrum.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">If there are those who seek to equivocate, they must reverse their position.  If this island, which has left so many families bereft of justice, is to move on we must hold Paul Quinn up as an example that justice can prevail.  In order for this to happen, those in the shadows must be rooted out and take responsibility for their actions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_169">I begin by extending my continuing sympathy and that of Sinn Féin to the family of Paul Quinn.  Their grief at the loss of their loved one was compounded by the horrendous manner in which Paul was done to death.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The brutal murder took place in my constituency, in my home county of Monaghan, at Oram last October.  It shocked and sickened people in the Border counties and throughout Ireland.  As I stated at the time, as soon as the murder became known it sent shockwaves through our communities.  It was a despicable act of brutality and murder carried out by people who deserve only the contempt and the condemnation of society.  For a group of men to lure a man in such a way and then to beat him mercilessly until he died is to be deplored in any circumstances, at any time and wherever it occurs.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">I reiterate here what I and other Sinn Féin representatives stated at the time and have stated many times since.  Anyone who has any information related to this murder, no matter how small or insignificant they think it may be, should pass it on without delay to the Garda or the PSNI.  There should be nowhere for the criminals responsible for this murder to hide.  They are criminals because they committed a criminal act of murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I have seen no evidence that would link this crime to republicans but regrettably such claims have been made and continue to be made.  I do not accept such claims and I emphasise in the strongest terms that it would be totally irrelevant if any of these criminals claimed at any time to be associated with republicanism.  The reality is that this act of murder criminalises anyone who took part in it, irrespective of what politics they hold or may have held.  The perpetrators are criminal murderers and that is the bottom line.  I can be no clearer than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">There have been attempts to taint Irish republicanism with this crime and to taint the people of south Armagh.  The only people tainted, stained and shamed by this murder are those individuals who carried it out and anyone else who may have assisted in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">As I stated here in the Dáil on 18 December, there has been a tendency on the part of some to determine responsibility.  I caution Members against jumping to conclusions.  The family has a view, as do others who are articulating their view.  However, it is only through the respective police authorities, North and South, that the truth can be established and the full rigours of the law can be brought to bear on the event.  That is what we want to see.  We want those responsible for the murder of Paul Quinn to be apprehended, brought before a court of law, convicted and sentenced for their crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The question has been raised as to whether the victim of this murder, Paul Quinn, may or may not have at any time been involved in criminal activity.  As I have said before, that has no bearing whatsoever on the heinousness of the crime of murder committed against him.  What happened to him was an absolute outrage and I want to make that very clear, as I did last December, for fear that some sense of difference would be promoted about whether he had or had not been so involved.  I did not know Paul Quinn or know of him.  I do not know the facts of his life story.  Irrespective of the full facts, and they may reveal themselves in time, it is absolutely imperative that it is stated loudly and clearly that what happened was an outrage and a crime, and absolutely indefensible in any circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">I appeal to all who genuinely seek and support truth and justice for the Quinn family not to compound this family's distress by fuelling, by actions or words, the destructive efforts of those who have already pointed the finger of blame at innocent members of the community in Cullyhanna and beyond and who have engaged in misguided and misdirected acts of retribution against the same innocent people.  This too must stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">There is no ambiguity whatsoever in the Sinn Féin position on the murder of Paul Quinn, as I hope I have made clear here today.  Sadly and predictably, some of the siren voices we are so used to hearing and others of more recent vintage have attempted to use this murder to feed their politically motivated antipathy to Sinn Féin.  That is of no service to the Quinn family or to the pursuit of the murderers of Paul Quinn.  It serves only as a distraction and for that reason I will not elaborate on it here.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Instead, I conclude by urging anyone with any information on this murder to come forward with it and to assist the Garda and the PSNI in their pursuit of the killers.  I join others today in again extending sincerest and deepest sympathy to the parents and family of Paul Quinn.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MargaretConlon" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Deputy Margaret Conlon</from>
          <p eId="para_179">I raised this issue on the Adjournment on 24 October 2007 and it is good that we are having this debate today.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Once again, I extend my deepest sympathy to Paul Quinn's parents, Stephen and Briege, and to his family and friends who are seeking the truth about, and justice for, his murder.  I welcome them to the Visitors Gallery today.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">This murder was one of the most horrific crimes ever committed against anybody in this country.  It takes only one person to kill another with one blow.  This young man was lured to an isolated rural area and manhandled out to a farm shed where people with bats, crowbars and pick axe handles brutally ended his life.  The point has been made that these savages did not mean to kill Paul Quinn but what other outcome could be expected when a gang of masked men repeatedly attacked one lonely man with weapons, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said this morning?</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Several politicians were quick to tell us that they knew who did not commit this awful atrocity.  There are, however, people who know who did and who gave instructions for this savage act to be carried out.  There are people with blood on their hands to whom conscience is alien.  As a public representative for the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, where this heinous crime was carried out, I hope and expect that any honourable citizen of this island, North or South of the Border, who knew anything, will give such information to the Garda or the PSNI.  I commend the Garda and the PSNI on their co-operation and dedication in the ongoing investigation into Paul's murder.  It is a sign of significant progress when the recognised police forces on both sides of the Border work together with a common purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I attended a public meeting in Castleblayney after Christmas, attended by hundreds from North and South of the Border, many from south Armagh.  Their wish was to find justice and truth for Paul but also to be able to live and conduct their daily lives, to go where they liked, visit friends and family and socialise in a community not ruled by fear or intimidation.  Unfortunately, there are still some members of this community who operate to their own laws and standards and this cannot and will not be tolerated in the Ireland of today.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, we have come a long way.  We must not allow anything to undo this good work but in south Armagh we still have a good distance to travel.  As a republican, I will always advocate a peaceful resolution to a problem.  We have learned over the years that violence is not a resolution to any dispute or cause, and the people who committed this barbarous act are nothing but thugs.  I commend the family of Paul Quinn on repeatedly calling for no retaliation.  I repeat that call because retaliation would not serve any purpose or further the investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">As I said in my speech on the Adjournment last October, the wall of silence that surrounded the murder of Robert McCartney in Belfast must not be repeated in this case.  Nobody in this country has the right to take the law into their own hands.  In the McCartney case, the complete lack of respect for human life, coupled with walls of silence, has prevented a prosecution since that awful killing in Belfast, on a bleak day in January 2005.  It is my earnest hope that this will not happen in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I was happy before Christmas to facilitate the meetings of the parents of Paul Quinn with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister assured Stephen and Briege that the investigation was active and ongoing, an assertion repeated today.  The Taoiseach said to Briege Quinn that the only criminals involved in this crime were the thugs who murdered Paul, with which I concur.  It serves no purpose to politicise Paul's death.  The central fact is the brutal death of a young man, an innocent life cruelly taken away by thugs who displayed no humanity or decency.  These traits are alien to the savages who committed this crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for his commitment to ensuring an active investigation and the Garda and the PSNI for their vigour and determination in attempting to solve this heinous crime.  I pledge that as a Deputy for this area, I will continue to highlight this issue at local and national level.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">A life was wiped out by this murder.  There was not merely one victim of this crime as a community is in mourning.  Paul Quinn's friends, who unwittingly were forced to call Paul to his death, have been badly affected and some of them have received threats to their own lives.  Ultimately, his family remains devastated by this heinous crime and must live with the consequences of the ruthless and savage actions of those thugs for the rest of their lives.  No parent should be obliged to endure what Stephen and Briege Quinn are going through.  They never will be able to grieve properly while the perpetrators of this crime remain at large.  Were justice to be done, the perpetrators brought to account and a new peace to emerge in south Armagh, it would be a lasting memorial to the life of Paul Quinn.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_190">I thank my party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, for meeting Briege and Stephen Quinn in Castleblayney and for following through on his commitment to facilitate these statements in Dáil Éireann.  I also thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and all concerned for agreeing to them.  It constitutes an opportunity to put on record Members' anger and repulsion at the murder of the Quinns' son and brother, Paul.  His murder was premeditated and was carried out in the most cruel way in my constituency in Oram, County Monaghan.  I welcome to the Gallery Mr. Stephen Quinn, his son and daughter, Paul's aunt and other relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">It is not acceptable for any politician or individual to try to justify such a judge, jury and execution system in any country, let alone in respect of the peace process.  These statements give all Members a chance to clear the record, which is important for the future.  I note the Quinn family seeks a future without any other deaths or retaliation.  People from all political backgrounds and none must co-operate with both the Garda and the PSNI so that those responsible can be put behind bars.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Margaret Conlon, already stated that more young people are under threat in this region.  In recent years, many others have been badly beaten but are afraid even to make statements because they fear for their lives in south County Armagh.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Those who murdered Paul Quinn must be brought to justice, otherwise this would be an unacceptable result of all the efforts for peace.  Yesterday witnessed the return of the PSNI on to the roads and streets.  People have been found buying guns in eastern Europe and districts still lie under fear and are controlled without PSNI involvement.  South Armagh is not the only problem area, as two PSNI officers have been shot in other areas.  I know from first-hand experience that loyalist districts also are causing serious problems and this issue is not limited to south Armagh or republican areas.  Such districts also must be brought under police control.  There must and can be only one army and police force in a democratic country.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The PSNI, the Garda and the Customs and Excise have had some success in Border areas on other issues in the recent past.  The two Governments must provide whatever resources are necessary to bring the murderers of Paul Quinn to justice and give other young people the right to live.  Twelve or 14 people could not be involved in such a brutal murder without someone being aware of what happened or who organised it.  It is not a secret that the people involved were wearing balaclavas, special uniforms and other items that all had hoped to forget.  I plead to their consciences, whoever they are, to break this cycle as they may be the next victims otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">While I welcome the statement made today by my constituency colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, I hope that all his colleagues in south Armagh will be as clear.  I assure Members that Fine Gael has not raised this issue in the House for political reasons.  It brought the issue into the House to provide justice to the Quinn family.  Paul Quinn died in the most heinous and tragic circumstances and were his death to go unsolved, it would raise major questions regarding the reason people are unable to speak out.  Undoubtedly, many people know exactly who was responsible for this deed.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">I congratulate all those who attended public meetings in Cullyhanna, Crossmaglen and Castleblayney.  My colleague, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, accompanied me to the meeting in Crossmaglen while others accompanied me to the meeting in Castleblayney.  Those meetings provided a clear indication of the high levels of support for the Quinn family, as well as the opportunity for people to speak in public on the problems and to clear Paul Quinn's name.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Young people in south Armagh have as much a right to freedom and opportunity as anyone else on our island home.  Let the word go out loud and clear that democracy and justice, based on the rule of law, is the only way forward now and in future.  The meetings in Castleblayney and Crossmaglen that I attended were illuminating as for the first time in the history of the Troubles, people were prepared to speak openly and show their support.  I appreciate that Deputy Liz McManus travelled all the way from Wicklow to attend that meeting and that my other colleagues from all parties in County Monaghan attended the meeting in Castleblayney.  Tremendous openness and a great commitment to law and order was displayed.  Such commitment can only be proven to be real if it can be seen that people are prepared to come forward without fear and without the awareness that they face death in order that the Quinn murder can be solved.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">I have spoken to many people privately since Paul Quinn's murder.  People have come forward and have asked to meet me privately.  It has been a revelation to hear of the level of threats and the pressures that exist in that locality.  Having worked with all parties in the peace process, I have no doubt that all parties represented in this House are committed to it.  However, the only manner in which this can be proved in the long term is to effect the restoration of law and order in all parts of the country and to see real progress in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">I again sympathise with the Quinn family, their relations and many supporters.  I sympathise and pray they will be granted the strength to carry on.  Unfortunately, Mrs. Briege Quinn is not present today.  She was under great pressure in terms of her health when Deputy Enda Kenny and I met her in Castleblayney and I realise she did not wish to go through the experience of this debate.  The manner in which Paul was murdered and his body was abandoned is inexpressible and unbelievable.  When Stephen told the details to Deputy Kenny, Briege simply could not take it any longer.  I thank her for coming that day to Castleblayney in order that Members witnessed the reality and pressures experienced by the family at first hand.  I hope and pray that God will give them the strength to carry on and that they will be seen to receive the justice they deserve through the incarceration of the perpetrators.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">The murder of Paul Quinn on 20 October was an appalling atrocity.  Although months have passed since it occurred, our feelings still go out the parents, family and relatives of Paul Quinn, and to the members of his community.  Two issues arise from his murder, the need for the perpetrators to be brought to justice and the need for proper law and order in south Armagh.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">A few weeks after the murder, I called to the Quinn household in Cullyhanna in the company of councillor Geraldine Donnelly.  Despite the enormity of the tragedy, I was impressed by the dignity of the family.  Briege Quinn told me she desired two things, that Paul's name be cleared of allegations of criminality and that the perpetrators be brought to justice.  Paul Quinn's name has been cleared by the Government here and the Taoiseach spoke to Briege.  I was present at the meeting.  The Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party also accepts that Paul Quinn was an innocent victim.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">On Mrs. Quinn's second desire, that the perpetrators be brought to justice, I was impressed by the fact that she wanted to achieve this within the law and in no other way.  As I have done many times since the murder, I appeal to anybody who has any information whatsoever to give it to the Garda or the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI.  I am very impressed with the level of co-operation and the manner in which the investigation has been carried out by both the Garda and PSNI.  It is very encouraging to those of us who live along the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">The second issue of fundamental importance is the restoration of law and order to south Armagh.  The overwhelming majority of people in the region are decent and law abiding but there are thugs who take the law into their own hands.  It is encouraging at present to note the burning desire of so many to see a restoration of the rule of law and a normal society re-established.  This has been highlighted by the hundreds of people who have attended the meetings organised by the Quinn's support group throughout south Armagh and in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, one of which was held in Castleblayney.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">It is important that so many people, particularly locals, are prepared to speak out very strongly about the fact that they want to see the perpetrators of the crime brought to justice and that they want a restoration of normality to the locality.  It is the first time in a generation in such circumstances that so many ordinary people — a small number was always prepared to come forward — have spoken so strongly about the need to bring the perpetrators to justice and restore law and order.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">There is now an opportunity to re-establish the rule of law in south Armagh.  We must all work together, including the people in the locality and those in the wider Border area.  The two Governments must grasp the opportunity that exists because it may not last.  The Garda and PSNI also have an important role to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Who is afraid of normality?  We all want to see normal community policing sooner rather than later and due process in the courts of law.  I hope that people will never again live in fear of external sanctions or be beaten to death with iron bars in Oram or anywhere else.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_208">I, too, convey my sympathy to the Quinn family on the brutal murder of their son Paul outside Castleblayney some months ago.  By any standards the murder was extremely brutal.  There have been very brutal murders in the Border area and across the Six Counties over the past 30 years but this was as brutal as they come.  Paul Quinn was 21 and was lured to his death in dreadful circumstances.  One can only speculate on the physical and emotional impact of the murder on his family .</p>
          <p eId="para_209">It is simply unacceptable that this type of brutal murder could be perpetrated on anybody.  Everybody, young and old, should be entitled to go about his or her daily business without feeling intimidated and without the fear of abduction or being lured to his or her death.  One should be able to live, travel, work and socialise in one's community without the fear of being intimidated or frightened in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The reality is that the basic tenets of democracy are at stake.  Peace in Northern Ireland has been a long time coming.  We all welcome it and are delighted it is bedding in so well and successfully but the fundamental principle at stake is the right of the individual to be able to go about his or her daily life and to have his or her interests protected by the institutions in his or her area.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The people who perpetrated the murder are thugs by any standards.  We all exhort anybody with information that would help both the Garda and PSNI in bringing the perpetrators to justice to make it available as quickly as possible.  I congratulate the Garda and PSNI on their intensive work in investigating the case and compiling the evidence.  We all hope they will be able to bring about a successful prosecution.  This would help in some way to ease the pain that has been visited on the Quinn family.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The circumstances of the investigation into the murder, which occurred near the Border just outside Castleblayney, and the cohesive nature of the work of the Garda and PSNI bode well for the future of peace and harmony in the area.  We all hope the two police forces are successful and that the perpetrators will be brought to justice, thereby sending out a signal to anybody else who wants to contemplate indulging in such activity that it has no place in the Ireland of 2008.</p>

          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_213">I welcome this debate.  It is very important that it take place in this Chamber.  With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, I would have believed this debate warranted the presence of a senior Minister for its full duration.  The inquiry into the murder has led to very serious allegations which, if true, will have significant and serious ramifications north and south of the Border.  Justice must be seen to be done even if heaven falls in this case.  We must face up to the fact that the people I heard in open debate in Crossmaglen are absolutely convinced that the people who murdered Paul Quinn were members of the Provisional IRA, contrary to what the Minister said in his speech.  The ramifications of this fact, if it be true, are very serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Certain actions must be taken to deal with the situation.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Ó Caoláin had to say.  I say to him that I very much welcome the peace we have attained in this country.  I very much welcome the fact the IRA is no longer engaged in a campaign of murder.  It is also to be welcomed that Sinn Féin is fully playing its part in the administration of the Six Counties, as its members call it, or, as we would say, of Northern Ireland.  That should not be put at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">If this death means anything and if any good is to come of it, this House, the Government and the British Government should insist that the IRA disband and cease to exist.  The meeting to which I referred was an open debate, where people went into a hall in the heart of Crossmaglen and spoke openly and strongly, with a lifetime of experience, of their desire to be rid forever of this blight on their lives.  Nobody to whom I spoke expressed a wish for the Northern Ireland Executive to fall.  Nor do I want to see it fall.  However, there is a desire for change.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">A person to whom I spoke put it properly when he said that he had been intimidated, on the one hand, by the British Army and the RUC for most of his adult life and, on the other hand, by the IRA.  He has had no peace in his life.  Either one side or the other, he observed, was constantly intimidating ordinary people because of events that took place in the area.  This person wants rid of both sides.  The British Army, thankfully, is gone, and it is time now for the Provisional IRA to cease to exist.  That would be a fitting outcome of this most appalling and savage murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I listened carefully to Deputy Ó Caoláin's speech.  I do not accept the words he used.  I can only paraphrase what he said but he referred to the question of whether the late Paul Quinn had or had not been involved in criminal activity.  The Taoiseach has expressed his belief that Mr. Quinn was not involved in such activity.  I acknowledge the importance of the contribution of Sinn Féin in bringing about peace.  I make no argument in that regard.  However, the party should not continue to cast doubt on this man's character.  It is wrong to do so.  This country must move forward.  Crossmaglen is only three quarters of an hour from my home, but the last five miles of the journey are through an area that has witnessed the most appalling and savage killing for many years.  Everybody is delighted those killings have ceased, apart from this particular evil attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I remind the Taoiseach and his Government that the future of the peace process will depend on the outcome of this case.  If the perpetrators are apprehended, people will begin to have confidence in the effectiveness of going to the Garda and the PSNI.  This will allow for a new mood in south Armagh and all along the Border.  People in the area have told me they are in fear of the former IRA volunteers who walk the roads of south Armagh.  They believe these individuals to be current members of the IRA.  Significant and serious intimidation is ongoing.  Deputy Crawford and I met people who gave us a list of incidents of intimidation and beatings that have occurred in the last three to four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Such incidents must end forever.  That is what the Quinn family wants.  Deputy Ó Caoláin said that certain people in the area were being blamed for this murder and intimidated for that reason.  The words of Briege and Stephen Quinn are clear on this point.  They want no retribution and do not support or condone any such action.  The Quinn family has no agenda for retribution.  Rather, their agenda is to seek the justice to which they are entitled.  That is the way forward for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">My deepest sympathies go to the Quinn family.  On meeting them, one's instinct is one of absolute conviction and support for what they know to be true, that their son was not a criminal or thug and that he was evilly, morally and appallingly done to death.  Mr. Quinn's family has no doubt that the Government, Garda and PSNI are doing their best.  There is total acceptance of that and support for them.  What the family wants, and I support them in this, is for the IRA to be disbanded for all time.  One of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was released this week having serving the sentence he was given under due process.  There must be an end to all of that.  I ask Deputy Ó Caoláin and his Sinn Féin colleagues to go to the IRA as it presently exists and put the case that it is time to disband.  If it does so, the entire organisational structure and historical ethos to which Deputy Crawford referred will be gone forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Justice must be done and must be seen to be done in this case.  The Government must have the courage to say to Sinn Féin that it must disband the IRA.  We want it gone forever.  Nobody is saying the Executive should fall.  However, there must be some change as a result of this murder.  The absolute conviction of the Quinn family and of the others at that meeting in Crossmaglen is so crystal clear that it has 100% credibility.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Seán Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_222">I thank my colleagues for their contributions.  It is fitting that we discuss the killing of Paul Quinn in this House.  This was a well planned and brutally executed killing.  It is gratifying, though not unexpected, that the House should generally have spoken with one voice on this matter.  I hope the Quinn family can take some small comfort from the expressions of sympathy and support from all sides during the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I add my voice to those calling for witnesses to come forward.  The importance of this cannot be overestimated.  I thank my colleagues who have joined in appealing again for assistance from people in the local area.  As the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, made clear in this opening statement, there is no information available to the Garda that there was an organisational involvement by the Provisional movement in the killing.  However, as has been stated by Members in this House and others outside the House, there are suspicions that people with connections to that movement were involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">We must be cautious about discussing the detail of what is an ongoing investigation.  I am anxious that nothing should be said that would jeopardise the chances of successful convictions.  We have made clear time and again that criminality of any type will not be tolerated from any group, North or South.  In this regard, the Minister welcomes the condemnation of this crime by Members on all sides of the House as well as the various public statements that anyone who has information on this crime should pass it to the Garda or the PSNI.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The Minister spoke of a new optimism in regard to Northern Ireland.  This optimism is born of the hard work of people across the political spectrum who were willing to look to the future rather than focus on the past.  The next great challenge for Northern Ireland is the successful devolution of policing and justice responsibilities to the Assembly.  The timing of this next step is ultimately a matter for the Assembly itself.  The Government hopes the May deadline set out in the St. Andrews Agreement will be adhered to.  The Minister looks forward to working with his Northern Ireland equivalent to strengthen further the type of co-operation already evidenced by the investigation into Paul Quinn's killing.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">As the Minister mentioned in his opening remarks, the Taoiseach spoke with Paul's mother and father at a meeting before Christmas.  He reassured them that it was never his intention, in anything he said in response to questions about any wider implications that this case may have, to make an issue of Paul's character.  Mr. and Mrs. Quinn accepted the Taoiseach's assurances.  I do not believe it is particularly helpful to seek to score points against the Taoiseach in relation to such a horrific incident.  I and the Government have no problem stating categorically that the murder of Paul Quinn was not related in any way to any involvement of by him in criminal activities.  It is no secret that arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland, there are small pockets in Northern Ireland where there has been a lack of real policing in the past.  That vacuum was often filled by others to the detriment of all.  I am glad this is now changing.  The people are saying that those who seek to take advantage of that vacuum are not wanted under any circumstances and I advise them to take heed.  I note with satisfaction the call from the Deputies in this regard.  The days of no go areas are finished.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">As the Minister said, anyone with information relevant to this crime should be encouraged to give it to the Garda or the PSNI.  I welcome calls from others in the House for people to co-operate with the Garda and the PSNI.  Achieving justice in this case is fundamentally a matter for the criminal justice system and I am sure all Members will join with me in offering full support to the Garda and the PSNI.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Deputies Kenny and McManus said there are people in the area of south Armagh who know who planned and carried out this murder.  I accept this to be the case and I respect what the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and others have said.  Anyone with information should bring it to the police.  This type of co-operation is essential to success in this case.  I again urge witnesses and anyone with relevant information to go to the police with it.  Let us stand against the murders and with the Quinn family.  In common with all Members I hope we can all look forward to the time when those responsible for this heinous crime are brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I thank my colleagues for spending this small amount of time remembering a young man whose life was cruelly and prematurely taken away.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_231">I move amendment No. 1:<entity refersTo="#bill.2007.43.dail.4_sub.amd_1" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_232">In page 4, line 2, to delete "person;" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_233">"person, or</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_234">(<i>d</i>) exploitation for financial gain;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">This amendment is to ensure that when dealing with human trafficking, we cover all angles and, as I explained on Committee Stage, not only labour exploitation, sexual exploitation or exploitation consisting of the removal of one or more organs of a person.  There are other occasions in which people are trafficked and I gave a number of examples on Committee Stage, including exploitation for financial gain.  I cited the example of the case in England of a seven year old child, Victoria Climbie, who was trafficked from the Ivory Coast to Europe by her aunt for the purpose of benefit fraud.  The aunt had promised Victoria's parents that she would give the little girl a better life and educational opportunities but in February 2000, she died in a hospital in England having suffered many months of horrific neglect, physical abuse and degrading treatment.  She was only eight years of age.  It was to become one of the worst cases of physical child abuse and exploitation ever documented in Britain, and probably beyond.  Victoria's aunt and her partner received life sentences for her murder.  That is an example of somebody being trafficked for financial gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">In a recent case it was alleged that financial gain was behind the trafficking of children from Chad by a French NGO.  That case is still being investigated but it is alleged that hundreds of children were being trafficked from Chad and Sudan — basically, from the Darfur region — to France supposedly for the purpose of adoption.  Some 300 families in France had seemingly paid money up-front for these children.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">This amendment tries to cover that type of eventuality.  Although benefit fraud in itself is illegal and somebody could be prosecuted for that, the trafficking of a child or any human being for the purpose of financial gain should be covered by this legislation.  It is a minor enough provision which, hopefully, would never be used as having such a law would discourage anybody from trafficking the likes of Victoria to our shores and exploiting them in such a way.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">However, I live in the real world and understand that human traffickers have no regard to national or international laws.  Therefore, the onus is on us as a society to end what is the slavery of the 21st century.  Considering the number of people being trafficked throughout the world, how many of them are being trafficked not only for prostitution but for benefit fraud and some other financial gain?  The estimate is that between 700,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked world-wide.  I do not know the estimate for this country, if there is one.  It is probably difficult to quantify unless people come forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">There is a considerable amount of trafficking into Europe.  Ireland is a member of the European Union and we obviously have similar levels to other countries.  We should try to ensure any legislation we enact covers all the angles and that is why I tabled this amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_130">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_240">The purpose of this amendment is to extend the meaning of trafficking into any activity which could be described as exploitation as long as the exploitation is carried out for the purpose of financial gain.  On Committee Stage, I indicated I was not disposed to extending the purposes for which a person could be trafficked beyond those established in the relevant international instruments on trafficking.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">It is important for the purposes of international co-operation, extradition and agreement on what amounts to trafficking to stay within the confines of the meaning given to trafficking in the relevant international instruments.  Indeed, the draft EU Council conclusions on trafficking in human beings unequivocally states that member states prepare and implement national and comprehensive action plans against trafficking in human beings adopting as a common definition the one existing in the Council Framework Decision on combatting trafficking in human beings.  I see no valid reason Ireland should break ranks and go our own way on how we prepare our legislation on trafficking in human beings.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">The reality of these offences is that a high degree of international co-operation will be necessary for their successful prosecution, investigation and detection.  It is important that we stay within the international framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I do not understand why Deputy Ó Snodaigh has tabled the amendment.  I am not convinced that this amendment will make any practical difference.  A provision was included in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, under which it was necessary to prove that a person was smuggled into Ireland for gain.  This has made it difficult.  The requirement to put in "for gain" has made it difficult to bring prosecutions under that legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_244">While I accept that it would be a departure from what we are expected to pass, we should always strive towards having the best possible legislation even though it may be ahead of other EU countries.  EU laws and other international conventions are based on what can be achieved as a consensus between the countries.  That would not prevent any country going beyond those laws and conventions, once the definitions include exactly what was agreed at European level.  I have given two examples, but people who are even more averse to trafficking and people who are the victims of trafficking would be able to give other examples of trafficking, such as trafficking for welfare fraud or for other types of financial gain.  These examples would not cover the position in which the seven year old English girl Victoria Climbie found herself.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I still believe that my amendment should be accepted.  This Bill is long overdue but it is welcome.  Given that we are tackling this properly, we should try to ensure that as many eventualities are covered for the future so that we do not end up in a situation where people evade the full rigours of the law.  Child neglect is a way of prosecuting somebody, as is benefit fraud, but they do not cover the specifics of the trafficking offence.  We can prosecute in a number of areas under different laws and I think we need to prosecute people for the offence of trafficking.  Hopefully that is what will happen with this Bill if this amendment is accepted or if some other mechanism is found to cover the eventualities I mentioned.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">I can look at what the Deputy suggested, but sexual and labour exploitation are comprehensively defined in this Bill and there can be no ambiguity about what they mean.  It is important we have accurate definitions in a criminal statute.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_250">3.—The Minister shall promulgate a code of victim's rights in respect of victims of trafficking which shall address the following issues:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_251">(<i>a</i>) protection of private life of victims;</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_268">(<i>q</i>) compensation and facilitating legal redress against traffickers.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Most people who have taken time to inform themselves about this Bill welcome it as going a significant way to tackling the issue of trafficking.  However, the same informed people also agree that the big defect in the Bill is an absence of the protection of victims' rights.  There is not as much public knowledge about this as one might expect.  The Minister took time out on Second Stage to set out very graphically the scale of human trafficking in today's global environment.  In so far as statistics are available to the international organisations concerned, it is now claimed that human trafficking is the third most lucrative international criminal trade, after drugs and arms.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I was completely taken aback at the extent of the response to a recent television programme, drawing attention to this issue.  People who never really thought about it did not appreciate that 800,000 people are being trafficked every year.  Against that scale and background, it would be very naive to think that Ireland somehow escaped the attention of those who were involved in this lucrative, international criminal enterprise.  We dealt with that on Second Stage, on Committee Stage and when we examined the Estimates of the Department and of the organisations working with people at the coalface of the trafficking problem in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The Minister has clearly made trafficking an offence, but he has made it plain that this Bill is purely a criminal law response and does not purport to go beyond that.  We know that he speaks in an environment where we have not ratified the international instruments because of defects in the law as it stands.  This Bill will advance us towards compliance, but it is not in itself sufficient.  The major defect, identified by people who are concerned and knowledgeable in this area, is in the protection of victims.  Unfortunately, the Minister has taken the position that that is not for this Bill and that he will address it to some extent in the immigration and residence Bill.  We have consistently said that these are two entirely separate matters.  The immigration and residence Bill is about a completely different phenomenon from that of trafficking.  All the international instruments suggest that the care, protection, assistance and provision of services to victims ought to be in the trafficking Bill itself.  The Minister has resisted that, which is a great pity.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I believe that this Bill will be undermined by the refusal to take on board the desirability of enshrining the protection of victims in the Bill.  It is entirely unrealistic to expect victims to come forward to use the criminal law provisions if they do not have a measure of reasonable protection.  That does not apply at the moment.  We are mainly talking about young women who have been brutalised, who find themselves in an alien environment, who very frequently may not have good knowledge of the language and who are fearful of those who have got control of their lives.  We expect them to come forward to make the criminal law provisions in this Bill effective.  Unless we provide them with nurture and protection, it is less likely that they will come forward.  That is the regrettable thing about the Minister's stance because otherwise, generally speaking, I support his Bill.  I acknowledge that it is a big step forward, but I do not understand the almost ideological resistance in the Department to inserting in the Bill a charter for the protection of victims.  I do not see why that is a big issue.  The Minister will, in effect, say: "The Deputy now knows I have done this in the immigration Bill".  In fact the Deputy does not quite know this because the Minister has dealt with the question of reflection and recovery in the immigration Bill, but that is all.  In any event, the immigration Bill only refers to people from outside the EEA.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The main trafficking in Ireland is from within the European Union, from poorer countries including the new accession states.  People from there are mainly those being trafficked into Ireland.  It is more lucrative for those engaged in this criminal enterprise to go to Prague, Latvia or wherever and strike the deals that have come to light in recent times in terms of trafficking into London, other British cities and undoubtedly here.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The Minister will agree that the immigration Bill applies only to non-EEA nationals, but insist that the others are from EU member states and, as such, have the rights of EU citizens.  That is true to a greater or lesser extent in terms of, for example, the labour laws.  It is the case, however, in the anecdotal knowledge of every Member of this House, that the labour laws are not being particularly well enforced for some of the migrant labour here.  There is a world of difference in the broad assertion that a young woman trafficked here from Lithuania is a citizen of the European Union, with attaching rights, and the actual circumstances of the person who has been trafficked.  They need protection around them.  They need to be proactively cared for if they are to heal, recover and be able to give evidence against those who trafficked them in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">The Minister has dealt with the recovery and reflection period and the question of temporary residence in the immigration Bill, but that is all.  He has not done any of the other things that are listed in my amendment.  I did not pluck these out of the sky, nor do I claim paternity of them.  They are drawn from various international instruments that suggest best practice.  Some of these are obvious and important, but they are not included either in this Bill or in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  A citizen of Bulgaria or Romania does not have the right to work here, but how is a young woman who has been brutalised in this type of exploitation supposed to support herself while she is waiting for such a case to come to trial?</p>
          <p eId="para_276">A number of issues are listed as regards medical and legal assistance, access to legal advice, accommodation and so on.  They are all spelt out.  The Department, while appearing to concede that we have been caught out and are not in line with international instruments and, therefore, should deal with the criminal law side of this issue, takes the position that otherwise Ireland is a civilised country and all of these matters can be addressed short of legislation.  I have not seen anything tangible from the Minister that might indicate whether he intends to put administrative measures in place that will be resourced and provide the particular aspects of protection that I mention.  Clearly, organisations working with people who have been trafficked want to see this in law.  If the Minister has set his face against that, they want commitments from him on the Dáil record about what he proposes to do to ensure there is access to some administrative procedures that will provide these kind of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">This is the big gap in the Bill.  I genuinely have difficulty understanding the resistance to it.  We are talking about a small number of people.  The Minister refers to the number of people being trafficked here as 100 or more.  Organisations working with them maintain it is a good deal more than that, and climbing.  However, it is still a relatively small, finite number and I find it difficult to understand why we cannot offer these people protections under our law.  It is plain that since the very poor economic areas of the European Union gained access to the Union, the phenomenon of young women either fleeing poverty to make a better life for themselves or being trafficked has been growing.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I instanced the case on Committee Stage which was published in a British Sunday newspaper recently involving a young woman from Lithuania, I believe, who only discovered when she arrived in London that she had been sold for €4,500 to an Albanian pimp.  She found herself in circumstances where she was expected to have sex with men 15 or 17 times a day — in respect of which she got £10 a day.  She had no knowledge when she left her home village that these were the circumstances in which she would find herself.  Without the protective cloak that I am suggesting, it is very difficult to how she could get out of that situation and I ask the Minister, even at this 12th hour, to reconsider.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_280">My amendment is similar to Deputy Rabbitte's, except for one minor change where I have inserted the phrase "which may be renewed".  If a temporary residence period or the equivalent period of recovery and reflection is provided for in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill as promised, it was also pledged at the time that protections would be contained in this Bill.  As Deputy Rabbitte has outlined, those protections involve a series of provisions to ensure not only that someone could remain within Ireland, in order to recover from whatever abuse and trauma he or she suffered as a victim of trafficking, but also a period of reflection to set down roots and perhaps co-operate with the Garda Síochána.  The period is set at 45 days and is slightly more than what was being sought by some of the groups, which was a minimum of 30 days.  In both amendments, we have sought a period of six months and for it then to be renewed.  Considering how slowly the wheels of justice move in this State, I believe that is an appropriate period.  It should be renewable to ensure that if a victim of trafficking were willing to take on the very dangerous course of exposing the trafficker and giving the evidence in court he or she would be protected when in our system and provided with the appropriate housing or shelter; medical, psychological and health care support; counselling, information on legal assistance, financial support; and the opportunity to try to recover and reintegrate into our society or their own country of origin.  We should also ensure they have the right to work and the right to access to a vocational education.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">A further amendment in my name deals with compensation or legal redress against traffickers.  There is a series of measures that I do not think are covered in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  What is contained in that Bill would be more appropriately included in this Bill and should be expanded upon greatly.  We do not want a situation where someone uses the period to recover and reflect on whether they will co-operate with the Garda and may be held, as are some people who are totally innocent of any wrongdoing, in Cloverhill Prison pending deportation.  What is the position for a person here?  All the Bill states is that they will not be deported.  That would mean they would be entitled to appropriate housing or shelter.  We need to ensure that does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">In Australia, for example, a young woman, a victim of trafficking, died in a detention centre in 2003, following which the Australian Government introduced an automatic humanitarian visa system to enable victims to remain on a temporary or a permanent basis depending on their individual circumstances.  Given that the victims are children or young women, it is regrettable the Bill does not deal with what exactly a victim of trafficking is entitled to and would be granted by the State.  It is estimated that 80% of the 800,000 people, or more, trafficked are women or children and 70% of them are being trafficked for sexual exploitation.  Let us think of the trauma those women and children have experienced by the time they come to the attention of the State or succeed in escaping the clutches of the human traffickers or those who hold them in bondage in slavery.  It would be appropriate that the amendments tabled by Deputy Rabbitte and me be taken on board and that the temporary residence permit which was renewable be taken on board.  It should be renewable to ensure that, for example, in the middle of a court case the victim does not end up facing other trauma, such as a deportation.  It should put be in writing that they know they are guaranteed the right to remain here while the court case is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The other point that should be taken on board is that the provision of safe shelter or access to other service for victims of trafficking should not always be conditional on their willingness to take part in criminal proceedings.  Often the victims of such trafficking are so traumatised and so afraid of the authorities and the trafficker and fear for their children or families at home that they will not be willing to engage in criminal proceedings against a trafficker.  What does one do in that case?  If somebody is so weak and so traumatised that they cannot go through that process, do we put them into the normal scheme of immigration and deport them?  That is an eventuality that is not provided for in this legalistic text of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  We are dealing with human beings here and considering what has happened to victims of trafficking, we need to be much more humane in our approach.  That is what we were looking for.  We have a Bill that has the support of the House but we are trying to ensure it is the best possible Bill and that we do not have to come back and add to it at a future date.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_137">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_284">What we are talking about here is the fundamental issue in the Bill.  We are trying to rely on victims to come forward to the Garda Síochána and then commit themselves to give evidence in potential prosecutions.  My amendment proposes that a temporary residency permit for a period of six months would be provided to the victim of trafficking and that it could be renewed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The reality is, and we articulated this on Committee Stage, that it would be virtually impossible for the Garda Síochána to take successful prosecutions unless proper protections are built into this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">It is fundamentally important that we provide assistance and protection to these persons in terms of housing, medical support, interpretation and legal services.  I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage specifically on the issue of legal services.  When the Minister responds I know he will say this matter is being taken care of in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  Deputy Rabbitte raised a fundamental point, namely, that the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill specifically deals with non-EEA nationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">If one looks through the list of amendments tabled by Deputy Rabbitte, many of these issues, even if there was provision for them in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which there is not, would exclude EEA nationals in regard to what are basic rights, if they continue to reside here and assist the Garda in taking successful prosecutions.  Those rights are the protection of private life of victims, appropriate medical assistance for victims, secure accommodation, translation and interpretation services, counselling and information services, legal aid, voluntary repatriation, family reunification, special protection for child victims, the right of access to training and education and the issue of compensation and access to social welfare benefits.  I put it to the Minister that if an EU citizen is residing here for less than two years, due to the habitual residency condition, he or she would not be eligible for social welfare benefits.  There are other social welfare benefits that are dependent on making a PRSI contribution and I doubt if many victims would be paying PRSI.  These individuals, who are citizens of the European Union, will be denied basic rights, not that any provision is being made for people outside the EU in regard to the specific issues in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  What we are being given is a pig in a poke.  We are told they will be given a reflection period and temporary residency but, other than that, we do not know with what they will be provided.  It is of fundamental importance that specific provision is laid out for these individuals.  To take, for example, the issues in regard to counselling, information services and medical assistance, will these be dependent on the HSE providing funds?  If Irish people cannot get access to this assistance at present, how victims of trafficking will do so unless it is enshrined in legislation defies comprehension.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">It is fundamentally important that we have successful convictions, which is what we all want — this is a key objective of every Member of the House, including the Minister and the Opposition.  However, we will not have successful convictions unless proper provisions are made for the victims of trafficking.  The last thing any victim should need to be concerned about is even a remote possibility of being deported from this country.  While we can tease this issue out when the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill comes before us, my interpretation of that Bill is that temporary residence beyond a period of 45 days will be dependent on those individuals assisting the Garda Síochána in attempting to take a prosecution.  As I said on Second Stage of this trafficking Bill, this is a dangerous avenue to go down because it will be used by defendants as a means to pour cold water on the evidence of a victim.  It will be suggested the only reason he or she is giving evidence is to ensure he or she is given residency in the State, temporary or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">It is critical that residency is not dependent on assisting the Garda with successful prosecutions.  In the vast majority of cases, these individuals have been abused by the traffickers bringing them in — who, in many cases, are Irish citizens or other EU nationals, and who act as pimps — and by Irish citizens availing of the so-called services.  There is an onus on us to ensure these individuals are given the proper protections, which should be enshrined in primary legislation or, at the least, secondary legislation.  It is of fundamental importance that this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">On Committee Stage, the Minister said he would respond to us on this issue.  He said he would, at a minimum, outline an administrative arrangement that would be put in place.  I hope he will respond to us in that manner because, at the least, it is required that this be put in place, even as a temporary measure until the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill is enacted and in force.  This Bill will be enacted with 30 days of an Uachtarán signing the Act into force, which will be a positive development.  However, there is not much point having the legislation in place without having the protections in place, if we are to ensure that people are prepared to come forward to give evidence, explain to the Garda exactly what is happening and ensure we get successful prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">When the Minister responds, I hope he will also deal with the issue of resources.  Making a statement to the House that A, B and C will be done is worthless without the resources being put in place.  I have provided an example with regard to the health service, and we spoke last night with the Minister's officials with regard to the treatment of child victims in the context of the immigration Bill and the health services.  This is particularly pertinent given the number of children who have entered this jurisdiction and been placed under the protection of the HSE by officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform only to literally evaporate into thin air.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">This is not an acceptable situation, even if the Minister gives a solemn commitment to the House that basic health services will be provided to the victims of trafficking.  The difficulty is that even if Professor Drumm of the HSE put this information on the record of the House, we could not believe the words coming out of his mouth given the commitments that have been made with regard to other services.  It is fundamentally important that we get an indication of ring-fenced resources that will be made available.  Firm commitments must be made on the protection and assistance that will be provided to victims in the interim period before the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The Minister suggested the immigration Bill would provide the protections that are missing from this Bill so the lack of detail is very disappointing, as is the failure to deal with the fundamental issues listed by Deputy Rabbitte in regard to his amendment, to which I referred on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  Unless specific provisions and commitments are made, and the necessary resources provided, we are all wasting our breath in bringing this Bill through the House.  Without those protections, we know we will not have successful prosecutions and until we have successful prosecutions that are not only publicised in this jurisdiction but throughout the EU and further afield, this practice will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">We can debate how prevalent trafficking is in this jurisdiction.  The reality is that it is happening on a daily basis in this State, to what extent we do not know.  We want to eradicate it once and for all.  The only way to do this is to ensure statutory protections and provisions are put in place with regard to the services provided to victims.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">The disadvantage of this is that while we are talking, I suspect the Minister has more or less made up his mind on this issue.  That said, it is important to put the arguments on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I am glad to see Deputy O'Rourke in the House.  When she was the Leader of the Seanad after two fairly explicit "Prime Time" programmes which exposed the darkness of human trafficking in Ireland, she was one of the politicians who promised legislation would be brought forward on behalf of the Government.  We now have that legislation.  It is a reflection of the goodwill on this side of the House in welcoming the legislation that there are only 20 amendments on Report Stage.  That is an indication that the Minister has got much of this right.  There are three broad areas for which we need to legislate: prosecution, prevention and protection of victims.  As regards prosecution, we needed definition and tough sentencing to provide the Garda Síochána and the courts with the required ammunition to deal with traffickers.  The Minister has done well and that is recognised across the board by people who have taken an interest in this legislation and have been lobbying for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">We will come to prevention shortly when dealing with forthcoming amendments.  We must target demand in a more effective way but I appreciate that we cannot deal entirely with the sex industry, including prostitution, in a concise piece of legislation such as this, which is specifically about human trafficking.  We can move to protect victims, however, because there are three categories involved in this crime: traffickers, users who provide the market, and victims.  This legislation should specifically target traffickers, which we do reasonably successfully, and victims.  On Committee Stage, the Minister said the debate was about criminal law rather than the broader issues of support and service provision for victims.  Deputy Naughten, however, made the correct link encouraging victims to come forward in order to facilitate prosecutions.  Gardaí cannot secure convictions without evidence and without people having the courage to come forward to tell their stories.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Trafficking is organised by ruthless, well-resourced, bright people who make money from intimidation and exploitation.  It is a world of fear for the victims involved because they are afraid of the consequences if they choose to speak out, and if they do not do as  they are told they get beaten up.  I could cite a number of examples of people of various ages who came to Ireland and were exploited and abused in the sex industry, but I do not think that would add to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">This Bill tells the victims, traffickers and other European countries that this is Ireland's legislative response to human trafficking.  We have dealt with certain issues very well but people will ask what we are doing for victims.  The response appears to be that we will deal with them in the immigration and residency Bill.  Much work has been done in the European Parliament to prevent human trafficking across the European Union but the MEPs concerned say the last thing we should be doing is blurring the barriers between illegal immigration and exploitation through human trafficking.  Victims of human trafficking should be treated as victims of sexual violence and exploitation in the same way as we would deal with a young Irish girl if she was exploited and violently abused.  Their nationality should be irrelevant because such people require the assistance of the State.  They should get it by right, rather than including such measures in an immigration and residency Bill.  As Deputy Rabbitte pointed out, many people are involved in human trafficking who have come here legally.  They came here expecting something but get something very different and are subsequently afraid to speak out.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">I welcome the fact the Minister has decided to legislate for temporary residency permits for victims of trafficking.  We are required to do so anyway by the European Union but it is a big step forward to include that provision in the immigration and residency Bill.  I think it is in the wrong place, however.  If we are going to deal with the matter in immigration legislation, why not do so in the Bill before us?  In that way the Bill would be all-encompassing in dealing with criminal law issues as well as the compassionate side by giving rights to victims.  It would be better to do that rather than having to revert to this issue at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">On Committee Stage, the Minister said he would examine ways in which he could deal with the interim period between the enactment of this Bill and the immigration and residency Bill.  He said we should try to put some measure in place for that interim period.  I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.  As it happens, I think the Labour and Sinn Féin amendments are slightly preferable to ours because they are more all-encompassing.  However, I do not really care which amendment is accepted because I want the Minister to address the principle involved.  I hope he realises this is not political point-scoring.  There are no votes in this matter one way or the other; it is an effort to try to produce as comprehensive a human trafficking Bill as possible.  I recognise that in this Bill it is difficult to deal with the demand side by including those using prostitutes because it would require a study in itself.  It is not difficult, however, to protect victims either when they come forward or when they are rescued.  It would be seen as a compassionate and just approach as well as the tough stance already contained in the Bill.  Even though I suspect the Minister already has his answer prepared, I hope he will be influenced by what other speakers have said.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_143">
          <from>Deputy Mary O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_305">To take up one of Deputy Coveney's points, this is not about point-scoring, lest anyone thinks it is.  On Second Stage I spoke at some length on this Bill, although I did not attend Committee Stage.  I am pleased to see the legislation approaching its Final Stages because it is long overdue.  The Minister and his Department have done well to bring it so far.  It is hugely important to protect the victims of human trafficking.  While all the strictures outlined in Deputy Rabbitte's amendment make for fine reading, perhaps it would be unduly prescriptive to include them such a Bill.  We are losing track of a central point of the Bill, which is not legislation based on equals.  Who can say that a victim is the same as a user or those who commit the crime of trafficking?  It is a David and Goliath situation in that the victim has a completely subordinate role because she is untried and untested in a strange country, she does not know the language and she has arrived with false aspirations and has had her dreams shattered.  She finds she must come forward to make a complaint to the Garda and tell everything but she cannot do so because she is in an inherently unfair and unjust position.  To expect such a person to acquit herself in reportage to the Garda or to apply for various social welfare benefits, a work permit or education and training, as proposed by Deputy Rabbitte, or to believe a woman in these circumstances could put herself forward to gain justice, humanity and kindness from the system that appertains in Ireland and that would happen <i>au naturel</i> is completely erroneous.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">I reiterate my special interest in this issue, as I did on Second Stage.  I am one of the vice-presidents of Ruhama and I would prefer to declare that rather than have somebody make a story out of my contribution on this legislation.  I am entirely committed to the measures the organisation has sought for many years.  Ruhama is unheralded and unsung and it was often the subject of ribaldry because people did not understand what it was most genuinely doing.  If the measures outlined in Deputy Rabbitte's amendment are thought to be unduly prescriptive to include in legislation, given Departments have an aversion to prescriptive legislation, would there be an opportunity for the Minister to include an omnibus recommendation in an administrative way, as proposed by Deputies Naughten and Coveney?  Apart from the validity attaching to this proposal because it has been mentioned in the House, it would also need to be underpinned by an administrative statutory arrangement, whereby the victim would have appropriate access to many of the resources the State would provide normally to the victims of such a depravity.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, myself and others on the joint committee would become duly and properly excited if a young Irish girl or a group of Irish women were being so exploited and we would demand, as would everybody else, an immediate response.  However, in the main, these young women are European citizens because they have travelled from some of the poorer countries, including the recent accession states.  We are committed to ensuring such citizens who are allowed to access our country should be looked after in all aspects.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, it took a long time for labour laws to catch up with what has been happening in the context of employment rights but they did.  However, these able bodied members of the working community are being preyed upon.  These young women find themselves defeated suffering from low morale in a strange country and unable to make demands because they do not have strong voices or the wherewithal in many aspects of their lives to put forward their case.  I seek a commitment to the general thrust of what Deputy Rabbitte has put forward in his amendments.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_144" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_308">As I explained in detail on Committee Stage, the Government has a comprehensive strategy to ensure Ireland will be in a position to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.  The legislation is an element of the strategy and is, therefore, not the entire strategy.  That is an important context in which our discussion should take place.  I welcome very much the contributions of Members on these amendments.  The convention obliges state parties to provide for the protection of victims and the provision of services to them and the Government is committed to putting a strategy in place to address the different issues mentioned by Deputy Coveney, including prosecution, prevention and protection.  The Bill is an important element of the strategy because it deals with the substantive offences being created and their prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Central to the policy underpinning this legislation is putting traffickers out of business and behind bars.  We must be careful in the legislation not to do anything that would allow them to escape justice.  We must always be careful in law about unintended consequences in statutory drafting.  An example of how well meaning statutory provisions aimed at supporting victims of trafficking can cause problems was given in the observations of the Human Rights Commission on the general scheme of the original Bill.  The commission, which is a statutory body, made a detailed submission.  My Department does not always listen to the commission but its observations on the provision of protective legislative measures in this substantive criminal statute are worth bearing in mind.  The commission stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_310">The provision of explicit rights for victims in a prosecutorial statute may potentially be characterised as an inducement to give evidence, thus possibly undermining the case for the prosecution.  Where certain rights and privileges are extended to victims conditional on co-operation with a police investigation and/or a prosecution, a plausible defence may be mounted to the effect that the victim has been incentivised to give evidence.  This may, in turn, diminish the impact of such evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Deputy Naughten rightly said what we want, on foot of this legislation, is successful convictions.  The Supreme Court has made judgments on what is an "inducement".  In the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v</i>. Gilligan, the court examined where evidence given by persons in the analogous position of being on a witness protection programme could be admitted.  The court ruled such evidence was admissible but struck a note of caution regarding evidence from such persons.  In the United States, where victims of trafficking avail of special visas permitting temporary residence while co-operating with police investigations, arguments have been mounted that the perpetrators have an improper incentive in the giving of evidence.  We must be careful not to put on the face of this legislation anything that could be construed as an open inducement in the context of the prosecution of these offences.  That consideration has weighed on me in the analysis of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Deputy Rabbitte found it incomprehensible that an element of protection was not written into the legislation.  However, that is a fundamental legal consideration to which I must have regard in the drafting of legislation.  It is clear great care must be taken when providing for residency rights of alleged victims of trafficking and the services provided to them while availing of those rights.  That is why the question of residency is being addressed in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008.  Similar care must be taken when providing for the different services referred to in the amendments tabled by Deputies Rabbitte and Ó Snodaigh.  I do not take issue with the tabling of the amendments because I understand the Deputies' motivation but the practical reality is that the form of their amendments would drive a coach and four through virtually the entire Statute Book, given the range of rights conferred in them.  However, the tabling of the amendments in that form was useful because it throws into relief the protections that should and must be available to the victims of trafficking.  Care will have to be taken when providing for these services.  It is no accident that administrative provision can be made to comply with the Council of Europe convention but we have to provide the services because if we fail in that respect we will not be able to ratify the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">As I indicated on Committee Stage, the Government established a high level group to devise the national action plan on trafficking.  The plan will be implemented by the relevant Departments and agencies, all of which are represented on the group at senior official level.  Deputies will recall that I also announced the establishment of an anti-trafficking unit within my Department exclusively dedicated to co-ordinating and facilitating the national strategy to address human trafficking.  A competition was held for the post of executive director of the unit and the successful candidate, Ms Marion Walsh, has been appointed.  Ms Walsh has made it clear that she will work with Government and non-government agencies to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for preventing trafficking, prosecuting traffickers and protecting victims.  That is her mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">With regard to immigration issues, it was asserted on Committee Stage that the Bill would be useless if alleged victims could not be assured of a period of reflection and recovery.  I agree that alleged victims should not have to await the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 to be assured of that Bill's reflection and recovery provisions so, having regard to the fact that the Bill has been published, I assure the House that administrative arrangements reflecting the relevant proposals in that Bill will be put in place to fill the gap between the coming into effect of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill and the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  These arrangements will allow a foreign national who is a suspected victim of trafficking to be afforded a period of recovery and reflection of 45 days and the possibility of obtaining a further period of temporary residence for six months, renewable as may be necessary to allow the person to assist the authorities in any investigation or prosecution arising.  For the purpose of identifying a victim of trafficking, a member of the Garda Síochána shall provide a statement to the Minister indicating that reasonable grounds exist for suspecting the person to be a victim.  A statement of those arrangements reflecting the provisions in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will be brought into effect and made available following enactment of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Deputy Rabbitte noted that the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill does not apply to EU nationals but such people do not require any visa or permission to reside in this State.  Residency has to be addressed as an issue for persons from outside the EU but legislating for a period of rest or reflection for an EU national would be contrary to our obligations on free movement within the EU.  Apart from the question of residency, which will be addressed on an administrative basis pending the enactment of the immigration legislation, the services to which Deputies Naughten and Rabbitte referred must also be provided.  The high level working group will have to work with the various Departments to determine the precise services that can be made available to victims of trafficking.  Deputy Rabbitte correctly pointed out that the numbers involved are not that large and the relevant arrangements can be made by the Departments.  However, in regard to the example of social welfare provision given by Deputy Naughten, Irish citizens who do not have stamps do not qualify for unemployment benefit or old-age pensions.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">These questions can be examined in the context of the Social Welfare Acts.  I accept the Deputy's point that the habitual residency qualification in the case of EU nationals may have to be examined in the context of a victim of trafficking.  The high level group can work with the Departments on the measures required to ensure proper protection.  We are committed to ratifying the Council of Europe convention, which obliges us to put this criminal legislation in place and to put in place prevention and protection strategies, so we are working through these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">I appreciate the concerns eloquently expressed by Deputies opposite but it is fair to ask that we are judged on the outcome of this holistic strategy which is intended to address all the elements of this issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_319">The House will be aware I am an admirer of the Minister but I have come to the view that barristers should not be let near the Office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and teachers should not be Ministers for Education and Science.  The Minister's stock in trade is the ability to argue any point on whichever side of the case he happens to stand.  In this instance, his worthy civil servants have burrowed away since Committee Stage to come up with a new argument for resisting this amendment.  Where else did they find their argument but in a comment by the Commissioner for Human Rights?  They now think the law of unintended consequences may apply and that aspects of my amendment could be read as a positive inducement to undermine the law.  One has only to give that argument to a Minister like Deputy Brian Lenihan and, by God, he will make the most of it.  Of course, one could equally give him the comments by the commissioner which support my amendment and he would convince us that the amendment is a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I do not accept his main point, which was not adduced on Committee Stage because we have only discovered it since then.  I cannot see how normalising the environment for a young person who has been exploited disgracefully could be seen as anything other than an incentive for co-operation in bringing a prosecution.  Law enforcement can only be effective if the environment is normalised and if a legally protected recovery period is available.  A young person brutalised in these circumstances needs a period of physical and psychological recovery.  I do not believe the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill is the place to provide that period, which should be provided for in the Bill before us.  Notwithstanding this legislation, it remains the case that the victim can be jailed or deported.  Will the Minister agree to give NGOs representation on the high level group?</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_321">The objective of this Bill is to put traffickers out of business.  However, by using the arguments of the Human Rights Commission, the Supreme Court judgment in the Gilligan case and the law of unintended consequences, the Minister contradicted what he said in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  The initial 45 days may not be dependent on assisting the Garda. However, in the six-month period and the six months subsequent to it we are dependent on people assisting the Garda.  I am sure the Minister will use a different argument when we deal with this matter in the context of the immigration legislation.  What he said is a fallacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The Minister referred to a comprehensive strategy.  However, we do not know the nature of that strategy and provision has not been made in respect of it.  We are aware that provision will be made for temporary residency in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  However, no such provision will be made in respect of protection.  No one will assist the Garda or provide evidence unless they are given protection.  Deputy Rabbitte's amendment makes provision in respect of protection.  A commitment has not been given to the effect that the said provision will be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The Minister stated that the conditions relating to habitual residency will have to be considered in the context of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  I could provide numerous examples of matters in respect of which his Department is supposed to be tick-tacking with the Department of Social and Family Affairs but with regard to which nothing is happening.  However, we will discuss that matter next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings will not, from a protection point of view, be complied with until the matters to which I refer have been addressed.  Neither this Bill nor the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill make statutory provision for these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">What is the timetable with regard to complying with the various elements of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings?  When will the Minister be in a position to inform the House that Ireland has fully complied with the Convention, including in the context of introducing protection measures?</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_326">I welcome the fact that we have not been presented with the entire strategy and that there is more to it.  The difficulty with the strategy is that it is a bit here, a bit there and a bit everywhere.  That is why we have continued to argue since Second Stage that protections for victims should be included in the Bill rather than elsewhere.  It would be preferable if the latter were done because we would not be obliged to rehearse these arguments when we deal, at some future date, with the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  I do not understand why protections are not included.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">EU Council Directive 2004/81/EC, which deals with some of these matters, was not signed by Ireland.  The deadline for signing this directive passed on 6 August.  The provisions therein might have dealt with some of our concerns, even though, as the Minister stated, they may have led to the creation of some inducements.  As stated earlier, however, the provision of shelter for victims should not be conditional on their willingness to give evidence.  It would not, therefore, be an inducement.  Our amendments are not seeking to create inducements, they are designed to put in place protections to ensure that people rebuild their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">If, during the period of reflection an individual decides to pursue, by means of prosecution, the person or persons responsible for his or her circumstances or the abuse he or she suffered, such a development would be welcome.  The State would obviously have easier access to someone who is in a safe shelter and being provided with counselling to allow him or her to deal with the enormity of what he or she would be taking on by going to court and detailing the abuse he or she suffered.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I urge the Minister to re-examine this matter.  I also urge him, even at this late stage, to try to ensure that protections beyond those contained in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill are included in this legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_330">I recall debating this matter approximately one year ago with a British Conservative MEP who made the point that we could not possibly legislate for temporary residency permits for victims of trafficking because there would be a queue of people willing to give evidence on the basis that their residency applications would be fast-tracked.  That argument is nonsensical and relates to the law of unintended consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The Minister stated that, on one hand, he is willing to put in place administrative arrangements to ensure that people can obtain temporary residency but that, on the other, he cannot deal with the matter in law because people might give evidence on the basis of obtaining such residency.  That is a complete contradiction.  If the Minister is legislating in respect of this matter and putting in place temporary measures to ensure that it will happen, why is it not possible to make provision in respect of it in the Bill?  If it is going to be dealt with in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, why is it not possible to make provision in respect of it in the Bill before us?  I do not understand why the matter cannot be dealt with in this legislation.  If we deal with it now, the Bill will, in the context of human trafficking, be much more comprehensive.</p>

Were we to make provision in respect of the matter under discussion in the Bill before us — this is altogether separate from the issue of inducements raised by the Human Rights Commission — we would be obliged to repeal and then re-enact it in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  The latter is a comprehensive codifying measure that deals with all aspects of the right to residence in Ireland and repeals all the relevant legislation going back to 1935.</p>

          <p eId="para_334">If I were to follow Deputy Coveney's advice, I would make provision in respect of the matter in question in this Bill and then be obliged to repeal that provision a few months hence when the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill is enacted.  The latter is the correct mechanism with which to deal with the matter because it deals with residency in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">To allay the concerns expressed by Deputy Rabbitte to the effect that persons might be under fear of deportation, I wish to state on the record of the House that I will, on an administrative basis, exercise my discretion as Minister in accordance with the proposed section in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill when the legislation before us comes into force.  The issue of residency is, therefore, settled.  We will have an opportunity to examine the precise provision in the context of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill to see whether further improvement can be made.  The question of residency does not arise for EU nationals because they have a right to reside here.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I made it clear that the high level group will work on all the protection issues as a matter of urgency.  The new director of the anti-trafficking unit is anxious to engage with the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, this month to discuss their concerns and discover how matters can be progressed.  Deputy Rabbitte asked if I would consider appointing a representative from the non-governmental side to the high level working group.  I will consider doing so.  However, I would like the director of the anti-trafficking unit to meet the representatives of all the NGOs which do so much work in this area to identify ways in which immediate progress can be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">In fairness to my officials, I should inform Deputy Rabbitte that they prepared a brief on the subject of inducement for my consideration before Committee Stage.  His entertaining vignette about officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform ransacking Human Rights Commission reports is not, therefore, accurate.  I was briefed before Committee Stage and I neglected to advise the Deputy of this argument during the relevant debate.  The Human Rights Commission stated that it is dangerous to put it on the face of a criminal statute.  However, it did not indicate that it is dangerous to include it in an immigration Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">I have two brief points.  There will be no statutory provision for protection in any legislation, aside from the issue of residency.  It is not contained in this legislation or the immigration legislation.  There will be no statutory provision whatever for victims of trafficking.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">The Minister's administrative proposal does not comply with the law of unintended consequences because it is dependent on assisting the Garda.

          <p eId="para_348">I welcome the commitments put on record by the Minister as they will be of some ease to organisations working at the coalface.  I reiterate the point made by Deputy Naughten that we will have no statutory provisions with regard to victims protection, and after this debate I am still at a loss in understanding why the amendment is being resisted.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I am prepared to take on board Deputy O'Rourke's comments that it is true Departments — not least the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform — do not particularly want to be landed with an overly-prescriptive charter of victim protection, as is the case here.  There are certain elements of such victim protection that are more important than others.  Why it would not be enshrined in a Bill concerning trafficking is beyond me.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">There is a world of difference between immigration and what we are discussing, cross-border international crime.  Immigration is a different issue as we are debating the trafficking of human beings, although not necessarily of our nationality.  They are mainly young girls being traversed across Europe into positions of exploitation, where pimps and international criminals are profiting from selling their services to users in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">All we are saying is the people being trafficked should be provided with a caring environment after they are rescued from the clutches of these pimps.  They should be allowed circumstances where they can psychologically and physically heal and recover from the experience.  I find it very difficult to understand how that in any way abrogates the criminal law designs of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">We are agreed that the measure being introduced by the Minister is important for all the reasons we have addressed.  Some of the commitments he made in reply are of some comfort to people interested in this debate outside of here.  The major defect in this legislation is that it does not itself encompass victim protection measures for the small number of people who find themselves being disgracefully exploited in our jurisdiction.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_355">In page 5, line 3, after "child," to insert the following:</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_357">(<i>c</i>) supplies or avails of the services of the child which the child has been trafficked to provide, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the child was trafficked,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">This relates to section 3 of the Bill, which provides for action against the trafficking of children in particular.  I seek for the avoidance of doubt to include this amendment, which would criminalise the person who supplies or avails of the services which the child has been trafficked to provide, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe the child was trafficked in the first place.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is necessary to criminalise the user in those circumstances where the user has reasonable grounds to believe the person was trafficked.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The Minister drew our attention to the fact on Committee Stage that there is a law dealing with the issue of sexual exploitation of a child under 17.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that in the definition section of the Bill, a child is defined as a person under the age of 18 years.  That is different.  The Minister's argument on Committee Stage was that it would deter the user co-operating in the implementation of the legislation or the prosecution or enforcement of the law.  The user would be deterred if he or she believed there may be liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Is there a single example in Irish case law where prosecution depended on the user coming forward?  Is it the expectation of the Minister that leaving it as it stands is likely to induce the user, in some circumstances, to come forward?  I greatly doubt it.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The other objection of the Minister is that it would be very difficult to prove if this requirement was put into the Bill.  I accept it would be difficult to prove in many cases but every case, as the Minister knows, is different.  There may well be cases where it would be possible to prove the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">In any event, a question arises which I thought Deputy O'Rourke was going to touch on.  With regard to our treatment of prostitution in this country, the act of prostitution does not create an offence on either side, although to solicit does.  There is no penalty attached to the user in any set of circumstances.  I am raising the relatively narrow area here of where the user has knowledge, or there are reasonable grounds to conclude the user had knowledge, that the person in question was trafficked.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">When I referred the Minister to the definitions section, I drew his attention to the fact that a child is defined as a person under 18 years.  We are discussing a person who trafficks a child for the purposes of exploitation.  Exploitation is also defined in the Bill.  Exploitation can be for labour or sex.  The focus of this debate has been such that we have forgotten about labour exploitation.  That is an added argument for my more elaborative amendment which ought therefore to be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The only difference between my amendments Nos. 4 and 15 is whether the person is a child or an adult.  I do not wish to delay the House on the issue later.  We ought to criminalise the user when a child has been trafficked to provide a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Deputy Coveney adverted to the wider debate on this subject but concluded that this statute is not the place for that debate.  He is probably right and we have a great deal more work to do before we are ready to discuss that issue.  People have presented arguments to me about similar legislation in Sweden which was enacted in 1999.  The statistics show that there has been a serious diminution in trafficking and prostitution there as a result.  Is it the male mindset that contributes to the view that we cannot discuss or deal effectively with this subject because no one has dealt with it since time immemorial and that if it could have been dealt with in a civilised way it would have been?  Does the Minister dispute the submission that the legislation has been effective in Sweden where there is no significant trafficking problem and prostitution is less prevalent than it was?  The purpose of my amendment is to avoid doubt and include the knowledge that the person has been trafficked.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_366">I am speaking to my amendment No. 14 but I also wish to address Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 4.  He has articulated well the apparent anomaly between the Minister's definitions in this legislation and those in other Acts.  It makes sense to clarify this and to accept amendment No. 4 because it is important to deal with protection of children.  It is appalling that 65 migrant children go missing from HSE accommodation annually, something we will debate at greater length on the immigration Bill.  This amendment, however, is reasonable and adds clarity to the Bill and I hope the Minister will accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">My amendment No. 14 is similar to Deputy Rabbitte's amendment but it deals with adults and people who benefit from the services of an individual who has been trafficked.  On Committee Stage the Minister said he was prepared to consider this issue before Report Stage.  I look forward to his response to the argument put forward there.  While the legislation is strong on the individuals trafficking persons, that is not so of those who avail of the services.  In most cases the person providing the service is a woman.  The person who solicits is guilty of a criminal offence but the user of the service is only liable for prosecution if the provider is a child.  We must deal with demand.  There will be no financial incentive for people to traffic individuals into, or abuse them in, the country if availing of the services is made illegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The Minister quoted the Council of Europe Convention in respect of a previous amendment.  Article 19 of the Convention provides for offences relating to persons who use the services of the victims of trafficking.  Such a provision in this Bill would be a strong deterrent and would act as a barrier to the proliferation of human trafficking into and through this jurisdiction.  It will be difficult to make a successful prosecution but if that were to be the criterion for inclusion in primary legislation many of our Acts would be slim because there are many provisions, some of which the Minister has listed, under which there have been no successful prosecutions.  That should not be the criterion.  As a parliament we must put down a marker that this practice is illegal, that we are going to deal with it and ensure that the people who avail of such services will be prosecuted.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The Minister also said on Committee Stage that there was no evidence that criminalising the purchase of sex reduces demand that it only displaces it.  Since the Swedes criminalised those who purchase sexual services there has been a dramatic decrease in trafficking.  The new Swedish law has also sent out a message that purchasing sexual services is not socially acceptable, and that has affected demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">There is a clear correlation between supply and demand in any market.  If the demand dries up supply is redundant.  Most societies regard drugs as harmful to individuals but prostitution is equally harmful and the daily work of non-governmental organisations shows that if we criminalise the activities of those who use the service it will have a direct effect on the availability of prostitutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Prostitution already is an underground activity in Ireland.  One need only consider some of the reports that have appeared in newspapers on the enormous expansion of the prostitution industry, particularly in the past ten years.  It has been effected through use of mobile telephones, the Internet, hotel rooms and there even has been an instance of a mobile brothel.  Criminalising users would act as a deterrent and also would have an impact on the possible expansion of this practice.  I do not agree that criminalisation simply would displace it or force it underground because it already operates underground.  Very little prostitution is blatantly open to the public eye at present, apart from in a number of specific locations.  However, it is of fundamental importance to lay down a clear marker on the issue of criminalising the use of the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I believe Fine Gael has tabled a fairly balanced amendment in this regard.  Members now have the opportunity to deal with this issue and I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_167">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_373">I will try to avoid repeating the comments of previous speakers except to state that I support amendments Nos. 4, 14 and 15.  This pertains to using the law to target demand and to inform people that using or paying for the sexual services of a trafficked person is a crime.  As legislators, Members should not rely on the moral conscience of the nation to deal with this issue.  A statement in law should be made to the effect that it is a crime to pay for sex with someone who has been trafficked and is being exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Any voluntary organisation that works with prostitutes such as Ruhama, which was mentioned earlier by Deputy O'Rourke, or the Sexual Violence Centre, Cork, formerly known as the Rape Crisis Centre, will confirm that increasing numbers of prostitutes in Ireland come from abroad and are becoming younger.  For example, I have been told that the average age of a foreign prostitute in Germany is 17.  The demand exists for young foreign women in Ireland and other European countries and the question arises as to how to deal with this problem.  Wherever demand exists, the product, which in this case is meat in the form of human beings, will be provided.  Whenever demand for a product exists, be it for drugs, people or arms, people will exploit it and make a great deal of money from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Consequently the demand side of the trade must be targeted, regardless of whether it is represented by a farmer, an accountant, a business man or even a politician.  These amendments pertain to sexual services because employment law and labour law is available to deal with those who exploit others in the labour force in locations such as mushroom farms or restaurant kitchens.  However, no law exists to deal with someone who avails of a person's sexual services.  It is a crime for an employer to bring someone from Ukraine to work on a mushroom farm, pay them nothing and intimidate them into working day after day.  However, it is not a crime to enter a brothel and knowingly pay for sex with a 17 year old or 19 year old.  Essentially, this is what the law states at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">While it is a crime to solicit, it is not a crime to take money or to pay money for sexual services.  The amendments under discussion do not propose to introduce criminal legislation for everyone who uses the services of a prostitute, which is an issue to which Members must return.  The amendments pertain specifically to trafficked people and circumstances when there is reason to assume a customer knows that he or she is using the services of a person who has been trafficked.  As Deputy Naughten observed, sometimes it will be difficult to prove and at other times not.  In the case of a 17 year old who cannot speak English, a reasonable assumption can be made that such a person has been brought to Ireland for certain reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The Minister should accept these amendments, which pertain specifically to people who have been trafficked, rather than to the laws on the sex industry in general, which also must be debated.  When one considers the increasing numbers of foreign girls — this issue primarily, although not exclusively, affects girls — in brothels and on the streets at present, this proposal would make an important statement to people that such activity is a crime and is not acceptable and is a legal, rather than a moral issue.  Such a statement from this House would be highly positive.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_168" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_378">First, I should have said in reply to Deputy Ó Snodaigh in respect of the previous amendments that the question of a person who is a non-EU national and who has been given a period of recovery and reflection in the State is not contingent on a prosecution taking place.  I have read into the record of the House and the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill states that the period of recovery and reflection is given for the purpose of assisting the investigation or prosecution of an offence.  Under the arrangement I intend to put in place on the enactment of this legislation and under the Bill when it is enacted, it will be possible for a person to get rest and reflection for the purpose of assisting an investigation.  For example, it will be possible to do so for assisting the Garda Síochána in getting leads that may not necessarily result in a prosecution.  It is important to put this on the record of the House.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised this issue under the last amendments and it also is relevant and material to the consideration of the amendments under discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">As for the amendments in hand, Members spoke on this issue at some length on Committee Stage.  I have given consideration to criminalising the activity envisaged in the first part of the amendment tabled by Deputy Naughten, that is, using the sexual services of a trafficked person, as well as in Deputy Rabbitte's amendments, which have a similar purpose.  This issue received serious consideration when the legislation was being prepared.  On the surface, the amendments appear reasonable but on closer scrutiny problems arise.  Whatever about creating an offence of having sex with a trafficked person, my concern is for the alleged victim and one must make a judgment on what is in his or her best interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The first problem with the proposed offence is that the prosecution would be obliged to prove the accused knew that the alleged victim had been trafficked and this would be almost impossible.  It is very difficult to see as a matter of proof how one could establish an offence, not only of purchasing sex but of purchasing sex from a person whom one knows to be a victim.  The establishment of such knowledge as a matter of proof would be extremely difficult.  I appreciate Deputy Coveney's point that Members have a function to make headline statements and that putting the proposed measure on the Statute Book would constitute such a statement.  While I appreciate the point of so doing, such a statement would be incapable of practical enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">A further issue in this regard is that when a prosecution takes place, it is likely that the Garda still will be investigating the alleged criminal offence of trafficking.  For example, Members should consider a case in which a victim is prepared to state that he or she told the person who purchased sex that he or she had been trafficked.  While such a statement undoubtedly would be controverted, one would have a case.  The book of evidence on this offence is far more easily compiled than that on the trafficker.  There is every practical possibility that the case of the purchaser of sex would proceed before that of the trafficker.  Any suggestion that a person had been prosecuted for knowingly having sex with a trafficked person could prejudice the case against the person accused of trafficking and make it more difficult to obtain the trafficking conviction.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The third issue, which I mentioned on Committee Stage, is that the user of the sexual services might be the best chance a victim has of escaping her ordeal.  It might be that if she pointed out that she was being trafficked to the person purchasing sex from her, she might be helped by that person.  It is unlikely he would help her if he knew he had committed an offence.  These are practical considerations.  In terms of legal policy, if one wants to provide for what is being suggested, one must criminalise the purchase of sex generally.  Deputy Rabbitte made a fair point and called for a debate on this subject.  It is worth debating.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Deputies Naughten and Rabbitte referred to the experience in Sweden.  It is worth examining the very fine research document prepared by Drs. Eilís Ward and Gillian Wylie entitled, The Nature and Extent of Trafficking of Women into Ireland for the Purposes of Sexual Exploitation: 2000-2006.  The authors state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_384">A report commissioned by the Norwegian government to examine the impact of differing approaches to the sex industry in Holland and Sweden concluded that in the case of Sweden [where the purchase of sex has been criminalised] the abolitionist approach to prostitution has reduced the number of women on the streets but may have had unintended consequences such as sending the industry further underground and thereby increasing women's vulnerability.  In addition, enforcement of prohibition has proved difficult and created evidential challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">This is in the context of a general prohibition of the purchase of sex, in respect of which the evidential burden is far lighter than that in respect of the offence of having sex with a person known to have been trafficked.  There are very substantial difficulties in this area and the criminalisation of the act of purchasing sex might not necessarily minimise sex trafficking.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">In 1993, when the offence of publicly soliciting for the purpose of prostitution was reintroduced to the Statute Book, there were calls to decriminalise the activity.  When the legislation became law, there was controversy over its effects on the lives and working conditions of prostitutes.  In retrospect, had we listened to those calls for decriminalisation, it would have been disastrous for prostitutes and, more latterly, for trafficked women.  We therefore need to be very careful in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Much has been written about the success, or otherwise, of the Swedish law that criminalises the purchase of sex and decriminalises its sale.  There are those who see it as the answer to the problem posed by prostitution but others take a more cautious approach.  Irish law is quite close to the Swedish model without criminalising transactions carried out in private by consenting adults.  It has been claimed that the number of street prostitutes in Sweden has halved since the law was changed and the Swedish Government has estimated that the number of prostitutes in Sweden has dropped from 2,500 to 1,500 since 1999.  However, these figures have been disputed by many, including a social anthropologist who has studied Swedish prostitution over the past decade.  The anthropologist states no one knows if there are fewer prostitutes.  This is not surprising because the law can only serve to drive prostitution further underground.  One former prostitute is quoted as saying that underground profiteers, pimps and traffickers flourish under the new laws and that prostitutes would naturally rather avoid such people.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The authorities in Sweden admit that trafficking has increased somewhat since 1999 but that the level is lower than in neighbouring countries.  It is very difficult to obtain hard evidence in this area.  Sweden's national rapporteur on trafficking has estimated that the number of prostitutes has more than doubled.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">It is clear that prostitutes in Sweden must now operate more secretly and therefore feel more vulnerable.  The purpose behind the law was to treat prostitutes as victims so it is ironic that the very persons the law seeks to protect do not want that law.  It is clear that demand does not disappear because of the introduction of a criminal law.  It is displaced and re-emerges on the Internet and mobile phones and in rented hotel rooms.  It re-emerges in neighbouring countries and regions such as south-east Asia.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The Swedish experiment is interesting and worthy of consideration but it is far from clear that it has been effective.  Its main advantage is that it reduces street prostitution, but, as Deputy Naughten pointed out, the development of mobile phone technology has had a great impact on the phenomenon of street prostitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I appreciate the Deputies' points but to create an offence of purchasing sex from a trafficked person would not lead to any successful prosecutions and might not necessarily help their victims.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_392">The Minister has broadened the debate on the argument that if we are to address this issue, we must address the purchase of sex <i>per se</i> and not just focus on an aspect of the problem, which is what the amendments do.  The amendments seek to make it a crime to pay for sex knowing that the person offering sex has been trafficked.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I have listened to the Minister and believe a number of people outside the House will be interested in reading his remarks.  He may well be correct.  I am not in any position to state the outcome of the experience in Sweden but have met somebody who works in this area in that country who advised me that the Swedish provision has been a considerable success and has diminished both trafficking and prostitution itself.  I am not sure where this matter is referred to in the report of Drs. Eilís Ward and Gillian Wylie, as mentioned by the Minister, but I have read their strong recommendation that measures to protect the victim be enshrined in the legislation.  I suppose the devil quotes scripture to his own advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I accept that it is not possible, in theory, to contradict the Minister when he states the user might help the victim in a particular circumstance.  It is possible but generally does not happen.  The purpose of my amendment is to avoid doubt.  If it were accepted, how would it undermine section 3?  The rest of the section would still be in vogue if it were accepted.  Its acceptance would address the question of demand, which we are not doing at all in the legislation as it stands.  We seem to accept the view that, human nature being what it is, there is very little point in our seeking to address the question of demand.  It is believed that doing so would be too complex and raise many issues and would only result in driving the phenomenon of prostitution underground and make matters more difficult for the women in the sex industry.  A great many people would question the correctness of that belief.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_395">I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that many people would argue against the point the Minister made in regard to the Swedish model.  I accept that these amendments are restrictive and do not deal with the broader issue, which is something we should fully debate in this House on another occasion.  I am not an expert in this area but it seems to me an incredible notion that a user would go into a brothel or bedroom, sit down on a corner of the bed, have an open and frank conversation with the victim of trafficking and then bring the latter to the local Garda station.  That will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">It is a question of putting down a clear marker that a person who avails of the services provided by a trafficked person is committing a criminal offence.  I agree it will be difficult to secure convictions.  However, it will also be difficult to convict a person of trafficking, especially in the absence of any statutory provision for protection, as I argued earlier.  One could argue that the legislation in its entirety will be difficult to enforce, but that is not a valid argument.  Just because something is difficult to enforce does not mean we should not outlaw it.  There are many laws that are difficult to enforce.  For example, it is impossible to enforce speeding laws in respect of motorists from outside this jurisdiction, but it is still against the law for a driver from Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom to exceed the speed limit in this State.  Should we go through the Statute Book and delete all legislation that is not easily enforceable in all circumstances?</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I ask the Minister to reconsider this proposal.  It sets down a strong marker and is representative of the opinion of this House in regard to those persons who avail of the sexual services of a person who has been trafficked.  It is important that we set down this marker.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_398">I am opposed to the amendments at this stage.  However, in view of the eloquence of the arguments put forward by Deputies Rabbitte and Naughten, I am willing to look at the narrow amendment proposed and to make that statement in the legislation.  I remain doubtful as to whether there will be successful prosecutions.  However, given the horrific character of the phenomenon of trafficking, I see no harm in providing for such an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">I would like time to reflect on the question of whether the inclusion of these proposals could mean a victim of trafficking is prejudiced in that a person availing of his or her services might be in a better position to offer assistance if he or she were not committing an offence.  However, I am open to the amendments.  It should be borne in mind that where sexual relations are with a person under the age of 17 years, that is in itself an offence.  The proposed offence, therefore, would apply in respect of persons over the age of 17.</p>

          <p eId="para_400">I welcome the Minister's comments although I am not sure what they mean in the context of where we are in the legislative process.  Like the Minister, I cannot see what harm it does to include these provisions.  To include them does not diminish the section, rather it sends out a strong signal.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I am reminded that John Mortimer is appearing in the Helix tonight.  He deals with this issue in the latest instalment of his <i>Rumpole of the Bailey</i> series, where a young man is faced with an ASBO because his playing football on a quiet street is objected to by a posh middle-class lady, a psychotherapist, who lives and receives her clients there.  It turns out, however, that it is not psychotherapy her clients are seeking.  The Minister says there will be difficulty in proving the offence of using the sexual services of a person who has been trafficked.  However, Deputy Naughten is absolutely right when he argues that it will be equally difficult to prove the offence of trafficking.  Whatever about the concerns of the Human Rights Commission, I would have thought it helpful if one could rely on the reasonable expectation that, once recovered, the person abused might give testimony to the fact that he or she was trafficked.  That seems to be a desirable situation.  If it is good enough for Rumpole of the Bailey, it is good enough for me.</p>

However, I am not prepared to go to the wire on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The point is that it is not sufficient to allow the law to stand such that a fine is considered adequate penalty for somebody guilty of trafficking.  The Minister pointed out the implications where a corporate body is involved.  My amendment No. 6 seeks to encompass this, and sufficient discretion is afforded to the court in the wording of the legislation.  The original wording in the Bill would probably be unconstitutional because it could be construed as providing for a mandatory life term for all offences.  Clearly, there would be difficulties with that.  In any event, the Minister has met the point and whichever way he wishes to go is acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">As drafted, the Bill allows the judge to do two things, namely, to fine or imprison somebody.  We believe the judge should be empowered to mandate reparations to the victim in the form of direct compensation from his or her trafficker.  This is important given the financial gain to the trafficker from abusing the victim.  It is also important given that some victims may not continue to reside in this State long enough to pursue civil proceedings for compensation.  If the trafficker is found guilty by the State under the current system, it would be open to the victims to pursue compensation in civil proceedings or some of the assets of the trafficker.  If the victim leaves the jurisdiction, which would be his or her right, to return home or to set up a life somewhere else, he or she may not be here long enough to pursue civil proceedings or may not understand that he or she can take this initiative.  There is also the cost of taking civil proceedings and everything that entails.  It is reasonable that, where appropriate, the judge can mandate the payment of compensation by the trafficker.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Today's headlines mentioned a forced labour case that the Migrant Rights Centre, which should be congratulated, took to a rights commissioner.  It ended up with the migrant worker being awarded €116,000.  The Migrant Rights Centre said this case contained all the elements of human trafficking for forced labour.  This man was brought to Ireland and made to work under extremely exploitative conditions.  He was controlled by the employer and threatened to the extent that he had no option but to tolerate the exploitation.  The case concerned a Dublin restaurant and I do not know why the restaurant or the restaurateur has not been named.  The Pakistani man was forced to work in appalling conditions for five years, earning only €150 per week, of which €100 was deducted by the employer for his accommodation.  He had no days off.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Siobhán O'Donoghue, director of the Migrant Rights Centre, said the victim was fortunate that he was still documented which meant that it could take the case and make it possible for him to seek justice.  She called for better protection for people trafficked for forced labour in the up and coming Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  Some of what we are dealing with here relates to labour exploitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">In this case, the person had the pleasure, if that is the right word, of seeing the person, who abused him, denied him the right to earn a proper living and held his passport, prosecuted.  He also gained compensation for the period of time he was held in such circumstances from the experience.  Ms O'Donoghue also states that if the Minister is serious about combating trafficking of people, he needs to acknowledge that trafficking for forced labour is a reality in this country and offer real protections to those in these circumstance because anything less is shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">It is in that context that the amendment has been tabled.  If people are so abused, the trauma will live with them forever.  They may not be able to pursue a normal life thereafter and overcome the trauma to set up a home, have a family or return to some type of work.  They would be at a disadvantage for the rest of their lives, with no hope of compensation.  At least compensation would give them some way to rebuild their lives and give them the security they deserve having gone through such a trauma.  I urge the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment seeks to give the court power to order the payment of compensation to the victims of trafficking, but such a general power already exists.  Section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 deals with the power of the court to order the offender to pay compensation to an injured party.  Under section 6, on conviction of a person for an offence, the court may make a compensation order requiring that person to pay compensation in respect of any personal injury or loss resulting from the offence "(or any other offence taken into consideration by the court in determining sentence) to any person" who has suffered such injury or loss.  This can be in addition to the court dealing with the offender in any other way.  The general power exists in the courts in the case of any offence, including the offences created by this legislation, to deal with an offender in the way the Deputy has advocated.  I am satisfied the existing law addresses that issue and that there is no need for these amendments.</p>

Whereas usually the judge deals with convictions, imprisonment and fines, the fine usually goes to the Exchequer while the victim often does not receive monetary compensation.

The effect of his amendment would be that a person could consent to being coerced, threatened or deceived into being trafficked.  There was a difficulty with that particular formula in terms of the international agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">However, the amendments on consent as raised by Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Naughten on Committee Stage did draw my attention to a provision in the international instruments, under which a consent given to the exploitation that arose from trafficking did not negate the fact that the person was trafficked.  It is arguable that this is implicit in the offence, but it is desirable to transpose it into our statute and to put it into the text of the Bill, especially since it is specifically provided for in the international instruments.  That is what I am doing in amendment No. 13.  I commend that amendment to the House and I thank the two Deputies for raising this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage.  The idea is that we do not want to criminalise the victim of trafficking.  In fact, with the proposed legislation on immigration, this compounds the problem I highlighted on Committee Stage.  I gave the example of the woman in Sligo who was a victim of trafficking and who ended up being transported to prison in Mountjoy.  She could have been liable to prosecution under the Immigration Acts for being illegally resident in the country and could subsequently have been deported from the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The Minister is now planning to get rid of deportation orders altogether in the new Bill.  The individual can now be deported straight away instead of being imprisoned for being illegally resident here.  That has made the situation even worse.  Whatever about my argument on Committee Stage, the Minister has strengthened my argument with the draft that he has put forward for the immigration Bill.  There is no flexibility in it once the person is resident in the country.  If somebody does not have knowledge of the English language or even a basic comprehension of the Bill, it is very hard for that person to inform a garda that he or she has been trafficked and to come under the protection to which the Minister referred earlier.  If the person is residing in the country and does not have proper papers, then that person can be automatically deported from this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">It is vital that people cannot be prosecuted for their presence in the country when they have been trafficked.  Such a protection should be put into this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_487">The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that a victim of an offence created by the Bill cannot be prosecuted for having entered the State or for carrying out the labour or sexual acts envisaged.  The Minister objected to these amendments on Committee Stage on grounds of admissibility of evidence.  We have sought to meet that objection, but the nub of the argument still applies.  Reference has been made by a number of Deputies to Ruhama and the work it has done in this area and with women in prostitution.  It is an admirable organisation which does very commendable work and it has been carefully following the enactment of this Bill.  It remains absolutely persuaded that the victim should not be prosecuted for offences committed as a result of trafficking.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">We talked earlier about the position on prosecution where an offence is not created on either side.  However, as I recall, there are three offences in this area, namely, soliciting, maintaining a brothel and living off immoral earnings.  Will the Minister say what the situation here would be if a woman was prosecuted for soliciting and it turned out she had been trafficked?  Is that a defence that can be adduced in these circumstances?  In the circumstances envisaged by Deputy Naughten, can we still have a situation where somebody can be deported as a result of being the victim of an offence created under this Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The general idea is that the victim should not be liable to prosecution.  He or she is the victim of gross exploitation, given the nature of this Bill.  What we are seeking to ensure is that the victim should not end up being prosecuted for being in the State.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to the type of labour exploitation that goes on in this State and which is encompassed in this Bill.  The definition of exploitation in this Bill does not just relate to sexual exploitation but also covers labour exploitation, including in domestic service.  How quickly we have become accustomed to domestic servants in certain parts of the country.  Whereas I have no objection to domestic servants being employed, it is appalling to hear that they are being exploited in some circumstances, required to work all the hours that God sends and being paid nothing near the national minimum wage.  That is an area of exploitation as well.  I certainly will find it very interesting to see whether there are any prosecutions under this Act, as proposed, in respect of the labour dimension.  In a way, it will be a test of how easy it will be to prove trafficking.  It may be that it is more equally shared here as between citizens of the European Union and those from outside the EEA area, but it is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I was in a restaurant recently where I could not help but overhear the conversation at an adjacent table between three very well-heeled ladies as they complained about their domestic servants.  I learned enough to know that I should contact the labour inspectorate to check out conditions.  Such is the way that we have changed in this country.  The argument being advanced to ensure the victim does not end up as the one being prosecuted is reasonable.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_491">As regards these amendments, the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974 established the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  Under section 2 of that Act, the holder of the office is independent in the performance of his or her functions.  That is a basic principle of our polity.  The functions of the DPP include all those capable of being performed relating to criminal matters, which of course includes the prosecution of offences.  The independence of the DPP is something we must cherish.  I do not believe it is appropriate to interfere with that independence, discretion or control in the prosecution of offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I understand the reasoning behind the amendments.  No person could defend the prosecution of victims of trafficking for offences concerned with the purpose for which they were trafficked.  However, in this area we have to rely on the Director of Public Prosecutions and on the discretion that office can exercise in this matter, which it is entrusted to exercise.  That, I suggest, is the way this matter should be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">In a sense the provision of section 124 of the immigration Bill is the substantive way in which the concern raised in these amendments has been addressed.  The provision of a path to residency for the victim of trafficking and for recovery and reflection in a sense addresses the concerns which motivated this amendment because within the context of the residency legislation a lawful residence is now envisaged for the victim of trafficking.  It would be unthinkable, then, that such a person could be prosecuted for entering the State illegally.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_494">The problem is that if the victim when picked up by the Garda Síochána does not inform the garda that he or she is a victim of trafficking, there is no protection for him or her.  The difficulty is that there has been a shift in the legislation proposed under the immigration Bill from the situation as it exists at present.  At the moment if someone is to be removed from the State, first the Garda must apply to the Department for a deportation order.  Then the notice of intention to deport is issued and a person has 14 days to respond before being deported.  However, we got rid of deportation orders so that whole procedure is gone.  The fact that someone is resident in the State without proper documentation means that he or she can be deported immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Take a man or woman in a very vulnerable situation, possibly in relation to labour employment, where he or she does not have the language or does not trust authority.  How will such a person admit to or explain to a member of the Garda Síochána that he or she has been trafficked.  In the meantime, the fact that he or she is already resident here means that he or she can be legally deported forthwith under the Minister's proposals in the legislation.  There is now a greater need for this protection to be built into this legislation than when it was being dealt with on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">That was the reason I posed the question to the Minister concerning what would happen in the case of a young woman prosecuted for soliciting — precisely the circumstances as envisaged by Deputy Naughten.  In other words, fear and intimidation go hand in hand with trafficking, where a young woman, fearful for her life and in the control and grasp of a criminal directing traffic and living off her earnings, is prosecuted for soliciting.  She may be in fear for her safety if she were to say, in effect "The reason I am doing it is that I left my home country in the belief that I was going to England or Ireland to work for a living and get a job, and I have ended up here through no fault of my own."  In those circumstances she may, indeed, be prosecuted.  Does it impinge on the freedom of the DPP to decide on what prosecution the office might or might not raise?  The DPP's office would know nothing of the circumstances here.  In other words, the local garda is prosecuting a young woman for soliciting and the case either proceeds or not on the basis of the file.  There may be no reference in it to the fact that the young woman has been trafficked.  I made reference at the outset to the fact that I got an unexpected number of e-mails and contacts from a recent television programme about this betraying, I think, that most law abiding people who live busy lives have not focused much on this issue.  They are quite shocked at the extent to which the problem has grown in recent years in the globalised world in which we live and especially where there is free movement from the new accession states and, indeed, free movement from Romania and Bulgaria, even if there is not a right to work here.  The problem is bigger than what we might think.  In those circumstances what would be the situation?</p>

          <p eId="para_499">Again, we are back to the discretion of the director.  I want to correct one impression conveyed by Deputy Rabbitte.  Of course, the file submitted by the Garda to the Director of Public Prosecutions would refer to trafficking if there was any suggestion of trafficking.  The difficulty Deputies Rabbitte and Naughten have, and the difficulty we have with this whole phenomenon, is the unwillingness of the victim to come forward.  The core provision is in section 124 of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill which provides for a period for recovery and reflection.  The person who recommends that to the Minister is a member of the Garda Síochána.  Clearly if there is the slightest suspicion of trafficking the Garda will investigate it and that will change the whole colour of any criminal proceeding that might be intended to be initiated against a victim.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">The Minister has missed the point I am making.  What I am talking about is something that goes nowhere near the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions whatsoever.  If an individual is residing in this State and does not have proper immigration papers he or she can be deported.  There is no such thing as a deportation order that is gone.  That person can be brought to Dublin Airport and immediately deported.  Does the Minister expect that a very vulnerable woman, or man as the case may be, who has been systematically abused, in the case of sexual trafficking, in more ways than any of us can comprehend, will volunteer to a member of the Garda Síochána that he or she has been trafficked, while travelling from Galway, Sligo or wherever to Dublin Airport?  That is what one is relying on in respect of what the Minister has just said.  The difficulty is that he or she should not be liable to breaches of being actually present in the State.  It is still a difficult issue to define and deal with but what is provided for in the legislation and being proposed in the next piece of legislation is that they do not have time to explain their case to any member because, once they are resident here, they can be deported forthwith.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Michael Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_509">The Minister, Deputy Martin, announced a public consultation on the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002 last October.  A number of submissions have been received and are currently being examined.  During a Dáil debate on the Private Members' Competition (Amendment) Bill in December, the Minister indicated that he would welcome submissions from interested parties.  I understand that a number of submissions were received in January and more are expected.</p>

            <p eId="para_511">The Minister of State might inform us what stage the Minister is at with regard to this matter.  It is customary for the Minister to advise us, or at least advise the Chair, if he is not going to be here to take questions.  As regards this specific question, will the Minister of State indicate how many Competition Authority reports have been published to date and how many recommendations have been implemented on foot of those reports?  Is the Minister considering including in the competition (amendment) Bill the proposal by the National Competitiveness Council and the Business Regulation Forum to require Ministers and Government agencies to offer a reasoned response to Competition Authority reports, which is the case in the UK and other jurisdictions?</p>

            <p eId="para_512">I do not have answers to those specific questions but I will obtain the details sought by the Deputy concerning the number of reports.  I will pass on to the Minister the Deputy's suggestion about replying to recommendations contained in such reports.</p>

            <p eId="para_513">I can give the Minister of State a rough idea and although we do not have all the answers we have managed to find some of them.  There have been 11 such reports to date, excluding those made last year which, in fairness, we do not expect to be implemented at this stage.  Going back to 1998, one out of four recommendations in the report on liquor licensing was adopted.  One out of ten recommendations in the report on casual trading was adopted.  Some 21 recommendations out of 42 were adopted from the report on non-life insurance.  Fifteen of 25 recommendations were adopted from the report on banking.  Six of 11 recommendations were adopted from the report on the architectural profession.  None of the five recommendations from the report on optometrists was adopted.  It is quite clear therefore that a Government quango is issuing reports on the lack of competition in certain sectors, while the Minister files them away and forgets about them, as he did when he was Minister for Health and Children.  There is a case for the NCC's recommendations to be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_514">What consideration has been given to making amendments to the Competition Act that would allow for contract negotiations between professional bodies, such as the IMO and the IPU, and Government agencies, as opposed to price fixing?</p>

            <p eId="para_515">The Minister has said that there will be a thorough analysis of all the submissions and that consideration will be given on how best to proceed when that review process has been completed.  It is too early at this stage to speculate on any possible legislative changes.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_518">I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_519">The total number of people recorded on the live register for January 2008 is 181,449.  The live register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">Unemployment is measured by the quarterly national household survey, collated and published by the Central Statistics Office.  The most recent quarterly national household survey, quarter 3, 2007, indicates that employment has increased by 67,600 in the year.  The unemployment rate is currently at 4.7%, down from 4.8% in the same period last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_521">The predictions for the medium term are for continued employment growth, albeit at a slower pace than that experienced to date.  Unemployment is forecast to average at around 5.5% over the period 2008-10.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">The manufacturing sector in Ireland has evolved noticeably since 2000, in terms of the composition of industry and the nature of activities, and is likely to continue to do so.  Manufacturing continues to be a significant employer accounting directly for 11% of total employment and a significant amount of associated services employment.  In order to sustain and grow the sector, the Irish-based manufacturing enterprises will have to continue the progression to high value-added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_523">Many of the job losses incurred in the past number of years were in low value-added manufacturing and these losses have been more than offset by jobs created in higher value-added manufacturing and the financial and international services sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_524">The Department, in conjunction with the enterprise development agencies, has taken a number of steps in recent years to identify and address issues affecting the manufacturing sectors, particularly through implementation of the enterprise action plan arising from the enterprise strategy group report and implementation of recommendations from the small business forum.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">As part of the commitments included under the partnership agreement Towards 2016, the Minister, Deputy Martin, established a high-level manufacturing group to review the challenges facing the manufacturing sector and to identify further measures to meet those challenges.  This group, comprised of industry, employee, Government and enterprise agency representatives, is currently in the process of finalising a report outlining its views and recommendations to ensure that manufacturing continues to play a major role in our economy and will report back to partnership early in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_526">For those who become unemployed, in any sector, the range of services provided by FÁS will be available.  This will include active engagement with persons on the live register with the objective of helping them to obtain jobs either directly or through further training, education or work experience.  It also includes access to the various training and employment programmes provided by FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">FÁS is also placing particular emphasis on the training of low skilled workers in vulnerable industries.  This is to ensure that in the event of becoming unemployed they will have the skills necessary to make the transition to other employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_528">The development agencies, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards will continue to promote job creation through the delivery of programmes to assist the enterprise sector to develop, thereby creating new jobs.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_222">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_529">The position is quite clear.  For almost a decade the Government has been sailing along, buoyed by the economic boom and thereby lulled into a false sense of security, smugness and complacency.  The Government has been given a free ride for almost a decade but it is now faced with significant economic turbulence.  The Government always claimed credit for everything that happened, with Ministers appearing on the news every evening.  Every news programme in the country was bombarded by them.  However, we have had 130 job losses at Grove Turkeys in Monaghan, 60 at Merriot Radiators in Clonmel, 360 at Allergan in Arklow, 220 at Jacobs-Fruitfield in Tallaght, 60 at Britvic in Cork, and 400 at the Burlington Hotel in Dublin, while 1,500 jobs are under threat at SR Technics in Dublin.  The litany of job losses goes on.  Is the Minister of State concerned that in January numbers on the live register increased for the fourth consecutive month?  One would have to go back to 1999 in order to find worse figures for January.  Was the Minister of State prepared for this?  Did he put all his eggs in the one basket, hoping the construction industry would carry employment forward?  Did he not anticipate that difficulties might well arise and were there no warning signs?  Many small business people, who are the risk-takers in this economy, are smothered and choked by the level of bureaucracy the Government has imposed upon them.  The Government is strangling the life out of small businesses but what will the Minister of State do about it?</p>
            <p eId="para_530">Yesterday, the owner of a business with ten employees appeared before the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  He complained that he had to fill in 54 different forms.  That sort of red tape is strangling small businesses that are the lifeblood of this economy generating jobs across the economic spectrum.  What will the Government do to help those industries?  The provision of foreign direct investment in parallel with support for small industries, which are important in every community, is needed.  What will the Minister of State do to ensure the obstacles and impediments to growth in those industries are removed so that they can expand and be competitive in this environment?  Is the imposition of a significant number of indirect stealth taxes on industry by the Government not one of its greatest problems?  Is it not responsible for the significant cost base of businesses, which is leading to a lack of competitiveness?  We are suffering the consequences of the Government's actions in imposing stealth taxes on companies and small business.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_531">I do not agree with the Deputy's contention that we have been smug and unaware of what was coming down the tracks.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance stated in his budget speech that estimated economic growth in 2007 would be approximately 4.7% and it would average 3.25% between 2008 and 2010.  He also stated the economy had reached a turning point and was entering a phase of much lower growth.  This is due to a combination of factors, including a weak dollar, weak sterling, interest rates and a slowdown in the housing market, which everybody acknowledges and which is having a significant impact on the economy.  The budget estimated employment growth at 3.5% in 2007, which equates to 72,000 jobs, but a reduction to more than 1% in 2008 or 28,000 jobs.  Employment increased between 2004 and 2007 by 247,300 and for the first time ever more than 2 million people are employed in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_532">However, we acknowledge there are problems and we must ensure competitiveness is protected and red tape is reduced.  We have plans to do so and I will go into this in more detail when I reply to a later question.  The Government accepts we are in a different scenario from a number of years ago but we are taking steps to ensure jobs are protected and continue to entice foreign direct investment, which has been good to this country over many years.</p>

            <p eId="para_535">I accept fully that the quarterly household survey is the most accurate measure of unemployment, but the live register is still significant.  It measures both unemployment and underemployment.  It is interesting that since the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment took office, the number on the live register has increased by 21,000 compared to a reduction of 100,000 when his predecessor, Deputy Mary Harney, held the portfolio.  By any reasonable benchmark, the Minister, Deputy Martin, has nothing of which to be proud.  I also accept the Minister of State's comments on the increase in employment but there has been a greater increase in unemployment, which is best measured by the standardised unemployment rate, SUR.  This has hit 4.9% and has increased by 0.5% since the Minister, Deputy Martin, took office.</p>
            <p eId="para_536">Is the Minister of State proud of his line manager's record, given the increases in the live register and the SUR and the poor comparison with his predecessor's performance?  Does he stand over the Government's budget projection that the SUR will increase to 5.4% this year?  Does he think that figure was underestimated and the number unemployed will be even higher than anticipated by the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance last December?</p>

            <p eId="para_537">For the past ten years I have listened to predictions of doom and gloom by Opposition colleagues, even though more than 2 million people are at work, the highest number in the history of the State.  I acknowledge there will be a downturn, mainly due to the correction in the house building industry.  However, 80,000 were employed in this industry and approximately 6,000 have been laid off.  Commercial property construction is holding up.  For example, a new power station is being built by the ESB in Whitegate in my constituency, which will employ more than 700 people.  Bord Gais is building a power station in Aghada, which is nearby, and it will employ another 450.  Workers leaving the house building industry will take up these jobs.  It will be interesting to see how people who have travelled to Ireland from other parts of Europe to work in the construction industry will react.  There is evidence of a reduction in the net number of immigrants in the past year and manufacturing industry is holding up.</p>

            <p eId="para_541">I agree with Deputy Penrose's suggestion regarding the inclusion of county managers and other development officers on trade missions, having been on many such trips in the past five years, and I will convey it to the Minister.  The roll-out of broadband has not been quick enough and it has been held up for reasons we all know.  However, moves have been afoot since before the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources took office to roll out the network so that we achieve parity in this regard with other member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is doing an excellent job promoting industry throughout the world.  He is not at fault for the change in the building industry.  Anybody who made predictions on housing output referred to a maximum of between 55,000 and 60,000 units to meet demand.  Housing output reached 90,000 units and it was logical that at some stage developers would hit the wall and they would have to pull back when supply exceeded demand.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_549">The strategy for science, technology and innovation, SSTI, which was published by the Government in July 2006 noted that, for a country whose performance is dominated by high technology industry, there is a disjuncture between an impressive performance overall and the level of research and development conducted by indigenous and multinational firms in Ireland.  The principal objective of the strategy is to address this imbalance by making Ireland internationally renowned for the excellence of its research and ensuring we will be at the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_550">Although growing from a low base, business expenditure on research and development, BERD, has improved considerably over the past decade.  It is encouraging to see that research and development expenditure in the business sector grew strongly in 2005 and 2006.  Research and development spending in the business sector rose by almost 10% from 2004 to 2005 and is estimated to have increased by a further 17.3% in 2006 to reach €1.56 billion.  BERD intensity as a percentage of GNP is also growing, from 0.97% in 2004 to 1.05% in 2006.  This reflects a robust research and development spending performance by both Irish and foreign owned firms.  Investment support in the area of research and development has been the subject of significant financial commitments under the strategy for science and technology.  This investment is already beginning to have a measurable impact, which should become more significant with enhanced investment.  The most recent survey of business sector performed research and development in 2006 shows BERD in Ireland is 1.05% of GNP, compared to the OECD average of 1.54%.  While Ireland lags behind competitors, bringing BERD in line with the OECD top performing partners is our goal.  It must be acknowledged, however, this is a significant challenge for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_552">In regard to Irish owned companies, the level of BERD has grown from €155 million in 1995 to €480 million in 2006.  Over the period 1995-2005, the number of indigenous firms active in research and development grew from 806 to 1,025.  Therefore, the trends of engagement by Irish owned companies in research and development are positive.  These trends can be directly attributed to the impact of Government policy to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_553">The current national development plan recognises the need for a step change increase in the investment in technology, innovation and scientific research and there is a firm commitment to a significant level of investment in this area over the lifetime of the plan.  The positive trends that can be identified to date are encouraging but we will remain focused on the challenges arising from the effort to improve competitiveness through innovation.  The SSTI sets ambitious targets for growth in BERD to €2.5 billion by 2013, two thirds of which should come from the business sector, and includes the following goals: the number of indigenous companies with meaningful research and development activity and annual expenditure exceeding €100,000 should increase from the 2003 level of 462 to 1,050 by 2013; and the number of indigenous companies performing significant research and development with annual expenditure exceeding €2 million should increase from the 2003 level of 21 to 100 by 2013.  The programme of investment in the NDP commits €8.2 billion in the period 2007-13 for building the skills needed for a modern knowledge based economy, strengthening Ireland's research base and driving research and innovation in enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">The 2008 Vote of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has provided over €326 million for the furtherance of these objectives, a 13% increase on the 2007 figure of €290 million.  In excess of €640 million was allocated to six Departments in 2007 for expenditure in the area of science, technology and innovation.  This funding will allow Ireland to continue to build its research base and improve competitiveness through the development of innovative products and at the same time build the knowledge base that will establish our economy as an attractive place in which to do business in a competitive climate.  This funding supports a wide range of specific policy actions aimed at ensuring business can significantly increase the level of research and development undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_555">Enterprise Ireland has a specific policy remit of supporting indigenous industry and in 2008 received a specific science, technology and innovation budget amounting to €132 million.  It is delivering a broad range of programmes aimed directly at increasing the level of participation by indigenous firms in research and development.  These schemes are under constant review to ensure they deliver on the ambitious goals of the SSTI.  Of particular note are the revised research and development grant offering, innovation vouchers and competence centres.  In January I launched the revised simplified research and development grant scheme to be operated by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  The new scheme will see these agencies invest more than €500 million in support of research and development.  The funding will be made available over the remainder of the Government's SSTI.  The scheme provides supports in a more client-focused way and is easier for firms to access.  The innovation voucher initiative, launched in March 2007, provides €5,000 vouchers to firms which may be used to purchase specialist innovation support from a number of research providers.  This is an imaginative effort to encourage small and medium sized enterprises to take their first steps in research and development.  By the end of 2007 a total of 428 vouchers had been issued.  It is anticipated there will be five calls under the scheme during 2008.  Competitiveness centres represent a major new initiative designed to create a number of industry led centres of excellence in research areas of key relevance to consortia of businesses with common research needs.  It is expected that the first centres will be established during 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">On a broader level, the fiscal environment for research and development investment has been significantly improved since the research and development tax credit was introduced in 2004.  The Finance Act 2007 enhanced the tax credit in a number of ways, in particular by fixing the base year at 2003 for seven years until 1 January 2010.  Budget 2008 went further than this and fixed the base year at 2003 for ten years until 2013.  These changes have moved the scheme in the direction of a volume-based credit and it should be noted that as the tax credit stands, expenditure on buildings is allowed on a volume basis.  This represents a significant support to firms undertaking research and development and should act as a real stimulus to activity in the research and development area.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">Taken collectively, these initiatives represent a significant and coherent set of policy initiatives designed to stimulate research and development in the business sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_558">The Forfás survey on business expenditure on research and development which was published in 2007 indicated that funding for firms with fewer than 50 employees had decreased between 2003 and 2005.  Have the barriers been identified for Irish firms investing in research and development and what measures are being introduced to overcome them?  Ireland is probably more reliant than our competitors on multinationals for employment and innovation, which makes us more exposed to the downturn in the US economy and challenges from Asia.  There is a low level of activity in research and development in Irish firms.</p>

            <p eId="para_559">As the take-up by indigenous companies has not been as high as we hoped over the past several years, new programmes have been introduced to increase the level of participation.  Enterprise Ireland has a number of programmes of particular relevance to research and development.  The programmes are aimed at stimulating research and innovation among companies which are new to product, process and service development activities.  These financial supports, which include research and development stimulation grants, allow companies to explore how research and innovation can drive their future development.</p>
            <p eId="para_560">The research and development fund supports innovation in services, products and process in companies which are ready to progress to larger projects.  Companies which want to set their own research agendas can apply to Enterprise Ireland's research and development fund, which supports market led innovation in manufacturing and services companies.  Companies can also get funding for collaborative research projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">In addition to financial supports, companies can avail of the guidance of a team of professional experts in building research projects, innovation management and creating value from intellectual property.</p>

            <p eId="para_567">I welcome the establishment of the Government's alcohol advisory group by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I understand this group invited public submissions on the following matters: the increase in the number of supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations with off-licences and the manner and conditions of sale of alcohol products in such outlets, including below unit cost selling and special promotions; the increase in the number of special exemption orders permitting longer opening hours which are being obtained by licensed premises around the country; and the use, adequacy and effectiveness of existing sanctions and penalties, particularly those directed towards combating excessive and under-age alcohol consumption.</p>

I asked for comment on the submission by the Competition Authority, about which I have grave concerns.  Does the Minister of State agree with the Competition Authority's recommendation to allow below cost selling of alcohol?  The dog on the street knows the abolition of the groceries order and the below cost selling of alcohol has increased binge drinking.  It encourages the purchase of slabs of beer and people have told me they double their consumption of alcohol in order to get a deal.  It is wrong of the Competition Authority to let ideology overrule common sense.  Will the Minister of State speak to the authority before it is too late?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_570">Reports in the media have suggested that the abolition of the groceries order has resulted in the wide availability of low-cost alcohol and an associated increase in consumption.  The order was abolished primarily because it allowed wholesalers and suppliers to determine minimum retail prices for consumers, thereby constraining price competition in the grocery trade.  It was not designed to address the issue of alcohol abuse and there is no evidence from studies to suggest it was capable of doing so.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">The high level development interdepartmental committee established to examine the recommendation made by the consumer strategy group considered the issue of alcohol and its report contained a number of recommendations including the abolition of the limit on the number of pub licences, the introduction of new forms of licence designed to cater for changing consumer tastes and the interpretation of retail planning guidelines in a manner promoting competition.  This is consistent across local authorities, with the result that planning regulations are not used as a barrier to entry in respect of pub and other licences.</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
            <p eId="para_573">I might get a reply to my question when the Minister, Deputy Martin, returns from Dundalk.  I understand the groceries order was not intended to cover alcohol but the Minister received advice to the effect that it might have a negative effect on the promotion of alcohol.  The Minister's agency is claiming it is not an issue but that is not the case.  This matter must be given careful consideration.  The Minister has taken responsibility in respect of other issues, so I hope he will not let us down in respect of this one.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">The report of the Competition Authority recommends that we should increase the tax and excise duty on alcohol.  I do not agree with it in this regard.  Below-cost selling encourages the promotion of alcohol, which is wrong.  However, increasing the tax will hurt everyone, moderate as well as binge drinkers.  I would like, at some stage, to hear the Minister's opinion on this matter.  I would not want to be associated with a Department that wants to penalise everyone — people who drink in moderation and those who binge drink.  The Competition Authority stated in the introduction to its report that it does not want to see the introduction of mechanisms that will penalise all drinkers.  As already stated, however, in its recommendations it advocates an increase in the tax on alcohol.  That is strange.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_577">The life sciences sector in Ireland comprises approximately 400 enterprises, employing more than 40,000 people, and accounts for almost €43 billion in exports per annum.  The industry is made up of a host of leading Irish and international firms.  Ireland has been extremely successful in attracting investment from leading international life sciences enterprises.  The majority of overseas operations based in Ireland are engaged in manufacturing activities, although a number of them have also established higher-value activities — such as research and development, supply chain management and international financial management — here in recent years.  Ireland is home to 15 of the world's top 25 medical technologies companies, nine of the top ten global pharmaceutical corporations and three of the top ten biotechnology corporations.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">As regards overseas investment, IDA Ireland completed its strategy review for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sectors in June 2007.  The strategy aims to develop an integrated pharma-biopharma cluster through attracting investments in both the earlier and downstream segments of the value chain, relative to the manufacturing segment, where most of the existing IDA Ireland client base is focused.  Specifically, IDA Ireland will be focused on attracting both top tier and emerging pharma and biopharma companies engaged in research and development, process development and clinical trials.  The agency will also focus on companies in development and manufacturing, together with those in downstream segments such as marketing and regulatory affairs.  In addition, IDA Ireland will focus on embedding existing companies by increasing their strategic competencies in Ireland and expanding the level of high value activities undertaken here.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">From an indigenous point of view, the Irish life science sector is, for the most part, characterised by a large number of small and medium sized enterprises, the vast majority of which have yet to achieve international scale.  Indigenous enterprises are engaged in a wide range of niche sectors within the life sciences industry.  The strengths of the indigenous life science sector are in diagnostics, pharmaceutical manufacturing, functional foods, speciality biopharma — such as drug development — medical devices sub-supply and information technology for life sciences.  Enterprise Ireland's strategy for the life sciences sector is focused on sustaining export growth, continuing to develop new high-growth potential start-ups and supporting established enterprises in achieving international scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">From an overall point of view, Forfás and the enterprise agencies maintain a high level of focus on this key, high-value sector of the economy.  Forfás, with the enterprise agencies, is currently researching a report on the life sciences ecosystem in Ireland, which will identify and inform responses to the sector's developmental requirements here.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">Forfás maintains a close involvement with various industry associations and stakeholders to ensure a constant awareness of the industry's immediate needs is maintained.  The expert group on future skills needs recently produced a report on skills needs in the medical devices sector.  This important document will serve to identify the skills this key sub-sector of the life sciences sector will demand in Ireland over the medium to long term.  It will also be a useful tool for education and training providers in their efforts to provide courses which will meet those demands.</p>
            <p eId="para_583">The measures outlined, which are illustrative of a co-ordinated response by the enterprise agencies to the requirements of the life sciences sector, will contribute to ensuring that this sector remains a key employer in Ireland into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_584">The expert group on future skills needs issued a report on the skills that will be needed in the medical services sector.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment was addressed by Mr. Dorgan before he retired, who indicated that the attention of IDA Ireland is focused on this area.  Ireland can create a great deal of investment from industries involved in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">The expert group's report contains many recommendations.  The first of these relates to the establishment of a centre for medical device manufacturing excellence in the higher education system.  However, the recommendation on which I wish to concentrate is that which refers to the need to upskill existing operators.  The expert group states that the need for low-skilled operators is on the decline and that there will be a need to upskill these individuals to meet projected demands.</p>

That report will be forthcoming in the not too distant future.  The Minister of State's work will address the points raised by the Deputy.

         the steps he is taking to meet the target of upskilling 500,000 people as laid out in the national skills strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_598">The target of upskilling 500,000 people as laid out in the national skills strategy is a very ambitious target.  To achieve this target and realise the vision contained in the national skills strategy will require an integrated approach — led jointly by my Department and the Department of Education and Science — that will successfully involve all of the key agencies in the education and training sectors.  That is why an interdepartmental implementation committee comprised of the Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, Deputy Haughey, and the Secretaries General of my Department and the Department of Education and Science will be established in the near future.  This committee will approve an implementation plan and oversee progress in respect of the implementation of the national skills strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">The expert group on future skills needs has been charged with reporting annually on the progress in implementing the strategy.  In addition, the Minister asked it to examine the potential of a number of innovative measures to incentivise both employers and employees to engage more fully in education and training.  The measures under review include paid learning leave, individual learning accounts for employees and brokerage services to help firms identify training needs and source suitable training and the potential of regional advisory groups.  The expert group's findings in these areas will be considered in the context of developing the implementation plan of the national skills strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">This year, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment invest €77 million specifically in training those in employment.  This is in addition to the amount that is invested in the apprenticeship systems.  The investment to which I refer, representing an increase of €7 million on the 2007 figure, will be used to continue to deliver training to those in employment, with a particular focus on the low skilled in accordance with the objectives in the national skills strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_601">There is no need to argue about the need for upskilling.  Many of the jobs that were lost in recent times were low skilled in nature.  The best thing we can do for the people who lost those jobs and those who will lose similar jobs is to deliver on the national skills strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">I understand that the aim is to upskill 500,000 people by one qualification people in the next 12 to 13 years.  How many of these individuals will be upskilled to that degree this year?  The Minister referred to the money that will be invested in upskilling.  I was of the view that the bulk of this will go to FÁS and the Skillnets.  I contacted FÁS earlier this week and was informed that it will only be able to upskill 30,000 people this year under the One-Step-Up initiative.  However, these individuals will not be upskilled by one level.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">They may be upskilled by a module, a subdivision of one level.  Is the Minister of State happy with that?  How many of the 500,000 will be upskilled by one level this year and how will that be done?</p>

            <p eId="para_604">It is important that there is recognition by all interested parties of an absolute need to upskill the workforce.  That is the reason there is a commitment in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 of €7.7 billion to carry out the process.  This will happen incrementally through the agencies with the remit for the work.  We have evidence of people losing jobs so It is vitally important the upskilling process trains such people in a way that they can apply to existing industries for alternative employment.</p>

In the context of the importance of the manufacturing sector, particularly upskilling, is FÁS the only agency that will be used?  As Deputy Varadkar noted, how will we meet targets if FÁS is constrained by a curtailment of numbers because of the public sector recruitment embargo?</p>
            <p eId="para_606">There is no argument that increasing the numbers being upskilled is vital.  How will the objectives pan out?  How will the €7.7 billion be spent and what agencies will be involved?  Is it not time to show some ingenuity, innovation and initiative in this regard to ensure the targets for upskilling, which are fundamental to our long-term well-being, are met?  FÁS should be given a wider remit and beefed up so targets can be achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_608">The Deputy asked who will implement this.  A group will bring together the Department's key stakeholders in the provision of training, such as FÁS, the important Skillnets, Enterprise Ireland and county enterprise boards.  That group is examining a variety of issues, such as the need to increase focus on the provision of training to the low-skilled, accreditation issues, the flexible delivery of training, the recognition of prior learning and capacity issues.

            <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_614">In March 2007, the European Council agreed:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_615">administrative burdens arising from EU legislation should be reduced by 25% by 2012.  Taking into account the different starting points and traditions, the European Council invites member states to set their own national targets of comparable ambition within their spheres of competence by 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">Prior to the spring European Council, the Government agreed that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should lead the cross-departmental and agency drive and put in place a mechanism under the Secretary General of his Department to drive this agenda at national level.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">As part of this effort, the Minister established the high level group on business regulation under the chairmanship of the Secretary General of the Department.  That group comprises representatives of Departments and agencies, the business sector and a representative of ICTU.  In its work to date, the group has been examining concrete measures to reduce the administrative burdens in five policy areas — taxation; statistics; environment; health and safety; and employment and company law — which are considered to impose the highest burdens on business.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">I expect the high level group will submit its initial report by July 2008.  Before setting a definitive national target in response to the European Council invitation, the Minister is consulting Government colleagues on what processes might be needed to assess the extent of administrative burdens on Irish business and on the measures that have been undertaken or are planned to reduce that burden.</p>

I have the good fortune to have the Official Report before me and I can see I specifically asked the Minister on several occasions when we would be given a target.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">A number of European countries have had targets for some time, including Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and even Italy.  I asked the Minister about this several times and he told me it would happen within the next two months, which left a deadline of 28 January.  Can I confirm that the Minister has reneged on his commitment to set a target as it has not yet been set?</p>

            <p eId="para_621">I was involved in the reduction of administrative burden in the last Government when I was Minister of State responsible for company law.  Deputies have mentioned regulatory burden and we brought in audit exemption, which has been of great benefit to companies and accountants.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">There are other areas in which changes have been made, leading to much angst being eliminated.  These include redundancy payments as the process by which companies reclaim payments made to redundant workers have been streamlined.  Claims can now be made on-line and there are savings of approximately €1.2 million for firms through this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">There is also the area of tax clearance certificates.  Instead of having to submit an original certificate in hard copy, the certificate can now be checked on-line by the Government agency awarding the contract.  That is another simple change which has been beneficial to companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has introduced new regulations whereby waste collection firms can apply to one local authority for a permit which will apply in other local authority areas.  These are areas in which progress has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">An ESRI survey was carried out in 2006 and 2007 of 800 firms on their attitudes to regulation and 55% of those surveyed believed the overall amount of regulation in their sector was about right.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">With regard to issues affecting international competitiveness, businesses ranked regulatory burdens at 14%, labour costs at 30% and infrastructural deficits at 13%.  We are ranked in the World Bank's Doing Business 2008 report at number eight from 178 in terms of ease of starting and running a business.  Aside from that, I hope the Minister will provide the target in the not too distant future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_627">I have a particular interest in this area as well.  Our committee set up a red tape index to measure bureaucracy in business.  Is the Minister of State aware of the legislation and regulations small business owners are forced to read, understand and implement?  There are almost 1,000 different major legislative items that affect the business.  These include taxation, industrial relations and health and safety.  It is an incredible amount.  I realise some are important so I will not deviate from the topic.  We should see if we can all achieve something.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">Will the Minister of State request each Department to carry out a full audit of legislation under its remit on the cost burden of business against the benefits of legislation?  From such an assessment a decision can be made as to how regulations can be streamlined.  ISME has advocated the standard cost model, which is used in many jurisdictions, as the preferred option for this process.  Would it not also be essential that a central co-ordinating body with relevant powers be given the necessary role to carry out this process, under a single ministry within a given time frame, and which would specify targets on administrative burden reduction within each Department?  Will the Minister of State consider the introduction of regulation impact assessments which should be put included in all legislation and regulations imposed on small business?  This would include formal assessments to be carried out, based on merited exemptions for small businesses pertaining to this legislation.  A small business, such as a shop with ten employees, has to complete 50 forms, including some for the Central Statistics Office, and there are criminal sanctions for those who do not comply.  It is time to get our house in order.  We must try to ensure that small businesses, which are the bedrock of this economy, do not have to carry the burden of all that red tape and bureaucracy.</p>

There is obviously nothing happening.  Nobody is being upskilled, a commitment to set a target for regulation is broken and the Minister is not here to explain why.  I would be terrified to be running a business, with the level of inertia, disinterest and the lack of concern from the Minister of State.</p>

As a result, Ireland's ranking improved to 21st out of the 32 benchmarked countries in June 2007, compared to ranking 24th in June 2006. However, the broadband penetration rate in Ireland at 15.4 % still lags the OECD average of 18.8 %.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_644">Ireland compares well on prices for 34 Mbit/s leased lines [. . .] but is relatively expensive for other broadband speeds.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_645">The key issue from a business development perspective is the limited range and speed of broadband services available and their comparatively higher cost.  The fastest speed that is widely available in Ireland (6 Mbit/s), costs four to five times more than considerably higher speed services in countries such as France, Germany and Hungary.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">This must change.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">Local loop unbundling, LLU, for current broadband needs and next generation experts for future requirements are the dominant issues for broadband in Ireland.  According to ComReg:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_648">Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) is a key wholesale product in telecommunications which provides the ability for non incumbent operators to provide new and innovative broadband products.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">LLU is a process whereby a new entrant or alternative authorised telecommunications operator takes control of a copper cable from a local exchange to a customer premises in return for rental payments to Eircom for the purposes of providing telephone, broadband or other value added services.</p>

            <p eId="para_650">The initial roll-out of broadband coverage here was a pure cock-up.  The big boys who got involved wanted only to give coverage to the major towns.  The rural areas meant nothing.  Residents of areas such as Westmeath and Longford create the highest demand for broadband.  Is it not important to tackle this fundamental infrastructure deficit to benefit industries such as telecottaging, which comprise five or six jobs that are essential to sustain rural areas as well as being environmentally important?  We must ensure that every citizen is treated equally in regard to broadband roll-out and that not just those living in vast urban areas benefit from it.</p>

            <p eId="para_651">I agree.  It is a disgrace that broadband has not been developed.  Last December, the Minister met with John McElligott, managing director of eBay, who had written to outline his concern at the pace of roll-out of high speed internet access.  The Minister agreed with him and described the Government's actions in promoting broadband, including demands and further proposals for next generation networks.  He said that the enterprise advisory group raised the issue of State investment in this infrastructure which the Government had to consider.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources asked Mr. McElligott for his views on next generation networks.  Mr. McElligott said he intended to discuss matters further with the Minister.  The Minister is well aware of the views of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on communications infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">In respect of next generation broadband, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is finalising a policy paper on the optimum role of the Government in its development, which is vital to ensure a state-of-the-art communications network.

            <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_655">To respond to the changing circumstances in the construction sector, the FÁS board established a subgroup last year to look at the impact of FÁS construction programmes on the changes in employment trends in the construction sector.  The subgroup has been examining this issue as a matter of priority and is in the process of completing detailed research at present.  It is expected the subgroup shortly will present its interim report with recommendations to the FÁS board.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">New house construction is a labour-intensive sector and the latest data show some decline in the level of employment in the construction sector during the second half of last year.  For the year as a whole, Ireland's unemployment rate averaged 4.5% as had been forecast.  Approximately 48,000 houses will be built in 2008.  However in the longer term, forecasts suggest a continued strong need for building craftspersons.  Forecasts published by FÁS in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute in August last year predicted that 90,000 to 100,000 skilled building workers would be employed in 2012, compared to a total of 85,000 in 2005.  The subgroup also has consulted widely, both internally and externally, including such bodies as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Construction Industry Federation and the institutes of technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">The number of new apprentices recruited into the building industry declined in 2007.  However in the longer term, forecasts suggest a continued strong need for building craftspersons.  The subgroup is of the opinion that any downturn in apprenticeship registrations should open up opportunities to improve the skills of existing craftspeople and low-skilled construction workers in other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">At present FÁS, through its employment services, also is engaged in identifying any redundant craftspeople and apprentices and providing focused supports to them.  FÁS also is in discussion with the CIF to identify possible courses for redundant craftspersons in the so-called wet trades, such as for example, listed building restoration skills, stoneworking etc.  Moreover, there is active engagement with the unemployed after three months on the live register to assist them make progress towards employment, training or active labour market programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">The normal full range of FÁS services of course also is available.  In the delivery of such services, FÁS liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the city and county enterprise boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  FÁS also works closely with the agencies to identify and support individuals who wish to start their own businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">Over the period of the National Development Plan 2007-2013, the Government will invest €7.7 billion in public funds to support training and skills development.  This is a significant increase when compared with the level of spending over the previous seven-year period.  The current level of investment reflects the importance the Government attaches to maintaining an educated, skilled and adaptable workforce in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">The Government also is committed to implementing the national skills strategy and soon will initiate an implementation process.</p>

            <p eId="para_662">Earlier in the debate, the Minister of State referred to the long-anticipated downturn in construction activity as a correction.  As someone who probably will enter negative equity by next summer, it feels like somewhat more than a correction to me, as well as to many people of my generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">FÁS has 28,500 apprentices at present, 90% of whom are being trained for construction jobs.  As the Minister of State has noted, the downturn in construction was anticipated.  In such circumstances, would it not have been appropriate for FÁS to have begun to shift away much sooner from construction apprenticeships to other areas in which skill gaps exist, such as HGV drivers etc.?  Would it not have been appropriate for the Department to offer FÁS advice to that effect?</p>
            <p eId="para_664">Most importantly, quite a number of these apprentices will probably lose their jobs halfway through their training.  What measures will be put in place to ensure that those affected either have the opportunity to undergo alternative training or can somehow complete their training, even if a job is not available to them at the time?</p>

            <p eId="para_667">I refer even to those who bought a couple of years ago.  Perhaps Dublin is slightly different but this is not the case in the rest of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">As for FÁS, the number of new apprentices in 2006 was 7,681 while the corresponding figure for 2007 was 6,288, or approximately 1,400 to 1,500 fewer apprentices.  However, craftspeople will be needed in the years ahead and it is predicted that in a few years' time, in 2012, 90,000 to 100,000 skilled building workers will be needed.  There are 85,000 such workers at present.  Consequently, if we do not continue to train apprentices we will lack the required number of skilled personnel in the years ahead.</p>

         the steps that were taken to promote employment rights, obligations and entitlements to employers and employees and to workers from overseas in 2007.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_674">The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, was established in 2007 on an interim basis on foot of a commitment in the most recent social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  NERA will be established on a statutory basis following enactment of the employment law compliance Bill, which will be published shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">NERA's mission is to achieve a national culture of employment rights compliance.  One of the ways in which NERA aims to achieve this mission is by providing information on employment rights and obligations to employees and employers in a factual and impartial manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">In 2007, NERA's information services provided this information to employees and employers through a number of channels, including by telephone, in writing, by e-mail, via its website and through ongoing public awareness programmes, including making presentations at seminars and events and hosting stands at relevant exhibitions.  In 2007, NERA's information services dealt with almost 100,000 contacts and made more than 40 presentations to a number of stakeholder organisations.  The unit also provided a comprehensive range of explanatory leaflets and guides on different obligations and entitlements under employment rights legislation.  These were available in English and a range of languages on the Department's website.  Throughout 2007, the direct contact information service at 1890 808090 was available between 9.30 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  Unbroken service was maintained throughout, including during NERA's decentralisation to Carlow in July.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">NERA is committed to ensuring that workers from overseas have access to employment rights information.  In 2007, NERA made its information brochure available in 12 languages including Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian, Chinese and French.  During 2007, NERA also liaised closely with a number of organisations such as the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland, Emigrant Advice and the citizens information centres nationwide network, which deal directly and closely with migrant workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">NERA participated in 11 exhibitions in 2007, including the New Communities Expo held in the RDS in October at which the largest attendance was from the Polish community.  NERA also took part in a FÁS-EURES event in Torun, Poland in November.  The aim of the event was to inform and advise the public in Poland on issues related to living and working in Ireland, as well as to assist Irish employers to recruit skilled employees from Poland.  It is estimated that approximately 800 people attended the NERA stand at that event.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">NERA is committed to providing impartial information to employers on their employment rights obligations.  In 2007, NERA staff participated in a roadshow organised by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, for its members.  The roadshow and NERA staff visited 12 venues over a two-week period.  Members of NERA's inspection services accompanied information officers during the roadshow.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">NERA inspection services play an important role in promoting employment rights during the course of their inspection activity.  As part of the inspection process, inspectors, where appropriate, inform employers of their obligations and employees of their rights.  The need for inspectors with specific language skills to ensure that an effective customer service is provided to migrant workers was identified in 2007.  As a result ten inspectors with specific language skills were recruited through the Public Appointments Service.  Three of these inspectors have taken up their positions with NERA to date and are undergoing training at present.  The remaining inspectors are expected to take up their positions in the coming weeks.  One of NERA's most important information and awareness tools is its website, <i>www.employmentrights.ie</i>.  I encourage all Deputies to look at it because it is exceptionally good and user friendly.  It has been designed to provide user-friendly, accessible information on employment rights generally and on the role of NERA specifically.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_681">Is the Minister of State satisfied that another Gama case will not arise in this country?  Will he ensure employees are paid an appropriate wage commensurate with their work?  Recent reports suggest certain seafarers are only receiving 50% of what they should be receiving.  Is the Government concerned about this and about the fact that some employers seem to have ways to circumvent the law?  On the last occasion on which staff were denied their due rights and wages, the State had to come to their assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">When will the employment law compliance Bill be introduced?  What were the obstacles referred to by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, this morning during Question Time?  What problems have led to an unanticipated delay in the introduction of a very important Bill?  Does the Minister of State agree that the failure to introduce it could have a significant impact on the forthcoming partnership talks on wage agreements?  I am not sensationalising this matter as it is exercising the minds of those in the trade union movement.  They will not sit idly by as the Government fails to address the issue.  Will the Minister of State state the exact date on which the legislation will be introduced?</p>
            <p eId="para_683">What will the Government do about agency workers, who have certainly been a cause for concern and on whom the trade union movement is now focusing?  The movement states it will take into account the Government's progress in ensuring the equitable treatment of agency workers at the negotiating table during the forthcoming talks.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_684">On employment rights and the protection of workers, we have a very strong corpus of legislation, covering every issue from redundancy to paternity and maternity leave.  The employment law compliance Bill will be published quite soon.  We are as exercised as anybody else with ensuring it will be published, fully debated and enacted with a view to establishing NERA fully on a statutory basis.  NERA is already established on an interim basis and can enforce the law in respect of breaches of employment rights.  The Government has increased the number of inspectors and we hope to have 90 in the very near future.  This is a fundamental commitment under Towards 2016 and we are honouring the commitments as best we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">I asked NERA to investigate the matter of the seafarers, to which Deputy Penrose referred.  It informed me quite recently that the boat in question is flagged in Honduras and run by a company registered in Cyprus.  With all due respect, NERA can only be responsible for companies registered in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">There were two commitments regarding agency workers.  We almost had a Bill ready in this regard but it must be remembered that some issues that are now being raised on agency workers are outside the scope of Towards 2016.  However, we are committed to publishing the employment agencies regulation Bill and the memorandum thereto will be presented to the Cabinet in the very near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">We are trying to live up to our commitments under Towards 2016.  However, some legitimate concerns were raised by some of the social partners and we are trying to deal with them.  I hope the employers, trade unions, Government and social partners will all acknowledge the challenges that exist when they commence talks.  The Government is very much aware of them and in this regard it must protect competitiveness and foreign direct investment in particular.  Some companies have expressed concerns in this regard.  The Government will not stand over any circumstances in which agency workers are exploited and given insufficient salaries.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_688">To be fair to the Minister of State, it is important to acknowledge that NERA represents real progress.  We do not yet have 90 inspectors but, given that there are approximately 79, we are at least approaching the target.  When does the Minister of State believe we will reach it?</p>
            <p eId="para_689">One may argue about whether the minimum wage is too high but the fact remains that it is set down in law, which law must be enforced.  The main penalty for not paying the minimum wage is the payment of arrears.  Should employers who do not pay the minimum wage not be fined and made pay through the nose?  Such fines would be paid to the agency.  If an employer skimps on €2 or €3 per hour, he should really be made pay when caught.  The fine should be used to help fund the agency and pay for the inspectors.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_690">I agree with the Deputy that we need strong deterrents but the fundamental issue concerns the ability to pay and the need to ensure that those who do not receive full payment will be compensated immediately.  If one were to seize the assets of a company expressing an inability to pay, it would make matters very difficult.  The priority is to ensure that those who do not receive fair pay or holidays are compensated immediately.  The labour inspectors are ensuring that arrears are paid.  By and large, the major concern of the worker is that he or she would be reimbursed and receive his or her full entitlements.  This in itself obviously serves as a deterrent to the employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">Over the coming years and on foot of the strong compliance legislation, which will be published shortly, employers will be very well aware of their rights and their obligation to ensure all workers are paid.</p>

At 6 a.m., 19 hours after she had arrived, she walked into a toilet unaccompanied where she was later found in a collapsed state by the nurses.  Medics telephoned her family at 6.20 a.m. but, due to a lack of parking space in the hospital grounds, the family were not able to arrive before she had passed away.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">Let me quote the statement of Mr. Colm Seville, the lady's brother, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 26 January:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_699">"When we reached the hospital, they brought us through another route so that we wouldn't have to see the place where she died," Mr. Seville said. "But at one point we ended up in the middle of Accident and Emergency and I just said to a nurse: ‘Please tell me my sister wasn't here'. People were sitting on chairs and in corners.  The doctors literally had to step over the patients.  It was like something out of the Third World."  Last night Mr. Seville said: "I felt sorry for the ordinary doctors and nurses on the ground, who are dealing with this on a daily basis."</p>
            <p eId="para_700">I am well aware of these dreadful conditions because I go to the hospital every Saturday and spend an hour there between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.  I inspect the conditions almost on a weekly basis and note that they are dreadful.  There is a prefabricated building which is totally unsuited to interaction between the patients and hospital staff.  The nurses and doctors do their best but there are long waiting lists.  The accident and emergency department is like a railway station or even a cattle mart.  People are coming and going and patients are in chairs and on trolleys in passageways and every other nook and cranny.  The situation deteriorates even further every winter.  I have gone there almost every week for four and a half years and the situation has not improved substantially in that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">The Minister speaks constantly about her ten-point plan and how community care services are being put in place.  In this way, she assures us, all this so-called bed-blocking, that dreadful phrase she uses, will be dealt with.  The reality, however, is that waiting lists persist and accident and emergency departments remain overcrowded.  Hygiene standards are atrocious.  It is simply not good enough that people who are seriously ill find themselves in the frightening situation of not knowing how long they must wait in such unacceptable conditions.  The Minister has been sitting on her hands on this issue, making promises but delivering nothing.  It is the most vulnerable section of the population, the elderly and seriously ill, who are most affected by the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">I received a letter on 26 November from Phil O'Neill, head of operations and clinical support in the Health Service Executive.  It stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_703">I am writing to express the hospital's concerns regarding your unauthorised contact with patients in the emergency department of the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital and respectfully request that you discontinue this practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">I have been calling into the hospital for four and a half years but now it seems I am not authorised to do so.  The letter continues:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_705">Hospital staff members in the emergency department work in an extremely challenging and stressful environment and must be permitted to fulfil their responsibilities without additional disruption from unwarranted personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">There has been a failure of management and leadership at the highest level in the HSE and the Department of Health and Children to deal with the matter.  I am not even sure whether the HSE is conducting an internal inquiry.  Such an inquiry is inadequate in any case.  There must be an independent external inquiry into the death of this young woman.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_707">I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">I extend my sincere sympathies to the family of the deceased at this most difficult time.  The Department of Health and Children has been in contact with the Health Service Executive about this case.  The HSE has advised that when it became aware of the death of the person concerned, it sought and received an immediate briefing from the hospital on the circumstances of her death and the management of her care in the accident and emergency department.  It is understood that she died while awaiting admission from the accident and emergency department.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The HSE has advised that the medical staff who attended to the deceased, along with the hospital's patient representative, met her next of kin to discuss the circumstances of her death.  In accordance with the Coroners Act, the hospital reported the matter to the coroner whose findings are awaited.  A coroner's post mortem was undertaken to establish the cause of death.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">The Department is advised that the HSE and the hospital concerned will be guided by the coroner's deliberations and any recommendations made.  This will inform the HSE's decision on any requirement for further action.  In the interim, the hospital is carrying out a risk assessment in line with normal procedures.  The hospital has assured the HSE it is anxious to provide whatever support the family considers appropriate in dealing with this difficult loss.  The Deputy will appreciate it would be inappropriate to comment on the specific circumstances of the case at this time.</p>

          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_307">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_711">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue which, like that raised by Deputy Costello, relates to the appalling conditions in which hospital staff must work, particularly in accident and emergency wards.  A report in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> states that patients on trolleys yesterday in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda were asked to give up those trolleys to accommodate more seriously ill patients admitted following a traffic accident.  Patients had no problem doing so but it is an indication of the appalling pressure on patients and staff.  It is unacceptable and disgraceful.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">The Minister was notified of the problems in the hospital last June.  Dr. Finbar Lennon, a senior consultant in the region, wrote a letter to the Health Service Executive at that time, which I understand was forwarded to the Department of Health and Children, expressing his concerns about the "failure of the management authorities at all levels to appreciate the impact and consequences of the current workload and throughput of cases in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital".  Mr. Lennon went on to state that, in his opinion, the situation was "very unsafe" and that he had called for a "fundamental reappraisal of the current strategy being pursued by management".</p>
            <p eId="para_713">It is a shameful situation.  The patients to whom I have spoken are very appreciative of the excellent treatment they receive from consultants, nurses and other hospital staff.  However, they cannot understand why adequate provision is not made to improve conditions.  Why does the HSE not provide the necessary services in Dundalk, Navan, Cavan and Monaghan to relieve the pressure on Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital?  The current conditions are unsustainable and unsafe.  Mr. Lennon's statement, which was brought to the attention of the HSE and the Department last June, is quite serious.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">What is the Government doing to improve this unacceptable situation?  The hospital is in chaos in terms of finding space for sick people.  A friend of mine attended the accident and emergency department last Monday and had to wait on a trolley for almost 36 hours.  The problem at that stage, before yesterday's crisis, was that there was only one bed for 30 possible patients.  This is an ongoing crisis.  While I fully acknowledge that there is a substantial difficulty in coping with the winter vomiting bug, the HSE has made an entirely inadequate provision for the care of patients in the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">How is the Minister accountable for this situation?  The Government has allowed the HSE to function in such a way that public representatives do not have a forum in which to raise such issues.  The Minister absolves herself of any responsibility and everything goes back to the HSE.  There must be accountability to the House.  The Minister must be able to answer our questions on certain urgent matters.  It is a shame that the wonderful staff of our Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and the sick patients who receive tremendous care from them must endure these appalling, disgraceful and shameful conditions.</p>

          <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_308" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_716">I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">My understanding is that the issues raised by the clinician in question relate in the main to the capacity of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, to manage the regional emergency workload within existing resources.  The issues raised were brought directly to the attention of the medical board of the hospital, the Health Service Executive and the Minister.  The Department raised the issue with the National Hospitals Office of the HSE and asked that the matter be followed up as a matter of urgency with the HSE north east which has operational responsibility for the provision of hospital services in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">The number of patients reporting to the accident and emergency department of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has increased in recent days and this has placed additional pressure on its capacity.  The HSE is working to ensure all possible measures are taken to alleviate the difficulty and to ensure the waiting time for patients is kept to a minimum.  The measures being put in place include increased ward rounds by consultants, and liaison with other hospitals to effect transfers, where appropriate.  Discussions are also taking place with a view to placing into more appropriate care settings patients whose acute phase of treatment has finished.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">In line with a commitment to improve the overall capacity and resources at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, the HSE advises that construction of a new accident and emergency department and additional clinical facilities commenced at the end of January this year at a cost of more than €11 million.  This project will provide for an accident and emergency unit on the ground floor encompassing some 1,300 sq. m of space with additional clinical facilities proposed for the upper floors.  This project will result in an almost 300% increase in the existing space available for the Department.  The HSE advises that the new emergency department is scheduled to be operational by the end of the year with 19 adult trolleys and six paediatric beds.  The HSE is also working to ensure that the hospital has the required capacity in readiness for the overall reconfiguration in the north-east area.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">The Teamwork Management Services Limited report entitled, Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards, which was prepared for the HSE found that the present system in the north east, whereby five local hospitals deliver acute care to a relatively small population, is exposing patients to increased risks.  The report recommended a three-strand action plan as follows: the development of a new regional acute hospital; the development of local services, with the existing five hospitals and primary and community care providers playing central roles; and the development of a series of clinical networks to bind local and regional services around the needs of patients, including networks for emergency care, surgery and critical care.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">The hospital reconfiguration process is being overseen by the HSE steering group.  Following a tendering process, the HSE appointed a firm of consultants to carry out an independent site location study for the new regional hospital.  The Department has been advised by the HSE that it anticipates that the consultants' report will be completed in February.  The report will then be considered by the board of the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">The first priority in the development of a fully integrated regional health service is to ensure that the people of the north east have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life-saving emergency care.  Over the next few years, in preparation for all acute emergency inpatient care and complex planned care being provided at a regional centre, the existing five hospitals will continue to provide services which meet the majority of health needs of the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">The HSE has given an assurance that in progressing the implementation of the Teamwork report, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_309">
            <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
            <p eId="para_724">While the issue I raise may not be as vitally important as the life and death ones my colleagues who spoke before me raised, the biggest issue in my area is the lack of schools.  A public private partnership for a site for schools was announced in 2005.  I believe that Wexford County Council has done a deal with the Department of Education and Science on the purchase of an 18-acre site in Gorey.  However, I am trying to find out what stage we are at in regard to the building of the schools on the site.  We are three years further down the line and there seems to be a dearth of information in this regard.  Nobody seems to know what is happening and whether there is to be one school or two schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">I tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Education and Science asking when something will happen, to which the response was "shortly", which is like asking "How long is a piece of string?"  I hope we will be given much more detailed answers to fair and valid questions.  When will planning permission be sought?  I believe there was an advertisement in the newspaper.  I have been told these are almost pre-packed, pre-built schools which will be constructed on site.  What sporting amenities will be available, which will be used by the general community as well as the school?  Perhaps the most important question is who will be the patrons of the school or schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">The last answer I got to a parliamentary question asking whether there would be one primary school or two primary schools on the site was that it had not been decided but, amazingly, a couple of weeks later there was a planning permission application for two schools.  I am not here to badger anybody but the lack of information and the manner in which I, as a representative from the area, have been treated are not good enough.  That decision had been made when I tabled that question because planning permission was applied for within a couple of weeks.  I got a short, terse reply that a decision had not been made.  That is not good enough and I hope the Minister will shed more light on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">The same questions apply in respect of the new second level school on that site.  When will planning permission be submitted?  What type of school will be built?  Who will be the patrons?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_310" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_728">I am taking this matter for the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, who wishes to thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I will outline the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and the current position in regard to the purchase of a site in Gorey, County Wexford.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">At the outset, modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 731 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of underinvestment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office the Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">The Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme to almost €600 million this year.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan almost €4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas while continuing to develop on the Government's commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation throughout the country.  It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, again with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">Turning to the specific matter raised by Deputy D'Arcy, the site in question of about 18 acres in Gorey is in the process of transfer to the Department from Wexford County Council.  As the Minister announced on 1 February last, it is planned to provide for two primary schools consisting of eight classrooms each in 2008.  It is expected that, in time, in each of these schools the number of classrooms will be increased to 16 with a special needs unit.  The Department also plans, in time, to provide a post-primary school on the site and this will form part of the master plan for the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">I thank the Deputy again for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position in regard to the purchase of a site in Gorey.</p>

            <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_738">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this serious issue.  Achieve ABA school in Donaghmede was established to provide education for autistic children.  It was founded by a group of parents whose children's needs were not being catered for by the Department of Education and Science.  The Minister for Education and Science provides a home tuition allowance to the parents of the children attending this school.  However, the allowance only covers 50% of the costs and as a result parents must come up with the other 50%, which is placing an enormous financial strain on them.  To make matters worse, the Minister now only provides the home tuition allowance on a monthly basis.  Meanwhile, parents are left not knowing whether they will receive this allowance.  This is a national disgrace.  The school is unable to plan for the future and cannot give tutors a guarantee that they will be paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">The ABA model is viewed worldwide as the best way to educate autistic children.  While it does not work for every autistic child, it has achieved outstanding results among many children.  Only last week, we witnessed the Ó Cuanacháin family being dragged through the courts as they fought to obtain education for their child, Seán.  They now face a massive legal bill.  It is one of the great scandals of this Republic that the parents of autistic children still have to go through the courts as a means of getting justice for their children because the education system has failed them so disgracefully over a period of prolonged prosperity.  There are 12 Government-funded ABA schools in operation on a pilot scheme.  The Minister for Education and Science stated recently in the Dáil that no more ABA schools will be built or funded and that all autistic children will be taught in mainstream schools.  All other ABA schools are now at risk because of the Department's intended position that these children will attend mainstream schools, whether they can manage or not.  However, students are attending ABA schools because mainstream schools are not providing for their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">I urge the Minister to recognise Achieve ABA school in Donaghmede and to allocate funding annually to the school.  I invite her to visit Achieve ABA and witness at first hand the excellent work it is conducting in educating autistic children. By visiting this school, the Minister will realise she is wrong to deny it a place on her pilot programme.  Allocating funding to 12 ABA schools in Ireland and ignoring the other ABA schools is grossly unjust.  All autistic children have the right to access the same standard of education.  The Minister's policy of not providing funding for additional ABA schools means that many autistic children are missing out on the best chance of leading a normal and productive life.  International research for the past 40 years has shown that up to half of children who engage in ABA as their primary method of preschool intervention go on to mainstream education without additional supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">The Minister's approach, which provides a range of educational approaches, is not working for lower functioning children.  It is obvious that both ABA local schools for autistic children and mainstream places are needed.  The Government's approach is useless to a large percentage of lower functioning children who need ABA schools.  The Minister should concentrate on developing a model to meet the teaching needs of all children with autism.  She should cherish all the children of the nation equally and not treat autistic children in Ireland as second class citizens.</p>

          <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_316" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_742">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current situation on Achieve ABA.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">The home tuition scheme was established to provide funding to parents for the education at home of children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">While the Department does not fund Achieve ABA directly, parents have been using the funding provided through the home tuition scheme to give this tuition in a group setting at the centre.  Home tuition funding cannot be provided indefinitely in respect of children who have school placements available to them.  A suitable school place is available for each of the children attending this centre.  Officials in the Department of Education and Science have written to the parents of the children attending the centre in question regarding the home tuition scheme.  The Government is committed to ensuring all children can have access to an education appropriate to their needs and abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">The Government believes that as each child with autism is unique, each child should have access to a range of different approaches to meet individual needs.  This view is informed by advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the inspectorate.  An analysis of research, including the report of the Irish task force on autism, also supports this approach while autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method.  By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methods, including ABA, we are doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">The Department of Education and Science has supported the use of ABA for many years and training is provided for teachers in its use.  However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that it should be the only method used.  While ABA can address certain needs, in particular behaviour other methods such as TEACCH and PECS are just as important, especially in developing children's communication and speech skills.  It is important that children have access to a range of methods so that their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">Hundreds of children with autism are integrated into mainstream schools and hundreds more are in autism-specific classes.  More than 275 autism-specific classes have been approved throughout the country while more are being set up all the time.  A testament to the scale of progress being made in this area is the fact that the number of such classes has increased by more than 40% in the past year alone.  There are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants.  Extra assistants are provided where the children need them.  A child can have his or her own SNA if needed.  Children in special classes have the benefit of fully qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA.  The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government.  Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">The Department of Education and Science and the National Council for Special Education have been working hard to ensure all children with autism have access to a range of approaches in special classes.  A number of years ago, before this extensive network was in place, some centres were approved for funding under an ABA pilot programme.  The Government is committed to long-term funding for these pilots subject to agreement on certain standards, such as appropriate qualifications for staff and the type of educational programme available to the children.  Discussions have taken place with Irish Autism Action with a view to advancing this commitment as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">Other centres, including the one to which the Deputy refers, are seeking funding under the pilot scheme.  Now that a national network of special classes is available, however, new centres will not be brought into the pilot programme.  We are determined instead to ensure each child has access to the autism-specific education being made available to schools throughout the country.  Appropriate placements are available in local schools for the children attending the centre in question.  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy and I thank him once again for raising the matter.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment  (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_755">I reject the inherent negative premise of the question posed by the Deputy. On the contrary, I am firmly convinced that the new EU Treaty will be of overall benefit to Irish workers. Our membership of the European Union has been very beneficial to Ireland from the point of view of Irish workers, as reflected in the strong growth in employment in Ireland in recent years, and the very positive legal framework for employment rights which has contributed to the quality of that employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">The current corpus of employment rights protection has been driven in large part by EU-wide legislative developments across a broad spectrum of employment protection legislation, providing equal treatment for the most vulnerable workers and attacking discriminatory practices such as discrimination based on gender and marital status. The whole approach to workplace safety has evolved considerably in the last ten to fifteen years, due in large part to rules initiated and formulated at EU level, and enshrined in EU Directives. Of further significance is the availability of EU appellate mechanisms, notably the European Court of Justice, in the development of the principles, and in interpretation, of key EU legal instruments.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">The new EU Treaty is a balanced document. It is good for workers because it helps strike the right balance between social protection and economic competitiveness. It will help to underpin the positive developments in employment rights protection and will assist in providing a positive environment for future progress. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is a central component of the new EU Treaty, which was formally ratified by European leaders in Lisbon, last October. The Charter, which is legally binding and enforceable on Member States, sets out a range of rights, freedoms and principles for EU citizens and workers. It sets out the values on which the Union is founded in a clear and comprehensive way. It should be welcomed by all concerned who profess to care about the rights and concerns of workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_759">An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, accompanied by myself, led an Enterprise Ireland trade mission to South Africa on what was by far the largest trade mission from Ireland to have ever visited that country.  The visit also facilitated the Taoiseach's involvement in a range of aid-related activities elsewhere in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">The mission had a number of objectives, namely to assist Irish companies access the South African market at the highest levels; to help Irish companies develop their business in South Africa and investigate all elements of the market; to reinforce Ireland's commitment to working in partnership with South Africa at Government and business levels; to raise Ireland's profile as a world class supplier of goods and tradeable services, to increase awareness of Ireland, in particular Ireland's recent economic performance; to increase awareness of Ireland's Education system and the links being established between South Africa and Irish institutions; to highlight the progress made in recent years in the development of economic links between the two countries — and to further strengthen these ties.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">Central Statistics Office figures for 2006, show that two-way trade between Ireland and South Africa was worth over €1.375 billion, with merchandise trade amounting to €500 million and services trade amounting to more than €875 million — and there is much scope for further growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">Many of the companies that participated in the mission are small and medium sized firms seeking local partners to expand operations in the region. An aim of the visit was to support Irish companies to develop a presence in South Africa through trade, investment, partnership and other business linkages.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">This mission saw 52 Enterprise Ireland supported firms form important links and partnerships in a region which has a population of 185 million people. Contracts to the value of €35 million will be realised, following the trade mission, by the Irish companies who participated. A total of ten significant agreements were signed during the visit. These include companies in a variety of sectors including food processing, software, telecommunications and power generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">Over 400 one to one meetings were held over the 5 days.  In addition Enterprise Ireland organised a detailed programme of visits, for ten of the participating companies, involving over 80 meetings.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_767">Regarding measures taken to avoid the job losses, I understand that IDA Ireland had discussions with Allergan management in Arklow with a view to having the company invest more heavily in technical process development and in significant process automation.  Unfortunately, the decision taken by the company was to move production to a more modern plant in Costa Rica which has spare capacity.  However, the company has confirmed that its other plants in Ireland will not be affected by the decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">In relation to Jacobs, I understand that Enterprise Ireland has had a number of discussions with the company over the last twelve months in relation to its development plans, and assistance has also been given to the company's innovation agenda.  After reviewing a number of options, the company has now taken the strategic decision to outsource its biscuit manufacturing operation.  However, the company has also indicated its commitment to undertaking new product development in Ireland by deciding to establish an innovation centre of excellence in biscuit manufacturing.  This decision is very much in keeping with Enterprise Ireland's strategy for innovation with the agency's client companies, as innovation is accepted as the key to gaining competitive advantage in the fast moving consumer goods sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">Regarding the steps being taken to help those being made redundant, the role of FAS, the Industrial Training agency, will be particularly important in this respect.  I understand that, in response to a request from the company for assistance, the agency is meeting with Allergen to discuss its full range of services.  I also understand that FAS has written to Jacobs indicating that it is prepared to offer its full range of services to any employees who wish to avail of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">While Dawn Meats does not come under my area of responsibility, I am aware of the situation in the company.  The company is consolidating beef production in its other plant some 25km away in Ballyhaunis, Co. Mayo in which, I understand, it plans to invest some €15m to provide scale and efficiency in processing for very competitive markets.  Furthermore, I understand that a Beef Forum is being established.  The Forum is to examine the beef sector in the light of prevailing opportunities and challenges and is to set out a framework for future development.  It is to hold its first meeting this month and report in the Summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">In relation to all three cases, I am confident that the enterprise agencies under the aegis of my Department have taken and are taking all appropriate measures to deal with the situation and that, in their on-going activities, they will continue to create investment and employment opportunities in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_773">I am aware of the situation at the Allergan plant in Arklow.  The decision taken by the company to close its facility by the middle of 2009 is very disappointing particularly for the workers and families involved.  I am confident that the Industrial Development agencies together with other local interests will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the area.  I will, of course, be prepared to meet with the various interested parties to discuss the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">The decision by the company to phase out operations over a lengthy period will allow its workforce to seek alternative employment.  I also understand that the company has committed to seeking suitable positions for staff at the Arklow plant in its other facilities in Ireland and overseas where possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">As regards retraining, the role of FAS, the Industrial Training agency, will be particularly important in assisting people who will lose their jobs.  I understand that, in response to a request from the company for assistance, the agency is arranging a meeting to discuss its full range of services.  This will include training and other supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">In its ongoing drive to attract investment opportunities to Arklow and Co. Wicklow in general, I understand that IDA Ireland is currently in negotiations with investors with regard to commencing or expanding operations in the agency's Arklow Business Park.  In addition, Servier Ireland Industries Limited, which is based in Arklow, is actively recruiting at present and employment figures have consistently increased over the last number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">I should point out that according to the last Quarterly National Household Survey published by the Central Statistics Office on 15 November, 2007, the unemployment rate in the mid-East area, which includes Arklow, was 3.9%.  As this is one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, the workers who will be laid off should have good prospects of obtaining other employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">I am satisfied that IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local County Enterprise Board will continue to promote Arklow and Co. Wicklow in general as attractive locations for employment and investment opportunities.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_322">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_780">I am fully aware that the price of a range of foods has increased in the last number of months.  Whilst the December 2007 Consumer Price Index as published by the Central Statistics Office shows that although the annual rate of inflation fell to 4.7% in December down from 5.0% in November, the price of food and non alcoholic beverages increased by 6.3% in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">Rising food prices are being experienced across the world due mainly to a number of factors including climatic, economic and demand reasons.  A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation has identified that the rapid expansion of the global biofuel industry is causing fundamental changes to agricultural markets and is likely to keep the prices of agricultural commodities high over the next decade.  A rise in input and transportation costs consequent on increased fuel and energy prices has also contributed to the increase in biofuel production.  Adverse weather conditions which have seen a two-year drought over large parts of Australia and an unusually wet summer over much of Western Europe in 2007 together with a drought in South-Eastern Europe has had consequent effects on food yields. This has coincided with an increased demand for meat and dairy products in significant developing markets such as China and India.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">Notwithstanding the global rise in food prices, national policy in so far as the price of food to Irish consumers is concerned, is focused on promoting a competitive grocery market and raising consumer awareness in relation to the need to get the best value for money when doing their grocery shopping.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">It is important that consumers are aware of the price of goods and services in order that they can make an informed choice before deciding whether to buy those goods and services from a particular trader or whether to go elsewhere.   To this end we have legislation in place, which ensures that consumers are provided with clear price information prior to making a decision to purchase goods.   There are four Price Orders currently being enforced by the National Consumer Agency.  In the alcohol and soft drink area there is the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order.  This Order obliges all premises where alcohol is sold to display the price of alcohol and soft drinks both inside and outside the premises.  The Charges (Hairdressing) Display Order 1976 (S.I. 156 of 1976) requires hairdressers to prominently display the charges for every service offered so that consumers will be informed before entering the premises.  The Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order, 1997 requires petrol stations to display their prices in a clear and prominent manner so that consumers can make an informed choice.  The European Communities (Requirement to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002, require that the selling price and the unit price for all products covered by the Regulations must be indicated.  Any infringements of these Regulations should be reported to the NCA.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">Whilst clearly the recent increases in the price of a variety of staple foods is a matter of some concern, I am confident that the current policy of promoting vigorous competition and raising consumer awareness together with the work of bodies such as the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency will help to ensure that consumers do not suffer from unwarranted price increases when doing their grocery shopping.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_787">I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 63 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">The last Quarterly National Household Survey on the labour market showed that the pace of employment growth actually accelerated slightly and employment over the year 2007 was up nearly 4%.  Last year total employment in the country exceeded 2 million for the first time, an increase of 78,000 on the same quarter in 2006 and net job creation in both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland was the highest since 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">Information received by the enterprise development agencies from client companies which have closed plants or downsized their workforces suggests that job losses have been attributable to a range of factors including loss of contracts or a drop in demand for products, restructuring and rationalisation within companies and relocation of operations abroad.  The last mentioned of these factors, according to the feedback from these companies, has been a relatively minor factor.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">It would be entirely misleading to suggest that plant relocation or company restructuring giving rise to job losses, whether due to individual firm or sector challenges, indicate that whole economies are uncompetitive. Ireland is deeply connected with the global economy. Our success over many years in attracting industry leaders in advanced manufacturing and service companies has transformed our enterprise base. An increasing part of our economy is now sophisticated, highly productive and value driven.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">What establishes the competitive credentials of the economy is our ability to replace quality jobs with others that are of the same or higher skill level. There is also no doubt that labour markets are changing at an increasingly fast pace due mainly to the impacts of globalisation, immigration and demographic factors. We are responding with new policies and new opportunities for our labour force.  Labour market programmes play an important role by providing the skills needed for unemployed persons to get back to work while at the same time providing the skilled labour needed by employers to improve their productivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">Fundamentally, our human resources are at the centre of our competitive advantage. Our National Skills Strategy sets out clear objectives for developing Ireland's human capital through upskilling, training and education. Our strategy will see an additional 500,000 employees being upgraded by at least one level on the National Framework of Qualifications by 2020. On training and skills development we have committed  €7.8bn in the period 2007-2013 under the national Development Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">In addition to the National Skills Strategy, the Government has made a major commitment, through the substantial investment set out in the Strategy for Science, Technology &amp; Innovation (SSTI) and the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013, to making the transition to a knowledge-economy by funding world-class research in Ireland.  Through the NDP and SSTI we are committed to providing €8.2 billion to ensure Ireland remains a key location for leading edge research and development, and the quality jobs it can deliver.  This represents a tripling of the spend provided for under the previous NDP 2000-2006, bringing Ireland into line with R&amp;D performance in leading countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">Finally, I want to point out that on our overall competitiveness, Ireland stands out in a number of categories. Our stock of direct inward investment is 5 times greater than the OECD average. Ireland continues to attract a large number of international greenfield investment projects, relative to its size. UNCTAD's 2006 World Investment Report shows that we are number 1 in the OECD for the number of greenfield foreign investment projects per capita.  The IDA confirm that the investment pipeline for 2008 remains strong.</p>

It was found that the level of redundancy had almost doubled and the cause may be attributed to two factors.  Firstly, there were more people at work in the more recent period; this accounted for 20% of the increase in the level of redundancies.Secondly, the risk of redundancy increased significantly in the second period and this accounted for 80% of the increase in the level of redundancy.</p>

            <p eId="para_815">The Enterprise Development Agencies under the aegis of my Department, Enterprise Ireland, the County Enterprise Boards, and IDA Ireland are responsible for growing indigenous enterprises and attracting and growing foreign direct investment. My Department has put in place a range of strategies, programmes and financial incentives to promote economic and enterprise development that will support sustainable employment throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">Enterprise Ireland (EI) recently launched their new strategy, ‘Transforming Irish Industry 2008-2010', which focuses on facilitating entrepreneurship and the enterprise environment in local and rural communities; driving the creation of innovation based start-ups, actively engaging in the Community Enterprise Scheme and proactively developing existing clients in all regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">Enterprise Ireland works with almost 490 client companies in the West Region employing 11,578 people and over 300 companies in the Midlands employing over 8,700 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">EI has approved support for Community Enterprise Centres in 30 locations approximately in the West &amp; Midlands Regions, which is helping to provide much needed workspace for the creation of new projects and businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">In addition, I am informed that two community enterprise centres in the West &amp; Midlands Regions were successful in their bid for funding under the Community Enterprise Scheme, Roscommon IT &amp; Knowledge Centre Ltd was approved for €300,000 and OAK Partnership, Edenderry, was approved for €532,000. Support is available for both capital infrastructure and management support.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) in the midland and western regions provide a source of support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial and non-financial support. During 2007 the Midland Region CEBs, comprising Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly paid out over €1.48m in grant assistance to 109 clients.  This intervention has assisted in the creation of 236 jobs in the region. The CEBs in the Western Region, comprising Galway, Mayo and Roscommon have paid out over €1.11m in grant assistance to 104 clients, which in turn, has enabled the creation of 328 jobs in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development. The National Spatial Strategy provides a framework for achievement of this goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the gateway and hub locations such as Galway, Limerick, Shannon, Athlone, Tuam and Mullingar. On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract Foreign Direct Investment into the gateways and hubs as well as a small number of additional locations in these regions. In the West, IDA is working with key overseas companies such as Medtronics, Boston Scientific and Baxter Healthcare. In the Midlands, some of the agency's clients include Tyco Healthcare, Elan and Abbot Laboratories.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies under the remit of my department will continue to bear fruit in terms of a regional development throughout the country.</p>

         asked the

         his plans to further attract senior researchers here to meet targets in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_327">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_826">The Government has made a major commitment, through the substantial investment set out in the Strategy for Science, Technology &amp; Innovation (SSTI) and the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013, to making the transition to a knowledge-economy. The ambition is that "Ireland by 2013 will be internationally renowned for the excellence of its research, and will be to the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture."</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The Government is committed to providing €8.2 billion to making this vision a reality and making Ireland a key location for leading edge research and development, and a location for high quality jobs that are underpinned by knowledge and high skill levels.  The Strategy recognises that building up the required number of researchers for this purpose includes the need to attract greater numbers of researchers to Ireland than before. A number of elements of the Strategy are contributing towards building world-class research teams in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) has been allocated a sum of €1.4bn under the NDP and this investment in SFI has resulted in a significant increase in the number of world class scientists here, demonstrating that Ireland is serious about science and offers an environment of competitive excellence.  In the context of achieving the national strategic targets set out in the SSTI SFI is investing in human capital across its range of innovative programmes and initiatives. The projects funded by SFI bring together significant numbers of Principal Investigators, senior researchers, Post Docs, PhD students and collaborators.  Apart from attracting international talent to Ireland under its broad suite of Programmes SFI has a number of very successful specific initiatives aimed at attracting international talent.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">As part of the recently launched Stokes Professorship and Lectureship Programme SFI awarded funding of  €44.55 million last November that will create 67 new research posts in Higher Education Institutes. The Programme will support 32 Professorships and 35 Lectureships and the successful candidates are internationally competitive, research-active academics, performing at the highest level appropriate to their career point. 49 of the 67 approved candidates are from outside Ireland. This substantially increases the recognition that Ireland is a location of choice for internationally competitive researchers and offers an environment of competitive excellence. It is an extremely positive signal for Ireland that such eminent researchers have chosen to further their scientific careers here.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">Another element of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation is to work towards removing obstacles to the mobility of researchers with a view to attracting researchers to Ireland in greater numbers than ever before.  Among the initiatives, which I have implemented to give effect to this are the establishment of a national mobility centre and mobility portal, as part of the European Network of Mobility Centres; and the implementation of the EU Council Directive on Third Country Researchers (2005/71/EC) which provides for the entry to the State of researchers to carry out research in a research organisation on the basis of a Hosting Agreement concluded between the researcher and the research organisation. The Hosting Agreement provides entry conditions comparable to those of the Green Card and also, importantly, provides for concurrent family re-unification and the right of family members to apply for a work permit without a labour market test.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">The Strategy also recognises that an important factor in building up the cohort of researchers in Ireland is the availability of an attractive career structure, both for Irish nationals considering research as a career and also in the attraction of international researchers to Ireland. To that end, the Advisory Science Council has been undertaking a wide-ranging study of the issues affecting researcher careers in this country, by reference to international best practice, and will shortly publish its findings. This report will bring forward recommendations which, when implemented, will assist in the goal of improving Ireland's prospects as a location for international researchers to further their careers.</p>

            <p eId="para_833">My Department is regularly in contact with the Department of Education and Science, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and FETAC in relation to accreditation issues.  I understand that at present in excess of 600 training providers have agreed their quality assurance arrangements with FETAC and can offer programmes leading to FETAC awards at Levels 1 to 6 of the National Framework of Qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">FETAC also accredits an extensive range of awards designed to prepare learners for employment across a range of occupations in the business, catering, construction, IT, and childcare to name but a few.  In addition to these awards, there are a number of general awards which are appropriate to business and enterprise development — for example Start Your Own Business, Enterprise Development, Business Administration and Management, Strategic Customer Relations Management, Business Appraisal, are all current awards which are validated by FETAC. The modular format of FETAC awards (a number of minor awards leading to a major award in a particular area) allows for flexibility for learners in achieving qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">In addition FETAC are constantly developing new awards and since January of this year have established Standard Development Groups to develop these awards. These groups will be comprised of the relevant stakeholders across education, training, industry and professional bodies. In addition, any provider, in an education or training institution in the public or private sector, or in a workplace or community setting, may submit a new programme or award for validation. In this way FETAC is well placed to identify and respond to changing demands from industry.  As this process is ongoing and is driven in part by the demands and needs of the relevant stakeholders including SMEs, it is clear that new programmes will be developed to meet the emerging needs of the stakeholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_837">The number of inspections/visits undertaken by Inspection Services in 2006 and 2007 to check compliance with the Protection of Young Persons Act (Employment), Act, 1996 was as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_838">in 2006; 3,347 inspections/visits were undertaken, 1,766 of which were conducted outside of normal working hours; and</p>
            <p eId="para_839">in 2007; 2,625 inspections/visits were undertaken, 1,695 of which were conducted outside of normal working hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 is designed to protect the health of young workers and to ensure that work during the school years does not put a young person's education at risk. The provisions of the Act encompass arrangements that are differentiated by reference to the age of young persons concerned, their school going status and whether school holidays are in effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">It is an increasing reality that many young people are taking on jobs, be it part time or full time during holiday periods. While many enjoy a very positive experience there is a risk that others may be exploited. It is important therefore that young people are aware of their rights and what steps they can take should they find those being breached.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">I would encourage employers to make themselves aware of their obligations under the Protection of Young Persons Act by contacting the National Employment Rights Authority's Information Services on 1890 80 80 90. I would also urge young workers who consider themselves to be victims of exploitation or others who may be aware of breaches of the legislation to contact the Authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_846">The Consumer Protection Act 2007, which commenced in May last year, empowers the National Consumer Agency to prepare and publish guidelines to traders in relation to matters of consumer welfare and protection and matters related to commercial practices. The Act also entitles the Agency to review or approve Codes of Practice submitted to it by traders or their trade associations where the Agency is satisfied that the Code of Practice protects consumer interests and is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act or any other enactment.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">The Agency has publicly stated its desire to establish a strong relationship with business to develop the highest standards of consumer protection and compliance by traders with consumer protection law. To this end, the Agency has held discussions with a number of business and representative bodies in relation to possible Codes of Practice. The Agency is also preparing Guidelines to business in two specific areas namely the Retail Sector and the Health and Fitness Sector. Following initial consultations with both sectors, the Agency is in the process of preparing detailed documents which reflect the views provided by businesses in those sectors and their representative bodies. The Agency intends to further consult with sectors concerned with a view to finalizing matters as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">I welcome the positive steps taken by the Agency in working with traders and their representative associations to develop a strong consumer culture amongst Irish business.

            <p eId="para_850">The Climate and Energy proposals published by the Commission on 23rd January are a complex package which raise economic and social issues for Ireland and thus require careful consideration by all Government stakeholders.  The Commission package includes the following elements:</p>
            <p eId="para_851">The separation of the EU Emissions Trading Sector (ETS) from the rest of the economy through the creation of a single EU-wide Emissions Trading Sector which will be administered by the Commission and has an EU-wide target of reducing emissions to 21% below 2005 levels by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">For the non-ETS sectors of the European economy (essentially transport, agriculture, residential and non-ETS enterprises), the Commission has proposed national targets, with a very challenging target of reducing emissions to 20% below 2005 levels by 2020 being proposed for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">National renewable energy targets, with a target of 16% of all energy usage to be derived from renewable sources by 2020 being proposed for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">In addition to the foregoing, the package also includes a proposal for a legal framework on Carbon Capture and Storage technology, and new guidelines for environmental state aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">In view of the complex, interlinking nature of the Commission package, any work to assess the competitiveness and employment implications for industry of the proposed national target for the non-Emissions Trading Sector of reducing emissions by 20% below 2005 levels by 2020 has to encompass the other elements of the package.  It is for this reason that the analysis of the socioeconomic implications of the Commission package for all sectors of the Irish economy is being undertaken under the auspices of the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, which is chaired by the Taoiseach. I am a member of the Committee, together with my colleagues the Minister for Finance; the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; the Minister for Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  To ensure that the analysis is as robust as possible, relevant stakeholders, including the Social Partners, will be consulted on the proposals, and a Technical Advisory Steering Group has been established to oversee the analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">Negotiations on the Commission package, which commenced this month, will be a comprehensive and complex process which is not expected to be completed until next year.  The Government has written to the Commission signalling that it expects detailed engagement on the package of proposals as a necessary prerequisite to any political agreement on the package.  The detailed analysis which is being overseen by the Technical Advisory Steering Group under the auspices of the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security will form the basis of Ireland's negotiating position.</p>

I am advised that the ship referred to by the Deputies is not, in fact, registered in Ireland.  The responsibility for safety, rates of pay and living and working conditions on the ship rests, therefore, with the ship operator and the country where the ship is registered.  As the ship is registered in another state, Irish employment rights do not apply to the employees on the ship.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, therefore does not have any power to enforce Irish employment rights legislation on board the ship.</p>

            <p eId="para_869">In accordance with commitments given under Towards 2016, the Social Partnership Agreement, the number of Inspectors was scheduled to increase to 90, from the starting position of 31, by the end of 2007.  Twenty new Inspectors were recruited by the National Employment Rights Authority during 2007 bringing the total number of Inspectors employed during 2007 to fifty one.

            <p eId="para_872">Assignment of the remaining Inspectors selected in the competitions is ongoing. For example NERA is awaiting release dates for some candidates required to work their contractual notice obligations. However, it is proposed to schedule training for these Inspectors immediately upon assignment.</p>

            <p eId="para_875">Where a contractual entitlement to recover a grant arises, it is entirely a matter for the agency that is party to the contract to effect the recovery.  I understand that the IDA has not yet sought recovery of the monies in this case.  IDA Ireland continues to maintain contact with Amgen as the company works through its restructuring phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">While I am very disappointed at the Amgen decision to postpone their proposed development at the Carrigtwohill, it must be noted that the Cork Gateway is still vibrant in what it can offer potential investors, particularly in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, medical technologies and internationally traded services.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_880">The Central Bank Financial Stability Report 2007 referred to by the Deputy looks essentially at the soundness of the financial system.  The Report makes clear that Irish credit institutions do not have significant exposures to the sub-prime market, either directly or indirectly. In relation to overall competitiveness, while acknowledging that our strong competitiveness position up to recently has undergone some decline, the report refers to the continued strong performance of inward FDI flows.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 4.9% on average in 2007. The euro area measure of inflation, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), was 3.2% for Ireland for the 12 months to December 2007. This was the same as the euro area average for the same period. The Central Bank, in their Quarterly Bulletin published last week, forecast inflation (HICP) to ease further to 2.5% in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">While this is welcome I should point out that we have no control over some of the factors influencing inflation, such as oil prices, the exchange rate and mortgage interest rates. In this regard, it is important to ensure that our domestic cost base does not undermine competitiveness. I agree with the NCC that, as part of our economic policy, seeking to maintain low inflation, promoting competition, the pursuit of sensible incomes policy, and keeping public spending growth at sustainable levels in the medium term are important. Doing this will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness and to maximise our economic potential. These are all part of our strategy to improve the cost environment and to enhance competitiveness. In the context of the forthcoming pay talks it will be critical to ensure that labour costs are managed so as to enhance productivity, support employment creation and to safeguard competitiveness. Furthermore, the Government's last three budgets have been clearly non inflationary as a measure to help the cost environment for business.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">I would also mention the Anti-Inflation Group which was reconstituted under Towards 2016 with the same membership and mandate as under Sustaining Progress and meets regularly. The Group has actively engaged with the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) with a view to co-ordinating and driving the fight against inflation on an informed basis.</p>

This represents a 3% increase on the Revised Estimates for 2007 and includes an additional amount of €1.7m from the National Training Fund to increase capacity for upskilling and in-company training.

            <p eId="para_894">With regard to the property side of the Department's move, the OPW completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre for the construction of my Department's permanent office in Carlow.  My colleague Minister of State Noel Ahern TD, announced on 13th December 2007 that the OPW has invited The Macquarie Partnership to become the ‘Successful Tenderer' in respect of this decentralisation project.  This forms part of a major PPP project, which also involves the provision of office accommodation for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar.  I am hopeful, subject to no planning issues arising, that construction of the permanent office will be completed in late 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">Agency Decentralisation</p>
            <p eId="para_896">Under the Government Decentralisation Programme, announced in December 2003, six of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise or have already been decentralised, as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_897">FÁS</p>
            <p eId="para_898">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, FÁS is due to transfer its head office including some 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly.  FÁS currently has 21 staff members based in Birr who are working out of offices located within the Birr Technology Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">FÁS has completed the purchase of 5.59 acres (approximately) in Birr, Co Offaly.  A Planning Application is currently being progressed on behalf of FÁS by the vendor's Consultant Engineers and Architects, in discussion with the Consulting Engineers and Architects representing FÁS.  In the meantime, since 6 May 2007 FáS has leased a floor of a building within the Birr Technology Centre to accommodate staff in the decentralised location pending the construction and fitting out of a permanent Headquarters.  Enterprise Ireland Enterprise Ireland (EI) is to move 300 posts to Shannon under the decentralisation programme. Progress on the full transfer of EI's HQ to Shannon, within the Government decentralisation programme, will be influenced by many factors including among others, the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants and progress made in discussions at a national level.  To date, no post has moved to Shannon under this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">Enterprise Ireland (EI) working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW) has identified, but not yet acquired, a preferred site for the construction of a new HQ building in Shannon.  The preferred site is a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development.  The site occupies a prime position in Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">EI now has a major presence in the Shannon region. EI has established its new National Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and has established the County Enterprise Support Unit in Shannon. Currently there are 40 staff working in the Shannon office and it is expected that approximately 65 EI staff will be in place in Shannon over the coming months.  A senior manager has been appointed as Head of Regions and Entrepreneurship to oversee the establishment of the EI presence in the Mid-West Region. EI managers with responsibility for the County Enterprise Coordination Unit and EI Regional Development strategy as well as the Regional Director with responsibility for the Mid West Regional are now in place in the Shannon office.  As part of EI's regional strategy, these six posts were assigned to the new office in Shannon from Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">Health and Safety Authority</p>
            <p eId="para_903">The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co Kilkenny as part of the decentralisation programme.  To date a total of 65 civil and public servants, including 12 Authority staff, have expressed an interest through the Central Application Facility (CAF) process in transferring to Thomastown.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">In advance of decentralising to Thomastown, the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city.  Currently, 27 staff, including 3 of the 12 internal HSA Thomastown applicants, are based in Kilkenny, and including also new staff recruited for the REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) strategy. All staff currently accommodated in the interim office will move to Thomastown once the new premises are ready for occupation.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">The Commissioners of Public Works have signed a contract to purchase the site in Thomastown.  A condition of the contract is that the vendor obtains the appropriate zoning for the site so that the Commissioners' planned development can take place.  The required change of zoning has now been granted and the sale should close shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">When the purchase is completed, expressions of interest for the design and build phase will be invited from interested parties.  It will be a matter for the successful tenderer to apply for planning permission at that stage.  The current estimated timeline for availability for occupancy is 2009/2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">NSAI</p>
            <p eId="para_908">Under the Government's decentralisation programme the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is due to relocate to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.  The number required to decentralise from the NSAI is 132.  A total of 10 Dublin based staff of the NSAI have applied to decentralise to Arklow.  In addition a further 86 Dublin based civil and public servants have applied for decentralisation to Arklow.  No staff from the NSAI have transferred to Arklow to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">The accommodation requirements for the NSAI in Arklow are being addressed by the OPW.  To date no progress has been made by the OPW in identifying or securing suitable office accommodation in the Arklow area.  The current NSAI implementation plan anticipates a target date of April 2009 as the completion date.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">National Consumer Agency (NCA)</p>
            <p eId="para_911">The National Consumer Agency (NCA), which will be located in Cork City, was formally established on 1st May 2007.  The NCA is currently staffed by employees of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment seconded to assist the Agency.  The precise location of the Agency within Cork City, is under consideration at present.  The Department of Finance has granted sanction for an overall complement of 80 members of staff.  Furthermore, discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance in relation to the manner in which the Central Applications Facility shall apply to the relocation.  The Agency is expected to relocate to Cork in the course of 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_913">he Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) was established in December, 2005, and moved to its offices in Naas, Co. Kildare in the following month.  All IAASA staff have been based in its offices in Co Kildare since its establishment, and as such the Authority is fully decentralised.  Its offices are leased on its behalf by the Office of Public Works, said lease being for 20 years expiring in September, 2025.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_916">I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 41 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">The primary agencies under the remit of my Department with responsibility for supports and initiatives for indigenous enterprises in Donegal are Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Donegal County Enterprise Board (CEB).  Enterprise Ireland provides funding and expertise to companies with ten or more employees in the indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors who wish to expand through increased export activity.  Through its network of 34 overseas offices, Enterprise Ireland assists client companies to create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">Enterprise Ireland's policy objectives for balanced regional development are reflected in the structure of its funding offer, whereby, funding for existing company expansion and start-up businesses is biased towards the regions.  The maximum grant level is higher than in Dublin and the Mid-East and a higher proportion of this funding is also non-repayable.</p>
            <p eId="para_919">As regards the Donegal County Enterprise Board, its role is to provide support to micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support the Board supports individuals, firms and community groups provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">Financial support is available in the form of Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study grants.  In relation to non-financial support, Donegal CEB engages in a range of activities to stimulate enterprise and to support small businesses.  Also, Donegal is a key target location for IDA and the County is now competing for a different type of business to labour intensive manufacturing, on which it relied so heavily in the past.  Investors are, in the main, seeking a large urban base with third level education facilities, well developed infrastructure as well as top quality business services that are international in focus.  In line with this, IDA Ireland has adopted a focused approach in the County with Letterkenny as the main location for IDA development efforts.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">Since my initial appointment as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in September 2004, I have had many meetings and briefings with and from the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the County Enterprise Board.  I have also visited County Donegal on a number of occasions since my initial appointment and met with local business and representative organisations in towns and villages such as Letterkenny, Buncrana, Moville, Donegal, Ballybofey and Stranorlar, Lifford, Killybegs and Ballyshannon.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">As regards unemployment figures, these are not available on a county-by-county basis, although the latest C.S.O. live register figures show 9,651 persons in County Donegal on the live register in January 2008.  Despite past difficulties in County Donegal due to the demise of traditional industries such as agriculture, fishing and textiles, there is clear evidence that the county is successfully engaged in a transition to the new economy.  Progress has been made by the IDA in securing new high value investments from Pacificare, Pramerica, SITA and Abbott Diabetes with some 1,200 new jobs being added in the County by overseas firms over the last five years.  These companies continue to recruit and are actively seeking new staff.  Between 2004 and 2006, Enterprise Ireland client companies created 1,156 jobs as against 980 jobs lost with Enterprise Ireland also approving some €15m in support to its Donegal client companies.  The County Enterprise Board has to date paid out some €7m in grant assistance to over 300 clients, which has assisted in the creation of  some 1,400 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">I can assure the Deputy that funding support and initiatives for enterprises in County Donegal is, and will remain, a priority for the State development agencies under the auspices of my Department.</p>

        <b>Deputy David Stanton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         the efforts his Department and bodies under the aegis of his Department are making to attract industry and develop indigenous industry with a view to creating employment in Youghal; the number of enterprises for which his Department or bodies under the aegis of his Department have been notified of closures in the Youghal area in the past ten years with a breakdown of the number of jobs lost in each of these; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_925">In the ten year period 1998 to 2007, four Youghal based IDA supported companies have closed with a total loss of 407 jobs.  In the same period, two Enterprise Ireland client companies closed with a combined loss of 45 jobs.  Details of these closures are set out in the tabular statement.  While job losses at any time are to be are to be regretted, particularly for those who actually lose their jobs, it must be remembered that job gains and losses are a normal part of economic activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">In general, the East Cork area has benefited greatly from investment in recent times.  In order to build on our existing successes, the focus should be on building critical mass at regional, as opposed to local, level.  The agencies under the remit of my department have a range of strategies, programmes and financial incentives in place that are designed to promote economic development and sustainable employment throughout East Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">The strategies and programmes of the development agencies are very much in line with the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and the National Spatial Strategy, which have been specifically designed to encourage economic development and job creation across the country as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">The enterprise development agencies have seen the emergence of an economic corridor along the N25 with the initial development of Little Island many years ago followed by new developments at Eastgate, Fota Business Park, Carrigtwohill and Midleton all of which are within easy commuting distance of Youghal.  IDA Ireland has found that the availability of quality property solutions in the East Cork area has proved attractive to visiting IDA clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">I am satisfied that the actions of the development agencies together with the continued roll out of the NDP will continue to bear fruit in terms of economic development for the people of the area generally.</p>

My Department launched a public consultation process in relation to the commencement of these provisions of the Act in the summer of 2007. Almost 50 submissions were received in response to the consultation process. The submissions gave rise to a number of complex matters, which require careful consideration. I hope to conclude consideration of these issues shortly.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_957">The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has been established on an interim basis since February 2007.  The Authority will be established on a statutory basis on the enactment of new Employment Law Compliance Bill which I propose to publish shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">A budget allocation of €8.553 million was provided for NERA for 2007 and this has increased to some €10.8 million for 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">Three units which were formerly part of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been subsumed into NERA — the Employment Rights Information Unit, the Labour Inspectorate and the Prosecution / Enforcement Unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">Department of Finance sanction was secured for a total staff complement for NERA of 141, including an increased complement of 90 Labour Inspectors.  The Director of NERA was appointed and took up duty on 12 February 2007.  The Director is supported in his role by a management team including legal and accounting expertise and an administrative staff which are now fully in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">Considerable progress has been made in the recruitment and deployment of Labour Inspectors over the past year with 49 of the additional 59 inspectors having been assigned to NERA.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">As part of the Government's decentralisation programme, NERA established its headquarters in Carlow at the end of July 2007.  The Social Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016" also provided that Inspection Services would be established on a regional basis.  In this regard, regional Inspection Services offices are now operating in Shannon (temporary accommodation), Cork and Dublin while accommodation for the Sligo regional office has been selected.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">In line with the commitment under "Towards 2016", joint investigation activity and exchange of information has commenced with Inspectors from NERA, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The necessary legislative provisions to enable the exchange of information between the three bodies came into effect on 30th March, 2007 with the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">NERA carried out some 14,400 inspections and recovered some €2.5m in arrears for workers during its first year of operation in 2007.  Specific inspections campaigns were targeted at enforcing the minimum wage, protecting young workers and at the construction sector.  Over 93,000 calls seeking information on employment rights were received by NERA in 2007.  NERA also continued with its prosecution remit with 98 cases being referred to the Chief State Solicitors Office in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">NERA launched a major public awareness campaign on the 14th of January 2008 to introduce it to the general public.  The style of the campaign is open, accessible and approachable, focusing in the first instance on NERA's role in providing information on employment rights related to questions that arise in the modern Irish workplace whether from employers or employees.  The integrated campaign will be ongoing throughout 2008 across the full range of media including TV, radio, national and regional press, specialised publications, outdoor and web based advertising.  The key message of the campaign is "Employment Rights, it's the law, you need to know".</p>
            <p eId="para_966">The launch of NERA's website, www.employmentrights.ie, is also an important resource for employers and employees alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">NERA continues to consult with its range of stakeholders and has initiated a structured dialogue with the parties to the Social Partnership Agreement, ICTU, IBEC and the Construction Industry Federation on the development of a comprehensive and responsive system of employment rights compliance and enforcement.  NERA invited its key stakeholders to a briefing on the 10th of January in respect of its activity and National Awareness Campaign.  NERA also engaged constructively during 2007 with other stakeholder organisations such as the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and the Citizen Information Centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">This is a new era for employment rights compliance and enforcement.  With increased staff and new locations NERA will be extending its activities and capabilities and building a strong public profile.  I wish the Authority well as it makes an enhanced contribution to the quality of our workplaces which is a key economic and social priority of this Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_970">In its first 11 months of operation (February 2007 to end December 2007), a total of 2,974 permits issued under the Green Card Scheme.  This figure represents close to one third of total new employment permits issued by the Department in 2007 and represents an increase over the 2,713 permits issued in 2006 under the Work Visa/Work Authorisation Scheme, which the Green Card Scheme replaced.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">The Green Card Scheme was established to fill skills shortages, identified in consultation with the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, in strategically important areas of the economy.  A Green Card, as distinct from a Work Permit, therefore, is only available for highly qualified applicants in certain skilled occupations.  The majority of such posts must offer an annual salary of at least €60,000.  For a small number of occupations, posts with salaries between €30,000 and €60,000 qualify.</p>

            <p eId="para_973">In order to ensure optimal coordination in the implementation of the National Skills Strategy in the training sector and to avoid any possible over-lap or duplication my Department established the Upskilling Co-ordination Group last year.  This group, which is chaired by my Department, brings together representatives of FÁS, Skillnets, Enterprise Ireland, the County Enterprise Boards and Forfas.  The core work of this group is to ensure the most effective and strategic application of public budgets provided for the continuing training of those at work.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">The group is responsible for ensuring that training programmes delivered by those in receipt of Departmental funding are fully co-ordinated both in terms of strategy and implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">Since its inception the group has allowed my Department to have a greater focus on the coordination of the training programmes and objectives of the respective bodies and has allowed for a greater emphasis to be placed on upskilling workers on lower rungs of the vocational ladder — as committed to in both Towards 2016 and in the National Development Plan.  I currently have no plans to re-organise the bodies referred to by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">The Wage Subsidy Scheme provides financial incentives to employers and employees, outside the public sector to encourage the employment of people with disabilities.  The scheme was implemented by FÁS, on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment, in September 2005 on the basis of an initial three year pilot that would be subsequently reviewed within this time frame.  The scheme is currently being reviewed by external consultants commissioned by the Department.  The review will assess the operation of the scheme and its impact to date.  It aims to identify areas which may be built upon to ensure that the scheme may achieve the maximum effect in meeting its original objectives of:</p>
            <p eId="para_978">facilitating people with disabilities to enter paid employment in the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">encouraging employers to employ people with disabilities</p>
            <p eId="para_980">giving people with disabilities the opportunity to experience open labour market employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">The Department of Social and Family Affairs has responsibility for the Back to Work Allowance.  Accordingly, any decision with regard to any extension of this allowance is a matter for that Department.  The Back to Work Allowance scheme allows unemployed people, lone parents and people on certain disability payments to take up employment and retain a percentage of their social welfare payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The FÁS funded Supported Employment Programme is an active labour market initiative to assist people with a disability who are job ready to find a job, leading to independence and career progression.  The programme is being reviewed by external consultants commissioned by FÁS.  The scope and terms of reference for this review include the making of recommendations that may further enhance the overall effectiveness of the programme in providing employment opportunities for people with disabilities.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_984">Data from the CSO quarterly industrial survey shows that average industrial earnings per hour for male industrial workers on adult rates in June 2007 was €16.62.  For female industrial workers the average rate was €12.73.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">From the CSO National Employment Survey for March 2006, average hourly earnings were €20.59 for males and €18.22 for females.  These latter figures cover the entire economy in March 2006 (excluding employees in agriculture, forestry and fishing).</p>
            <p eId="para_986">The gender pay gap has fallen consistently and is now below the EU average of 15%.  The most recent official figures from Eurostat (2005) put the gender pay gap at 9%, placing Ireland fourth lowest among the EU27.  This compares with a rate of 14% in 2003, showing a drop of 5% in two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">Primary responsibility for policy in relation to the gender pay gap is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is, however, a multi-faceted task involving a number of Government Departments and agencies as outlined in the National Women's Strategy, 2007-2016.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment undertakes the following actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">I am responsible for the National Minimum Wage legislation.  The national minimum wage was introduced in Ireland in April 2000.  Since its introduction there have been six increases to the minimum rate.  The most recent increase saw the minimum wage increase to €8.65 per hour, which is the second highest in the EU.  The introduction of the national minimum wage in 2000 has had a positive impact on women who previously were more likely to have received very low wages in sectors which were predominantly female.  Prior to the introduction of the minimum wage, the gender pay gap was at 22%.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">My Department is responsible for chairing and providing the secretariat for the National Framework Committee on Work/life Balance Policies.  This Committee, which was established under the social partnership process, comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and a number of Government Departments.  The Committee has undertaken and continues to undertake a range of activities to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work/life balance at the level of the enterprise, including the provision of financial assistance to organisations, information dissemination activities, seminars, research etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">"Expanding the Workforce", which is run by FÁS, is aimed at proactively encouraging women to return to work. The initiative facilitates women returnees by ensuring that training is provided in a flexible manner and is tailored to meet business requirements and skills needs of employers.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_993">I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 58 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">Following a period of extensive consultation, proposals for an Employment Agency Regulation Bill which will modernise the regulation of the employment agency sector and which will repeal and replace the Employment Agency Act 1971, have now been finalised, and I intend to submit to Government later this month a Memorandum seeking approval for the drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">My Department has engaged with ICTU regarding assertions that agency workers are being used increasingly to undermine basic labour standards and are precipitating a "race to the bottom".  The Department would welcome specific evidence supporting this thesis and I would urge anyone who has information to forward it to the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">Ireland's comprehensive body of employment rights legislation provides that employee protection applies to agency workers in Ireland, including agency workers posted to Ireland, who have entered into a contract of employment that provides for him or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment.  This means that, irrespective of nationality or place of residence, agency workers have the same rights under employment rights legislation as other employees.  Indeed this is acknowledged by SIPTU which has included a full listing of such entitlements in an information leaflet on agency workers of June 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">With regard to enforcement, the National Employment Rights Authority and its Labour Inspectorate pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the Inspectorate seeks redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.  It should be noted also that, in many cases, Employment Rights Legislation has provisions whereby workers who believe that they have been denied their entitlements, or otherwise unfairly treated, can take the matter before dispute settling agencies such as the Rights Commissioner Service, Labour Court and Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I urge anyone who has specific evidence of the mistreatment of agency workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the Inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_999">I am committed to working with my counterparts in Northern Ireland to implement all-island initiatives where there is mutual economic benefit including in the area of labour market and skills.  This area of North/South co-operation was identified in the Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy, published in 2006, as a means to optimise the skills pool on the island for continued prosperity in the knowledge economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">There is well-established co-operation between my Department and its agencies with their Northern counterparts. FÁS and the Northern Department of Education and Learning (DEL) have developed ongoing cooperation at both official and project levels through a variety of cross-border initiatives.  These include research and analysis into skills needs and how to address them, for example through the Northwest Workforce Development Forum, set up as a cross-border entity to examine the needs of the North-West's economy and identify growth sectors and skills needs; joint planning of courses and events; joint participation in Redundancy Clinics for cross-border workers being made redundant; developing and implementing a pilot training project in the North West for those most at risk of unemployment through lack of relevant work skills; cross-border Jobs fairs, joint advertising of all FÁS/DEL listed vacancies, and cooperation in recruiting where large numbers of vacancies are involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">In the area of labour market skills forecasting, I have asked the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs to liaise with their counterparts, the Northern Ireland Skills Expert Group, to examine the possibility of implementing an all-island approach.  I am aware that both Expert Groups intend to produce an All-Island Statement of Skills Demand and to organise an All-Island skills conference this year.  I understand that work is progressing well on both these initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">The Enterprise Ireland strategy for 2008-2010 ‘Transforming Irish Industry' targets the development of leadership and management capability of client companies as a core enabler for success and scaled international growth.  These management development initiatives are designed to support company capabilities in strategy and leadership, sales and marketing, innovation and entrepreneurship.  Enterprise Ireland liaises with Invest Northern Ireland on these management development programmes and facilitates participation from Northern Ireland companies on these initiatives, as appropriate.  Another initiative is the "Transform — Ideas Into Businesses Programme" which is a one-year full-time business incubation programme funded by the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and run by Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">InterTradeIreland, the all-island trade and business development body, has been collaborating with Skillnets, the enterprise led learning networks body, to promote North/South co-operation in this critical area and is assisting with the delivery of a series of cross-border Skillnets in the following sectors: — Software, Wireless, Polymers, Food and Drink, Digital Media and Construction.  InterTradeIreland is also working with Forfás and Northern Ireland partners on a proposed Managerial Skills Benchmarking exercise to be undertaken on an all-island basis in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1007">The number of deaths recorded in workplace accidents during 2007 was 67 compared to 51 fatalities in 2006.  I would like to record my sympathy to the relatives and friends of those who were bereaved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">Unfortunately, the same sectors keep surfacing as having the most accidents and the same causes are continuously attributed to fatalities.  Construction, fishing and agriculture topped the list in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">There were 18 deaths in the construction sector in 2007 compared to 13 in 2006.  There were over 7,000 non-fatal work injuries overall reported to the Authority in 2007.  The most common non-fatal accident triggers for all sectors were handling, lifting and carrying (34%), and slips, trips and falls (18%).  These have been the two most common accident triggers every year since 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">I am concerned at the increase in fatalities in the construction sector.  The Health and Safety Authority will continue to focus its inspection and awareness campaigns in these and other high-risk sectors and will continue to work with employer and employee organisations to make workplace safety, health and welfare an integral part of doing business in every workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">The Authority's programme of work for 2008 sets out its key priorities and activities and targets a 10% increase in the number of workplace inspections this year to 17,500.  In relation to the construction sector the Authority will carry out 7,000 construction site inspections in 2008.  Also, the Authority will continue to implement the 2006 Construction Regulations and Safe System of Work Plan (SSWP).</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">In addition to this in 2008 the Authority will also develop, consult on and publish codes of practice on construction anchors, pre-cast concrete and roofwork.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1035">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was established in April 2004 as part of the Government's insurance reform programme, with the aim of allowing certain classes of personal injury claim, where liability is uncontested, to be settled without the need for the costs associated with litigation.  The threat of rising insurance costs at the time posed serious risks to Irish business and the economy generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">Since its establishment the PIAB has successfully fulfilled its legal obligations: the PIAB is now assessing many claims three times faster and four times cheaper than under the old litigation system.  To the end of Q3 2007, the PIAB had made actual savings of €61 million on awards totalling €270 million, when compared with the old, unwieldy, adversarial and litigation-based system.  This is quite an achievement in such a short space of time, and can only be good news for accident victims, for business and for consumers generally who have seen, and should see further, reductions in their insurance premiums.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">The PIAB has pared down the personal injury claims process in a wholly positive way.  In 2003 it is estimated that the number of personal injury cases going through the Irish Courts system was in the region of 32,000 cases whereas the estimated figure for 2006 is 15,900 cases.  The effects are felt throughout the Court system where valuable time has now been freed up to deal with cases that should more properly reside there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">At the end of Q.3 2007 there were 4,815 cases with the PIAB in the 90-day "consent to process" period i.e. PIAB has received a claim and has issued formal notice to the responding party and is awaiting consent to process from that party.  There were a further 6,325 cases in the nine-month statutory assessment process, where the responding party has indicated that liability is not contested and damages are being assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">Approximately 13,300 assessments have been made to the end of Q.3 2007, 6,500 of these having been issued by the end of 2006.  Of the assessments issued 7,533 have been accepted, 4,707 have been rejected and authorised to proceed to litigation, and responses are awaited on the balance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">Delivery costs are 4 times cheaper than old system</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">Average delivery costs at approx €1,407 flat fee equating to approx 7% of awards as against old system of 46%, e.g. a €15,000 award in the old system would have attracted costs of an additional €7,500 approximately.  Under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board these costs would be €1,350.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">Some of the rejected assessments will have been resolved since PIAB involvement and others will proceed to the Courts.  The PIAB would not be aware of the number of these cases which actually proceed to litigation, although it is believed that a significant proportion are settled outside of the Courts once an authorisation issues from the PIAB.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">At the end of Q.3 the Board had 74 staff members in employment (up from 53 in May 2006) and was in the process of recruiting to bring numbers towards the staffing level of 85 agreed with my Department.  There are no plans at this time to further review staffing levels in the PIAB.</p>

            <p eId="para_1061">I understand that a restructuring of the manufacturing activities of the company in question will lead to a cessation of production at its biscuit factory in Tallaght by early 2009.  The planned restructuring will include an investment programme and the company expects to employ 120 people at that stage in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">Enterprise Ireland has had a number of discussions with the company over the last twelve months in relation to its development plans and assistance has been given to the company's innovation agenda.  After reviewing a number of options, the company has now taken a strategic decision to outsource its biscuit manufacturing operation.  However, the company has also indicated its commitment to undertaking new product development in Ireland by deciding to establish an innovation centre of excellence in biscuit manufacturing.  The agency will seek to continue working with the company to assist it to develop new products and processes and enhance its famous range of brands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">The redundancies at the company will take place on a phased basis from September 2008, through to early 2009.  The role of FÁS, the Industrial Training agency, will be particularly important.  The agency has already written to the company and a response is currently awaited as to how and when the company wishes to proceed.  The agency is prepared to offer its full range of services to any employees who wish to avail of its services.  I am aware of the significance of the job losses in such a long established company and every effort will be made to assist the employees.  I understand the company is entering into talks with employees and unions immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">As regards manufacturing jobs, there is no doubt that some traditional and long established industries are under pressure while other industries, especially the service industry, are providing much employment.  In recent years, more than 440,000 jobs have been created in services and 150,000 in high-end manufacturing.  There has in effect, been a significant turn around in the nature of employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">The State Development agencies will continue to work together and with local interests to promote employment opportunities for Tallaght.  I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued in the area by the agencies will maximise the flow of potential investors and convert these into investment and job opportunities.  The development of the Grangecastle Business Park, which Microsoft Corporation has selected for its new data centre, combined with the development of the City West Business Park will ensure that the overall area is an attractive location for investment.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1077">I am aware of the 2007 edition of the Consumers in Europe Report recently published by Eurostat. The Report contains facts and figures on a number of different services of general interest to consumers in the European Union including information on price levels in the various member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">The Report does show that household consumption expenditure in Ireland is above the average for the 25 member states of the Union. The December 2007 Consumer Price Index as published by the Central Statistics Office, shows that although the annual rate of inflation fell in December, it is currently running at 4.7%. In terms of comparison with price trends in other member states of the EU, the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is accepted as the most appropriate measure for such comparisons, shows that inflation in Ireland in the 12 months to December is 3.2% which is at the same rate as the harmonised index for the EU as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">An analysis of the Eurostat Report, the CPI and the EU harmonised indices all show that prices for particular goods and services such as housing, transport, food and communications are significantly higher in Ireland than the EU average. Whilst these price levels do reflect in some measure recent rises in interest rates and global trends in food prices, they are matters of concern particularly in terms of our national competitiveness. In this regard, it is important to ensure that our domestic cost base does not undermine competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">Government policy in the area of prices is concentrated on promoting competition and raising consumer awareness in relation to the need to achieve the best value for money. In the area of competition, the Deputy will be aware of the fact that in conjunction with the abolition of the Groceries Order, which had the effect of keeping the price of groceries higher than they should have been, the Competition Authority undertook to review and monitor the grocery sector in the light of the changed regulatory environment. The Authority expects to finalise its analysis of developments in the grocery sector, which will focus on price trends, market structures and barriers to entry at the end of this month. I would also advise the Deputy that the Authority is committed, under Towards 2016, to keep under review the impact of the regulatory environment in the context of abuse of dominant positions including excessive and predatory pricing and to report to Government in relation to any recommendations arising from its findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">Aside from the ongoing work of the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency, as part of its statutory function to raise consumer awareness, has commenced surveys in relation to the cost of household grocery items in various retail outlets. The results of its initial pilot survey, which examined the price of a selection of common branded goods, were published in July 2007. The Agency has since conducted a wider survey covering a more extensive range of goods, the results of which will be published shortly. Whilst the foregoing focuses on the work of the Authority and the Agency in the grocery sector, expenditure on food represents a significant element of overall consumer household expenditure as evidenced in the findings of the Eurostat Report. Accordingly, I fully support the activities of the Authority and the Agency in seeking to ensure that there is strong competition in the grocery sector and that consumers are fully aware of the price of grocery items so that they can get the best value for their money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">Aside from grocery expenditure, it is important that consumers inform themselves in relation to the price of all the various items which make up their overall household expenditure. In this regard, there is legislation in place which obliges traders to provide consumers with price information in relation to products that they sell. The European Communities (Requirement to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 require that the selling and unit price for all products covered by the Regulations must be indicated. Consumers have a responsibility to acquaint themselves with the price information provided so as to ensure that they get the best possible value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">I note that in presenting the Eurostat report, the European Commissioner for Consumers, Meglena Juneva, expressed the view that consumers cannot properly assess their options or decide how to act without access to information that is as objective as possible. In this regard, I am confident that the work of bodies such as the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency will help to ensure that consumers can access the necessary information so that they can negotiate the market and make informed choices in relation to the goods and services that they buy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1088">The European Court of Justice issued a Judgement on 18 December 2007 in a case between the Latvian company, Laval, and the Swedish Building Workers' Union and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">The Swedish Labour Court had referred the case to the European Court of Justice to determine whether it is permissible under European law for trade unions to take industrial action, in the form of a blockade, to compel a foreign temporary provider of services to sign a collective agreement in the host country where the law of the host country implementing the Posted Workers Directive does not provide for the application of terms and conditions in collective agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">In its judgement, the European Court of Justice held that, in the particular circumstances obtaining in the Swedish context, action in the form of a blockade of sites constitutes a restriction on the freedom to provide services, which, in this case, was not justified with regard to the public interest of protecting workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">In reaching its judgement, the Court did point out that the Community has not only an economic but also a social purpose and thus the Treaty provisions on free movement of goods and services must be balanced against the objectives pursued by social policy.  In this context, the Court found that the right to take collective action for the protection of workers may constitute an overriding reason of public interest which, in principle, justifies a restriction of one of the fundamental freedoms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">The judgement, which issued relatively recently, is complex and is currently still being considered. It appears that the judgement is quite case-specific and hinges, inter alia, on the way in which Sweden has transposed the Posting of Workers Directive into national law. Unlike Ireland, Sweden has no national minimum wage arrangements.  Our view is that our differing methods of employment protection, including Registered Employment Agreements and Employment Regulation Orders, and the effective manner in which Ireland has implemented the Posted Workers Directive suggest that the judgement is unlikely to have any detrimental impact on Irish workers or our Industrial Relations legislation and practices.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1099">The number of employment rights inspections/visits undertaken in 2007 by the Inspection Services of the National Employment Rights Authority, or NERA, amounted to 14,413.  In the year 2006, some 15,855 inspections/visits were undertaken. This represents a reduction of 9% in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">Insofar as comparisons with the same period in 2006 are concerned I am advised by NERA that some 10,600 employment rights inspections/visits were undertaken in the period 1st January to 31st October, 2007. This represents a reduction of 28% in comparison to the 14,600 inspections/visits undertaken in the same period in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">There are three main reasons for the reduction in the number of inspections carried out in the first nine months of 2007 compared to 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">Firstly, NERA Inspection Services undertook a comprehensive and extensive employment rights compliance campaign in the construction sector during June and July of 2007. The nature of the Construction Sector in terms of mobility, places of employment (headquarters and sites) and numbers of employees dictated a specific approach from NERA Inspection Services in order to optimise effectiveness. This approach was resource intensive in terms of inspector numbers, planning, intelligence gathering and liaison with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to joint investigations and the exchange of data. This campaign necessarily resulted in the diversion of resources for a considerable period from inspection activity in sectors that would be less demanding in terms of inspection planning, liaison and duration. However, the approach adopted for the Construction Campaign was extremely successful. Some €1.3 million was secured by NERA Inspection Services for employees arising from breaches detected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">Secondly, recruitment processes and training plans had to be put in place for the recruitment of 59 new inspectors in line with the commitment given under Towards 2016, the Social Partnership Agreement. Successful candidates were identified for the 59 additional posts and twenty new inspectors were assigned during 2007. Again, this recruitment and training was resource intensive and the influx of the 20 new inspectors within such a short timeframe required a huge commitment from existing inspectors in terms of training, mentoring and other supports and diverted resources from inspection activity during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">Thirdly, there has been a substantial training investment in existing inspectors.  This investment will continue in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">Notwithstanding the reduction to date in the number of employment rights inspections/visits compared to the same period in 2006, it should be noted that the outcomes in a number of respects are extremely positive. Firstly, over €2.5 million in arrears due to employees was recovered by NERA Inspection Services in 2007 compared to €1.4 million for 2006. Secondly, 2,353 breaches were detected by Inspection Services in 2007 compared to 2,108 for 2006. Thirdly, 28 prosecutions were initiated by Inspection Services in 2007 compared to 8 for 2006. These outcomes point to the value of the more focussed and targeted activities being undertaken by NERA in relation to employment rights promotion and compliance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1115">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners of the following maritime drug seizures during the period 2005 to 2007. These are listed below:</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">March 2005: 4.5 kgs. cannabis resin seized from a fishing vessel (and follow-up search of suspect's house).</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">July 2007: 1550 kgs. cocaine seized in Dunlough Bay area (more than one seizure).</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">July 2007: 13.08 kgs. cannabis resin found at sea off the Galway/Mayo coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">September 2007: 261.2 kgs. cannabis resin found at sea off Galway/Mayo coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">November 2007: 60 kgs. cannabis resin found at sea off Galway/Mayo coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">In the case of the seizures made in the vicinity of Dunlough Bay, while the vessel that carried the drugs was not intercepted in this jurisdiction, the Joint Task Force (JTF) partners (Customs/Garda/Naval Service) believe they have identified the vessel that imported the cocaine as part of the investigation. Four persons are currently before the courts in connection with this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">In the case of the other seizures off the west coast, international enquiries are on going in an effort to identify the vessel(s) that carried the drugs and those responsible. There was a further seizure of 30 kgs. cannabis resin off the west coast in the past week. All these seizures were trawled from the seabed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">In addition, there have been several cases during the relevant period where the JTF, on its own initiative or at the request of foreign law enforcement, has monitored suspect vessels that have passed by our coasts in international waters. Some of these vessels were later intercepted with significant illicit drug cargos abroad. Intelligence has also been contributed to several international maritime drug trafficking investigations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">Other drug seizures were also made on land or in port, in freight imported on commercial cargo vessels; however it is taken that the Deputy's question does not relate to such seizures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">The Revenue Commissioners are acutely aware of the vulnerability of our coastal areas to drug smuggling. The Revenue Customs Cutter ‘Suirbhéir' was commissioned in June 2004 in response to this threat. Customs officials work in close collaboration with the Garda and the Naval Service to prevent drug trafficking by sea. Customs also participate in regular international Joint Surveillance Operations, which target the smuggling of drugs in maritime traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">Most recently in September 2007, Ireland and six other EU member states established the Maritime Operations &amp; Analysis Centre — Narcotics in Lisbon, Portugal. This centre has been specifically set up to further improve international co-operation in the fight against drug trafficking, particularly that of cocaine, into Europe; and I am confident that it will be successful.</p>

In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_1195">BreastCheck commenced roll-out in the Western Region last May and in the Southern region last October.  I officially opened the BreastCheck clinical static units in Cork and Galway last December.  The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in the National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years.  The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focussed at present on the completion of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1197">The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act.  Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with the Department's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland, which could merit the criminalisation of their sale and use.  The Act also limits packaging and labelling of controlled drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">The list of scheduled substances is kept under review on an ongoing basis.  In particular, the Department reviews any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health.   For example, in 2006 the law surrounding psychotropic (magic) mushrooms in their raw state was clarified in the light of evidence of increased availability and significant harm being done and it is now an offence to sell or possess magic mushrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is not currently a scheduled substance under Misuse of Drugs legislation, but its status is under advanced review.  Following a risk assessment of BZP carried out at EU level by the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), the European Commission has asked the Council of Ministers to place BZP under control in accordance with the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. If the Council adopts the Commission's proposal, Member States must act as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the date of the decision, to introduce control measures and criminal sanctions.  Control measures and penalties are decided according to national laws which in turn comply with UN conventions.  For Ireland, the introduction of national measures will involve declaring BZP to be a controlled substance under Irish Misuse of Drugs legislation and adding it to the schedule of controlled substances in accordance with that legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">The Council of Ministers is expected to make its decision on the control of BZP in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1210">Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly allowance administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The allowance may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child, as assessed by the Health Service Executive's Senior Medical Officer, rather than the nature of the disability/illness involved.  While no condition is excluded, children with conditions such as asthma, diabetes or epilepsy are not automatically considered eligible for the allowance unless there is a very high degree of additional care and attention required by the child compared to that normally required by a child of the same age.</p>

The allowance may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child, as assessed by the Health Service Executive's Senior Medical Officer, rather than the nature of the disability/illness involved. While no condition is excluded, children with conditions such as asthma, diabetes or epilepsy are not automatically considered eligible for the allowance unless there is a very degree of additional care and attention required by the child compared to that normally required by a child of the same age.</p>

To further safeguard the public investment it is also considered appropriate to underpin the contractual requirements with a legal mortgage  for the duration of the period specified for childcare use.

Dublin Port currently handles the vast majority of trade for the Greater Dublin Area and beyond and as such is of vital strategic importance to the economy. Some 79% of the State's RoRo (roll on roll off) trade and some 62% of the LoLo (lift on lift off) trade was handled at Dublin Port in 2006.

         if he will extend the period of the passport to 10 years and six months as travel is often refused in the six months prior to expiry.

            <p eId="para_1340">Immigration requirements differ from country to country. For the majority of destinations, including all EU member states and the United States, Irish passports are valid for travel up until the date of expiry. Some other countries, however, require a passport to have a validity of six months or longer for travel purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">The long-established practice of the Passport Office to issue passports with a maximum validity of ten years complies with the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and is in accordance with accepted international practice. Any deviation from this could cause confusion at border controls and could potentially cause embarrassment or difficulties for Irish citizens. I believe it would be very unwise, therefore, to change this long-established practice and, while appreciating the motivation behind the Deputy's question, I do not intend to make such a change.</p>

            <p eId="para_1411">My Department advanced funds to facilitate the payment of a bond on behalf of Irish citizens on one occasion during the past five years.  The funds were advanced on 25th June 2004 to facilitate the release of three Irish citizens from prison in Colombia in accordance with the ruling of the court. My Department, at the request of the defence team and given the very serious and ongoing consular concerns of the Department at the time about the safety of the persons concerned while in jail, advanced the funds to facilitate the payment of this bond, on the basis of a firm undertaking to repay the sum involved . The full amount was subsequently repaid to the Department. There was no Ministerial involvement in the decision to advance the funds which was taken strictly on consular grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">My Department will only advance funds for the payment of bail or a bond on behalf of Irish citizens facing prosecution abroad in the most exceptional circumstances, where there is considered to be a real risk to the life of those concerned and on the basis of firm assurances that the amount will be repaid in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_1414">A key objective of the Employment Permits Act 2006 was the strengthening of the protection for migrant workers. In that regard, employment permits are now issued to the employees and a copy sent to the employer. The permit contains a statement of the entitlements of the migrant worker including their remuneration, their right to change employer, and any deductions for board and accommodation, where applicable. The employee's permit is accompanied by an information leaflet summarising the principal employment rights of the employee.  It is considered that the current permit system achieves an effective balance between safeguarding the employment rights of the employee while not putting unnecessary obstacles in the way of employers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1416">The number of people on the Live Register at the end of years 2005, 2006 and 2007 was 155,833, 155,389 and 170,376 respectively.  The increase in numbers on the Live Register in this two period was 14, 543.  The Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.  Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, collated and published by the Central Statistics Office.  The increase in unemployment since 2005 to date is 9,400.  Employment has increased from 1,989,800 in 2005 to a current level of 2,140,900.  This reflects employment growth of 151,100.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">The level of redundancies in each of the three years 2005, 2006 and 2007 in Donegal was 504, 984 and 434 respectively.  As a percentage of overall redundancies in the country in these years it equates to 2%, 4% and 1.7%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">Despite past difficulties in County Donegal due to the demise of traditional industries such as agriculture, fishing and textiles, there is clear evidence that the county is successfully engaged in a transition to the new economy.  Progress has been made by the IDA in securing new high value investments from Pacificare, Pramerica, SITA and Abbott Diabetes with some 1,200 new jobs being added in the County by overseas firms over the last five years.  These companies continue to recruit and are actively seeking new staff.  Between 2004 and 2006, Enterprise Ireland client companies created 1,156 jobs as against 980 jobs lost with Enterprise Ireland also approving some €15m in support to its Donegal client companies.  The County Enterprise Board has to date paid out some €7m in grant assistance to over 300 clients, which has assisted in the creation of some 1,400 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">I can assure the Deputy that funding support and initiatives for enterprises in County Donegal is, and will remain, a priority for the State development agencies under the auspices of my Department.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the increase given by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to participants in the community employment scheme with an adult dependant pushes this category into the PRSI bracket taking most of the recent Budget 2008 increase back in social insurance; if he has had discussions with the Department of Social and Family Affairs in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1540">Increases for Community Employment participant grants are a matter for my Department and reflect the changes in the budget with respect to increases in Social Welfare payments. The CE participant grant increases are effective from 1st January annually.  In January 2008, the rates were increased by €20 per week for participants with an adult dependant, increasing this grant to €353.50.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">I am aware that, following this increase the grant is now subject to PRSI as it exceeds the weekly PRSI threshold of €352, making the amount payable in Employees PRSI is €9.06.  However, I should say that the aim of CE remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment where the employee would, in any event be obliged to pay a PRSI contribution.</p>

            <p eId="para_1544">I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">Joint Labour Committees (JLCs):</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) are established by order of the Labour Court under Section 35 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  JLCs discuss and agree terms and conditions to apply to specified workers in certain sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">When a JLC agrees terms and conditions, it makes proposals to the Labour Court.  That Court, on foot of a JLC proposal, can make Employment Regulation Orders (EROs).  EROs are statutory instruments which set out terms and conditions applying to specified workers in a particular sector.  Employers are then bound under penalty to pay wage rates and provide conditions of employment not less favourable than those prescribed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">JLCs are made up of equal numbers of employer and worker representatives appointed by the Labour Court and a chairman appointed by the Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">Registered Employment Agreements (REAs):</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">Section 25 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 provides that an Employment Agreement is an agreement made either between a trade union and an employer or employers organisation or at a meeting of a registered Joint Industrial Council, which relates to the pay or conditions of employment of any class, type or group of workers.  Section 27 of that Act provides that any party to an employment agreement may apply to the Labour Court to have an agreement registered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">Where the Labour Court is satisfied that the agreement presented satisfies the statutory requirements, it registers the agreement. The effect of this is to make the provisions of the agreement legally enforceable in respect of every worker of the class, type or group to which it is expressed to apply and to his or her employer, even if such worker or employer is not a party to the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">As the Deputy is aware, the interpretation of legislation is a matter for the Courts.  I am not aware of any Court decision which has established that there is any conflict between competition law and JLCs/REAs. As the Deputy is also aware, a review of the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002 is currently underway and in the course of that review, all submissions, including the matters raised in the Deputy's questions, will be considered.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1557">I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 to 123, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">There are many factors that influence a firm's decision to relocate. Firms adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology or other competitive considerations.  The result is flows of investment and employment across borders.  Ireland successfully manages this process, while winning many prestigious and value added investment, and enterprise policies have enabled the economy to replace lost jobs with others of equal or higher value.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">In circumstances where there is a more attractive low cost environment abroad, it will inevitably attract some companies that are unable to produce in the high-wage environment of modern industrial economies. Where actual relocation has occurred to date, it should be noted that this has been largely been limited to relatively low-technology, labour-intensive activities — those least suited to the economy that Ireland has become.  It is not possible to quantify why firms relocate or the actual number of jobs which relocate to lower cost economies. The relocation of businesses within particular types of industry is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland. While Forfás undertakes an annual survey of employment in companies supported by the enterprise development agencies, no data is collected on the number of jobs that have relocated to other economies or the reasons why. Neither is data collected on employment that is attracted here from other less competitive economies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">The last Quarterly National Household Survey on the labour market showed that the pace of employment growth actually accelerated slightly and employment over the year 2007 was up nearly 4%.  Last year total employment in the country exceeded 2 million for the first time, an increase of 78,000 on the same quarter in 2006 and net job creation in both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland was the highest since 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">The National Competitiveness Council benchmarks Ireland's competitiveness performance on an annual basis.  We have also had the benefit of the advice and views of the Enterprise Strategy Group, the Small Business Forum, the Better Regulation Group and have policies in place to act on their recommendations.  Together with our Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation and our National Skills Strategy, I am satisfied that we are taking the measures needed to meet the challenges of global competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">It would be entirely misleading to suggest that plant relocation or company restructuring giving rise to job losses, whether due to individual firm or sector challenges, indicate that whole economies are uncompetitive. Ireland is deeply connected with the global economy. Our success over many years in attracting industry leaders in advanced manufacturing and service companies has transformed our enterprise base. An increasing part of our economy is now sophisticated, highly productive and value driven.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">What establishes the competitive credentials of the economy is our ability to replace quality jobs with others that are of the same or higher skill level. There is also no doubt that labour markets are changing at an increasingly fast pace due mainly to the impacts of globalisation, immigration and demographic factors. We are responding with new policies and new opportunities for our labour force.  Labour market programmes play an important role by providing the skills needed for unemployed persons to get back to work while at the same time providing the skilled labour needed by employers to improve their productivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">The clearest demonstration of the benefits to Ireland from globalisation is illustrated by inward Foreign Direct Investment.  It should be noted that in addition to attracting foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland also places significant focus on embedding existing multinational enterprises in Ireland, by encouraging such enterprises to increase the scale of Irish subsidiaries, and to also expand the range of activities undertaken in Irish subsidiaries to include less mobile types of operations (e.g. R&amp;D activities, Supply Chain Management etc.). This process of embedding subsidiaries of multinational enterprises makes relocation less likely.</p>

            <p eId="para_1566">Employment growth, i.e. the excess of jobs created over jobs lost, is expected to continue to be positive in 2008, though growing at a slower pace than in previous years.  In the Budget Outlook employment is forecast to grow by over 1% (24,000) in 2008.  Employment has increased by 247,300 in the three-year period since 2004 and the number of people in employment is now 2,140,900. It is generally accepted that this rate of growth could not continue and the economy is now entering a period of adjustment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1568">The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 4.9% on average in 2007. The euro area measure of inflation, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), was 2.8% for Ireland in 2007. This was   lower than the euro area average for the same period. The Central Bank, in their Quarterly Bulletin published last week, forecast inflation (HICP) to ease further to 2.5% in 2008.  Inflation is measured by independent authorities in a public and transparent manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">We have no control over some of the factors influencing inflation, such as oil prices, the exchange rate and mortgage interest rates. The overall cost environment is an important factor important for business and investment decisions. This is why, as part of our economic policy, we seek to maintain low inflation, promote competition,  pursue a sensible incomes policy, and keep public spending growth at sustainable levels. Doing this will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness and to maximise our economic potential. These are all part of our strategy to improve the cost environment and to enhance competitiveness. Furthermore, the Government's last three budgets have been non inflationary as a measure to help the cost environment for business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">However, business decisions to move jobs or production to other locations are based on many factors and not just cost alone. Proximity to markets, consumer preferences and changes in technology are some of the factors which may influence location decisions of mobile investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1572">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE aims to facilitate unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.  To achieve these objectives, FÁS works in partnership with community and voluntary organisations to provide much needed social services within a community based environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment. The programme is managed in a flexible way  within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">The FÁS Board has not yet approved the detailed FÁS budget for 2008.  However, I can say that the Community Employment budget for 2008 has been provided with a view to maintaining overall numbers on schemes at 2007 levels.  Since 2002 the number of CE places provided nationally has been maintained at a constant level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">There are currently no plans for expanding the Community Employment Scheme beyond its current capacity due to the relative stability in the numbers of long-term unemployed and other relevant target groups for participation on CE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, the operation of the Scheme is kept under constant review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1586">In an increasingly knowledge-based and global environment, the skills required by a modern economy are progressively becoming more sophisticated.  Ensuring that the skills supply and demand are matched requires an ongoing commitment to monitoring current and future skills needs and addressing any gaps through investments in upskilling.  To that end the Government has made provision to ensure that we have the best possible information on future skills needs and the policies and training interventions in place to respond to them.  Central to this endeavour is the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  It has been monitoring developments and proposing responses since 1997.  That work has involved ongoing research into labour demand and supply in a number of economic sectors.  The subsequent implementation of positive recommendations made by the Expert Group has significantly contributed to the economic growth and job creation that we have seen in the interim.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">Last year I launched, along with my colleague Minister Hanafin, the National Skills Strategy report.  It is based on comprehensive research undertaken at my request by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  It depicts an ambitious vision for the skills profile of Ireland in 2020 and sets out the advances necessary to realise it.  The achievement of that vision should enable Ireland to develop a competitive advantage in the area of skills and ensure that we meet the evolving skills needs across the range of economic sectors.  The principle recommendation is on the need to upskill by 2020 an additional 500,000 people by at least one level on the National Framework of Qualifications.  This is an ambitious target and will require concerted and coordinated efforts between business owners/managers, the Government, the social partners and individual workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">We will shortly establish an Inter-Departmental Committee that will be chaired by the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Minister Sean Haughey, T.D. and that will include the Secretaries General of my Department and the Department of Education &amp; Science.  This Committee will approve an implementation plan for the National Skills Strategy and oversee progress towards the realisation of the important objectives to be progressively achieved in the period ahead.  In summary, the National Skills Strategy has provided a road map in relation to Ireland's future skill requirements and we are currently putting in place the structures and supports to achieve its vision.  In support of that national effort, and by reference to commitments contained in Towards 2016 and in the National Development Plan, the Government will invest approximately €7.7 billion in the continued development of Ireland's human capital over the period 2007-2013.  The Government remains fully committed to providing enhanced education and training opportunities to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, all citizens have the necessary qualifications and skills to allow them both to lead successful and productive personal and vocational lives, on the one hand, and find enriching work in a national labour market that is characterised by quality jobs, high levels of productivity and competitive advantage vis-à-vis our trading partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_1590">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The level of FDI in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world.  Today, in Ireland, there are over 1,000 IDA supported companies employing in excess of 136,000 people.  These include many of the leading companies in Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Medical Technology, Financial Services, International Services, Digital Media and ICT.  The challenge is to sustain, embed and grow this investment.  To meet this challenge, IDA Ireland is focusing on the development of its employment base into high technology, high value added and high skill functions, including not only high-end manufacturing, but also areas such as high-end services and R&amp;D.  The proposed investments, structures and policies set out in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and National Spatial Strategy are also vital in meeting this challenge.  I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by Government, together with the activities of IDA Ireland will continue to enable us to maintain the enviable position which we hold in terms of attracting foreign direct investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1702">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of my department by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  There are no statistics available on the number of complaints the HSE has received from landlords as a result of a tenant not using rent supplement to pay rent.  However where the HSE becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement to meet housing costs, the supplement may be stopped and an overpayment may be raised. Any overpayment of rent supplement incurred in circumstances of this kind may be recoverable from the tenant. It is a matter for a Community Welfare Officer (CWO) of the HSE to determine if an overpayment should be raised and recovered, taking into account all of the circumstances of each particular case.  Where an overpayment is deemed to be recoverable, a CWO will make appropriate arrangements with the tenant for recovery of the overpayment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1704">Maternity Benefit is an income maintenance payment awarded by this Department to eligible women for a 26-week period on foot of a confinement. Entitlement to this benefit for employees is contingent on entitlement to statutory Maternity Leave.  Under the provisions of social welfare legislation, the 26-week period of core statutory Maternity Leave attracts a payment from my Department — subject to certain social insurance contribution conditions being fulfilled.  Maternity Leave legislation also provides an option for a woman to take an additional 16-week period of Maternity Leave that does not attract a benefit payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">The Maternity Benefit scheme has been significantly improved, notably in the last few years, in terms of both the duration of the payment and the level at which it is paid. Budget 2006 provided for Maternity Leave — and thus Maternity Benefit payments — to be extended from 18 to 22 weeks.  A further 4-week extension was implemented in the aftermath of Budget 2007 — bringing the total period of paid Maternity Leave and Maternity Benefit to the current level of 26 weeks.  Under the Maternity Leave (Amendment) Act, 2004, the period of leave that must be taken before the end of the week during which the baby is due has been reduced from 4 to 2 weeks.  Also, the final 4 weeks of Maternity Benefit can now be postponed in the event of a child being hospitalised.  In terms of the level of payment, in 2000, the rate payable was the equivalent of €219.41 per week over 14 weeks — or €3,071 for the duration.  Maternity Benefit is now paid at a weekly rate of €280 over 26 weeks — or €7,280 for the duration.  This represents an increase considerably ahead of the rise in average industrial earnings. In addition, the rate of payment was increased from 70% to 80% of reckonable earnings, subject to minimum and maximum rates, in the Budgets of 2005 and 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">Some employment contracts may allow for additional periods of leave to be taken or for an additional top-up payment to be made above the normal entitlement to Maternity Benefit.  These arrangements are discretionary private contractual arrangements agreed between employers and workers and, as such, are outside the realm of social welfare legislation.  I am satisfied that the rates and duration of maternity benefit in Ireland represent a reasonable response to the income needs of women on maternity leave and can be favourably compared internationally.</p>

            <p eId="para_1708">In its conclusions on the provisions relating to the special pension for the self employed, introduced in 1999, the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) placed particular emphasis on Article 29(5) of the European Code of Social Security.  This section deals with the situation where the beneficiary, because of his advanced age at the moment the pension scheme enters into force, is unable to fulfil the qualifying conditions.  In such circumstances, the Code provides for the payment of a reduced pension "under prescribed conditions" to be determined in national legislation.  My Department introduced a special pension scheme for self-employed people, who were too old to satisfy the standard qualifying conditions for pension, when they became compulsorily insured in 1988.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">Accordingly, the views of the ILO Committee of Experts, which examines national reports on compliance with the European Code of Social Security on behalf of the Council of Europe, were sought on the conclusions of the IHRC report, and in particular whether the provisions of the Code require the payment of a pension in the circumstances, regardless of how few contributions have been paid by the person involved.  The ILO Committee has only just recently been in touch with the Department in this regard and has indicated that "Article 29(5) applies only to pension schemes "conditional upon a minimum period of contribution or employment", which, by definition, do not require pension to be paid in all cases, regardless of how few contributions have been paid by the person concerned.  This response indicates that the Department's position in this matter has been upheld.  The report of the ILO Committee will be reviewed at the beginning of April by a Council of Europe Governmental Committee of Experts on Social Security tasked with the interpretation of the Code.  The IHRC have been informed of the up to date position.</p>

            <p eId="para_1711">The current range of payment options offered by my Department to customers includes payment to a local Post Office, bank or building society account and credit unions that have been authorised by the banking and credit union regulators.  Customers choose a particular payment option having regard to their own personal circumstances.  The Department supports government policy which aims to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world class payments environment in Ireland.  Our payment strategy is designed to ensure that cost effective arrangements are in place for making payments to social welfare customers by using a range of payment options and to ensure that new payment facilities are made available to customers as they arise.  Currently some 50% of customers receive their payment electronically direct to their Post Office, bank or financial institution.  The remaining customers are paid by paper based payment instruments — cheques, post drafts or personal payment order books.  The replacement of books with swipe cards will have no impact on customers paid at non-automated post offices.  They will simply present their Social Services Card and sign for their payment in the normal way.</p>

            <p eId="para_1714">I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">Social assistance payments, including state pension (non-contributory), are designed to provide financial support for people who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension or benefit schemes.  Entitlement to these payments is based on a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need.  Accordingly, any resources that a claimant and his or her spouse or partner may have are assessed.  These resources may include cash income, property, or an asset which could bring in money or provide the claimant with an income.  This system of means assessment is designed to ensure that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support while those with larger amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">Equity release and other similar products allow home owners to benefit from some of the capital tied up in their homes, while continuing to live in them.  Sums of money raised through life loans or equity release are assessable under my Department's capital assessment rules.  Sums of money which are spent or disposed of immediately are not included in the means assessment.  Furthermore, as the balance of capital on hands decreases the claimant is entitled to have his/her means reassessed.  Capital is assessed as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">the first €20,000 of the capital is disregarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">the next €10,000 is assessed at €1 per €1,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">the next €10,000 is assessed at €2 per €1,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">any sum remaining in excess of €40,000 is assessed at €4.00 per €1,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">The sale of residence provisions, to which the Deputy also refers, are designed to facilitate certain persons who are in receipt of a means-tested payment from my Department in selling their principal residence for the purpose of:</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">buying or renting alternative accommodation,</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">moving into a private nursing home,</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">moving in with a carer who is in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit in respect of them, or</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">moving to sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative, statutory or private sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">Where alternative accommodation is being purchased the difference between the agreed sale price of the former residence and the agreed purchase price of the replacement residence, subject to a maximum of €190,461, is exempt from the means test.  Where no alternative accommodation is being purchased the gross proceeds of the sale are defined as the agreed sale price of the residence and are disregarded in the means test also to a maximum of €190,461.  These provisions apply to recipients of disability allowance, blind person's pension and those over age 66 years who receive a means-tested payment from this Department and they are intended to facilitate choice for certain people who might previously have been living alone or in unsuitable accommodation.  In contrast, equity release arrangements are designed to provide an income stream for older people and it is considered appropriate that these should be assessed for means test purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1728">The Review of Sign Language Interpretation Services and Service Requirements in Ireland report recommended the development of a service delivery model for sign language interpretation services based on a two phased approach.  The first phase is to establish of a new entity to develop and deliver sign language interpretation services and commence the piloting of remote interpreting services using technologies such as videophones and the internet.  The second phase is to develop and roll-out remote interpreting services.  A three year timescale was recommended for each phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">In line with the recommendations in the report, the Sign Language Interpreting Service (SLIS) was established as a company limited by guarantee in March 2007.  The Board of the new company comprises representatives drawn from the Deaf community, people with a background in delivering services to the Deaf community, from relevant public bodies including the Citizens Information Board, my own Department and the private sector.  Three staff were appointed to the new service, a manager, administration and booking officer, and a finance officer.  The service is based in the Citizens Information Board regional office at Tallaght.  The new service has been operational since the beginning of April 2007, providing interpreters to meet the needs of a range of public bodies and the private sector. SLIS processed over 1000 bookings in the eight month period to the end of the year.  An analysis of the bookings indicates that educational interpreting for third level colleges accounted for the largest area of demand followed by health and legal interpreting.  SLIS has recently established a website and will shortly be taking steps to initiate a pilot in relation to remote interpreting.</p>

            <p eId="para_1806">The Respite Care Grant (RCG) is an annual payment made to all persons providing full-time care, regardless of means or PRSI contribution record, but subject to certain conditions. The extension of the scheme to all carers was introduced in Budget 2005.  The Grant is payable from the first Thursday in June of the year in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">Details of applications received, claims allowed and claims refused by month, for the years 2005 to 2007, are detailed in tabular form below.   Differences between total applications received and those decided are due to the fact that some RCG applications are ultimately decided in the Carers section in Longford as part of claims for Carers Allowance or Benefit.  In addition some cases require further enquiries to finalise entitlement.</p>

            <p eId="para_1964">The Project referred to in the Deputy's question has been funded through the Community Development Programme since 1999.  This Programme provides financial assistance to projects towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres, which provide a focal point for community development activities and to other specialised community development projects and initiatives having a strategic importance. The Programme is aimed at addressing all areas of poverty and disadvantage. Projects are concerned with the needs of women and children, those with disabilities, the homeless, lone parent families, the elderly, the unemployed, young people at risk, Travellers and other disadvantaged groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_1967">As previously indicated to the house, the core objective of the cohesion process is to simplify and improve local delivery of programmes operated by my Department through the integration and alignment of local delivery structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">The appointment of the members of the Boards of local development companies is primarily a matter for the Boards of the companies concerned.  Given the significant public money dispersed through local development companies, the Department issued governance guidelines on the 1st of October 2007 that provide, inter alia, for a transparent selection process for nomination and appointment of members to the Boards of these companies.   Copies of these guidelines are available on my Department's Website at www.pobail.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1969">Where the company concerned proposes to oversee the selection process of candidates from the community and voluntary sector, it is required to work with the relevant Director of Services for Community and Enterprise to ensure that no Community and Voluntary organisation active within its catchment area and registered with the Community and Voluntary Forum is excluded from the process and to seek the approval of my Department for the process proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1970">I understand that the company referred to by the Deputy held community director elections in December in order to include representatives from across its expanded catchment area.    However, the company had not obtained Departmental approval for the selection procedure governing these recent elections because the selection procedure had not been certified by local  Director of Services for Community and Enterprise.    Officials of my Department are currently investigating the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2072">According to my Department's records, there was a total of 32 approved abattoirs in Co Mayo in 1998. In 1998 all abattoirs were under the supervision of my Department. Local abattoirs (or low throughput slaughtering establishments) are those establishments that slaughter no more than 1,000 livestock units per annum. In 1998 such abattoirs were only permitted to trade on the domestic market. According to the Department's records there were 29 local abattoirs in 1998 and 3 larger export approved slaughter plants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">The Local Authority Veterinary Service (LAVS), reporting to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, is now responsible for local abattoirs. I understand that there are currently 17 such abattoirs approved by the LAVS, and 4 larger abattoirs approved by my Department under new EU regulations collectively known as the Hygiene Package, which came into operation on 1 January 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">The Hygiene Package set out updated requirements regarding hygiene and safety assurance for food business operators involved in production and placing on the market of foods of animal origin. The Hygiene Package was transposed into Irish domestic law by the European Communities (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations, (S.I. No. 910 of 2005).</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">It is important to note that under the Hygiene Package, product from all approved establishments, regardless of size, may now be exported provided it is accompanied by appropriate certification. Thus, the distinction between local abattoirs, which could only sell on the national market, and larger abattoirs or so called export plants, was removed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">You will be interested to hear that I have recently announced an aid scheme for small slaughter houses and meat establishments.  Details are available on the Department's website.</p>

This Category catered for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May 2005 and where the land was leased out by the original owner to a third party during the reference period 2000-2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">The person named inherited a number of plots of land from his father, his grandmother and his uncle prior to 1 January 2000.  While the lands were leased out during the reference period (2000-2002), these lands were in fact leased out by the person named and not by the persons from whom the land was acquired as required under this category.    In this case the person named chose to lease out the lands himself.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">The person named subsequently appealed this decision to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who upheld my Department's decision.  A reply will issue to the Deputy's correspondence shortly.</p>

In the course of the ongoing discussions on the payment arrangements for REPS, the European Commission have very recently raised questions about the established practice of paying REPS 2 and REPS 3 farmers at the beginning of each contract year.  My officials have argued strongly with the Commission that the practice of paying at the start of the contract year is well established and one of which the Commission is well aware.  I made the same points directly to Commissioner Fischer Boel when I met her in Dublin last week.  My officials and I are pressing for a quick resolution to the issue, but until the matter is clarified my Department is not in a position to release payments under REPS 2 and REPS 3.</p>

            <p eId="para_2169">The Statement of Strategy 2005-2007 of the former Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources indicated that procedures would be developed for enhanced coordination and cooperation between the wide range of public bodies responsible for management of the coastal zone. This was in response to the increasing demands and pressures on coastal areas and their resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">A consolidation and streamlining of the Foreshore Acts has also been proposed.

            <p eId="para_2175">The National Coastal Protection Strategy Studies in pilot areas have been completed and studies are being extended into new areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_2181">In August 2003, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources commissioned the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) and the Coastal and Marine Resources Centre (CMRC), both of University College Cork and Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL) to carry out a scoping study to assess the status of Ireland's tide gauge infrastructure and outline current and future requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">The study catalogued all known tide gauge sites in Ireland and made recommendations for a new network of sea level stations to be established.  These stations will consist of tide gauges together with ancillary sensors to provide meteorological data. In addition, sites set up for tracking long term trends in mean sea level will also contain Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2183">One such station was established in 2004 by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources at Castletownbere, Co Cork and continues to be maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">Currently, the Marine Institute is at the forefront of efforts to develop a network of sea level stations to carry out tide gauge measurements. The Irish National Tide Gauge Network is an on-going development involving the Marine Institute and a number of organisations in the public and private sectors whose objective is to develop a permanent tidal monitoring infrastructure, ultimately consisting off between 35 and 40 stations. The project is currently entering year 4 of an anticipated 10-year program.</p>
            <p eId="para_2185">The principal objectives are two fold:</p>

            <p eId="para_2199">The Home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2200">Home tuition funding cannot be provided indefinitely in respect of children who have school placements available to them. A suitable school place is available for each of the children attending this centre.  Officials in my Department have  now written to the parents of the children attending the centre in question in relation to the Home Tuition Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2201">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government believes that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  This view is informed by advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the Inspectorate. An analysis of research — including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism — supports this approach too, while Autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method.  By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methods, including Applied Behavioural Analysis, the Government is doing what we are advised is the best interests of such children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2202">The Department of Education has supported the use of ABA for many years and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, the Department does not accept — based on research, advice and best practice — that it should be the only method used. While ABA can address certain needs — in particular behaviour — other methods, such as TEACCH and PECS are just as important — in particular in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of methods so that their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_2203">Hundreds of children with autism are integrated into mainstream schools and hundreds more are in autism specific classes.  More than 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country, while more are being set up all the time. A testament to the scale of progress being made in this area is the fact that the number of such classes has increased by over 40% in the past year alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_2204">There are a maximum of 6 children in each special class with a teacher and at least 2 Special Needs Assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them. A child can have his/her own SNA if needed.  Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2205">Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.  As I have already explained, the Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education have been working hard to ensure that all children with autism have access to a range of approaches in special classes. A number of years ago, before this extensive network was in place, some centres were approved for funding under an ABA pilot programme. The Government is committed to long-term funding for these pilots subject to agreement on certain standards such as appropriate qualifications for staff and the type of educational programme available to the children. Discussions have taken place with Irish Autism Action with a view to advancing this commitment as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2206">Other centres, including the one referred to by the Deputy, are seeking to be funded under the pilot scheme. However, now that a national network of special classes is available, new centres will not be brought into the pilot programme. We are determined instead to ensure that each child has access to the autism-specific education that is now being made available to schools throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2207">I would again point out that appropriate placements are available in local schools for the children currently attending the centre in question.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2221">The Teaching Council registers new teachers in accordance with section 31 of the Teaching Council Act.  One of the principal requirements for registration is satisfying the relevant qualification conditions, a process also known as qualification recognition.  Pending the approval of draft Registration Regulations the Council is using the educational qualification standards set by the Department of Education &amp; Science and the former Registration Council which were in existence prior to the Council's establishment in March 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2222">The process for recognising (assessing) qualifications involves the review of the applicant's educational qualifications by Council staff.  Where the qualifications have general recognition, e.g. B.Ed from Mary Immaculate College of Education, the qualifications are recognized subject to satisfactory confirmation that the applicant has successfully achieved the relevant qualification.</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">Where the applicant's educational qualifications are ‘non-standard', details of the course and transcripts are sought from the applicant and these are passed to external assessors for assessment.  The applicant's file and the results of the assessment are presented to the Council's Primary Application's Panel or Post-Primary Application's Panel as appropriate.  The Panel reviews the documentation provided and the recommendation of the assessor.  Where the Panel decides that the applicant's educational qualifications do not meet the standard required, the applicant is advised accordingly and given the opportunity to present any further information they may have and to have a second external assessment undertaken. If a second assessment is undertaken, the Panel further reviews the file and assessments. The applicant is advised of the outcome of this review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2224">The refusal to recognise an applicant's educational qualifications can in effect prevent an applicant from being registered as a teacher under section 31(5) of the Teaching Council Act.  The Council is currently putting in place an appeals mechanism to hear appeals from applicants whose educational qualifications have not been recognised in the process outlined in the preceding paragraph.  It is expected that the appeals mechanism will be presented to the Council for approval at its next meeting on March 10th.</p>
            <p eId="para_2225">Under sections 31 (7) and (8) of the Teaching Council Act, an applicant does have the right to go to the High Court where the Council refuses registration.  It is the Council's view that every opportunity should be given to the applicant to make their case fully prior to the possibility of having to go the High Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_2226">The Council and the Applications Panels are very cognisant of the impact of a refusal to recognise an applicant's qualifications.  The Council endeavours to be transparent in its dealings with applicants and give the benefit of the doubt where reasonable.  This includes giving Conditional Registration which allows the applicant to be registered and gives an opportunity to make good the identified educational deficiencies.  Notwithstanding the Council is obliged to maintain teaching standards and be consistent in its approach to the thousands of applications it receives.  Inevitably this will result in some applicants not having their qualifications recognised.</p>

My Department has sufficient projects with planning permission in waiting to advance to tender and construction and these together with the ongoing demands in rapidly developing areas are under consideration for inclusion in future announcements.</p>

In that context the Department has no plans in the immediate future to provide the accommodation on the site.   Accordingly, there is currently no agreement with any school patron to establish a school on this site.</p>

        <b>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b>

         if his attention has been drawn to an application for residency made in September 2006 by a person (details supplied) who has received no communication directly from his Department in relation to the application; the status of the application; and the date by which a decision can be expected.

            <p eId="para_2569">The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2570">The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2571">Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2572">While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2573">An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in September 2006 and an acknowledgement has recently issued to him.  I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2784">I propose to take Questions Nos. 188, 189 and 191 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2785">As the Deputy will be aware, in 2005 the Auctioneering/Estate Agency Review Group, established by my predecessor to carry out a review of all aspects of the auctioneering profession in Ireland, recommended the establishment of a Regulatory Authority to take over responsibility from the Courts and the Revenue Commissioners for the licensing and regulation of Auctioneers, Estate Agents and Management Agents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2786">In December 2006, the Government approved the general scheme of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill, which will establish the Authority on a statutory basis, and it is anticipated that the Bill will be published in final form later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2787">Clearly for the new Authority to be fully functional, it will be necessary for it to be established on a statutory basis. However, pending enactment of the legislation, an Implementation Group has been established to assist and advise on practical matters relating to the establishment of the new body and a Chief Executive designate, who is working closely with the Implementation Group, has been appointed.  While the Group and the Chief Executive designate are currently involved in establishing the basic organisational structures, systems and procedures necessary to any organisation, a number of specific issues, fundamental to the long term functioning of the Authority, have been identified which can be addressed in advance of it being established on a statutory basis.  These include the acquisition of accommodation for the Authority, the development of a code of practice for the industry, the creation of a National Public Register of Property Services Providers and the development of consumer information packs.  To date, significant progress has been made in each of these areas as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2788">Accommodation, which will serve the medium to long term needs of the Authority, has been acquired in Navan, Co Meath.</p>
            <p eId="para_2789">A Code of Practice, which identifies the key principles and values that should guide the day to day practice of Auctioneers/Estate Agents, has been drawn up by the Group and circulated to all licensed Auctioneers/Estate Agents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2790">The Code incorporates a complaints system which will enable complaints concerning non-compliance with the Code to be investigated.  All licensed Auctioneers/Estate Agents have been invited to subscribe to the code on a voluntary basis pending its establishment on a statutory basis under the proposed new legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">A National Public Register of all licensed Auctioneers and House Agents has been established and published for the first time.  This Register will be added to on an ongoing basis and will, once the new legislation is in place, include Management Agents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2792">Public information material on the provision of property services, including the purchase and sale of property, is currently being prepared.  It is planned to have this material available later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2793">Expenditure to date on the establishment of the Authority is as follows:</p>

My Department will also be asking Laois County Council to provide a report on the matter.  As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I am precluded under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement matter, with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2943">Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authority, in this case Laois County Council, which can take action if a development, does not have the required permission, or where terms of a permission have not been met.  Planning authorities have substantial powers under the Planning and Development Acts in relation to unauthorised developments.  The 2000 Act provided for a strengthened enforcement regime and increased penalties on conviction for the offence of unauthorised development.  Section 35 of the 2000 Act, as amended in 2006, gives planning authorities a new power to refuse planning permission, without recourse to the High Court, to a developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2944">The 2000 Act also imposed new obligations on planning authorities in the enforcement area: there is now a statutory obligation on a planning authority to issue a warning letter in relation to any unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development).  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued.  The planning authority's decision on whether to issue an enforcement notice must be entered on the planning register and, in cases where it is decided not to issue an enforcement notice, any complainant must be informed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2945">Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, provides, in relation to any residential estate containing roads, water mains, sewers, drains, etc, that if the estate is not completed by the developer in accordance with the planning permission, and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action against the developer in this regard within the appropriate period, the planning authority must initiate taking in charge proceedings in response to a request from the majority of the residents.</p>

            <p eId="para_2954">My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on lands such as National Parks.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls are carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.  Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of the landowner who may apply to my Department for a licence under the Wildlife Acts to cull deer when this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2955">The Road Safety Authority maintains records on the number and circumstances of all road collisions reported by the Gardaí.  While their database does not indicate the number of traffic accidents involving deer, the number involving animals (a category which includes cattle, horses, dogs, deer, badgers etc.) is recorded.  Latest figures suggest that animals in general are not a major factor in road collisions with 2006 figures showing that animals were involved in less than 1% of all collisions leading to injury.</p>

            <p eId="para_2958">Under the WEEE Directive, which governs the recovery and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), retailers are required by law to take back waste CFLs and fluorescent lamps free of charge on a one-for-one, like-for-like basis from householders.   Where replacement fluorescent tubes and CFLs are bought over the counter, retailers must take back the old product in-store, either at the time of sale or within a maximum of 15 days of the date of sale.   Where a replacement CFL or fluorescent tube is being delivered, the seller of the product must take back the old lamp on delivery of the new lamp.  Each local authority must also accept household waste CFLs and fluorescent tubes free of charge at its civic amenity facilities.  Retailers can have their premises designated as ‘WEEE collection points' or deposit household WEEE free of charge at local authority civic amenity facilities.  There are currently in excess of 600 ‘WEEE collection points' including both retail outlets and civic amenity facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2959">The determination of additional waste management infrastructure requirements is a matter for local authorities in the context of the preparation of the statutory waste management plans provided for in the Waste Management Acts.   It is a matter for the retail sector to determine the number of retail outlets from which electrical goods including CFLs are made available for sale and as a consequence the number of retail outlets where WEEE can be deposited free of charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2960">The recovery and recycling of all WEEE placed on the market since 13 August 2005, when the Directive came into effect, must be funded by the relevant producers, and is organised through two collective compliance schemes which operate a Producer Responsibility Initiative on behalf of the producers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2961">The WEEE Directive also allows for Environmental Management Costs (EMCs) which are included in the price of various products, including CFLs and fluorescent lamps, to fund the recovery and recycling of WEEE which was put on the market before 13 August 2005.  These EMCs are set by the industry-based WEEE Register Society Limited which has an independent Committee of Management.  This body is monitoring implementation of the scheme and has adjusted the EMCs periodically to ensure that the not-for-profit principle is observed and that the EMCs only cover the costs incurred in the environmentally sound management of WEEE.   The EMCs are not imposed by or remitted to the Government and my Department has no function in the matter.  The WEEE Register is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of EMCs and it is expected that this will be completed in the first half of 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2966">Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, provides, in relation to any residential estate containing roads, water mains, sewers, drains, etc, that if the estate is not completed by the developer in accordance with the planning permission, and the planning authority have not taken enforcement action against the developer in this regard within the appropriate period, the planning authority must initiate taking in charge proceedings in response to a request from a majority of the residents.</p>

Both the VFMPR and the policy paper on Next Generation Broadband will guide the development of policy in this important area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2974">In line with the commitment made in the Government White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, to increase the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) levy on the consumption of oil products, I have made Regulations under the National Oil Reserves Agency Act, 2007, which provide for an increase in the rate of the levy to 1.00 cent per litre.  The increase came into effect on 1 November 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2975">NORA has the statutory responsibility for ensuring that Ireland meets its EU and international obligations to maintain reserves of national oil stocks.  It is estimated that the increase in the levy from 0.476 cent per litre to 1.00 cent per litre will generate an additional €40 million per annum.  This additional revenue will enable NORA to work towards achieving the Government's objective, as set out in the White Paper, to maximise both Ireland's wholly-owned stocks of oil and the level of stocks held on the island of Ireland, subject to increased suitable storage availability and value for money considerations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3048">This project was selected for funding under the Broadband Measure of the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme, 1994-1999.  It involved the design and construction, by Chorus Communications, of a hybrid fibre coaxial network in Castlebar, County Mayo during 2000 and 2001 at a total cost of €1.3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3049">A technical evaluation of the project was completed by North West Labs Ltd, who furnished a completion report for each phase of the project and a final report.  A financial audit was carried out by Ernst and Young.  Consequently, grant aid of €615,627 was paid to Chorus in respect of the project.  The demand for services foreseen by Chorus did not materialise for a variety of reasons.  This project highlights the fast moving and risky nature of investment in the electronic communications market.</p>

            <p eId="para_3052">The Energy Policy White Paper and the Programme for Government underline the Government's priority commitment to energy research in line with EU priorities.  The Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy and the National Development Plan both reflect the vital importance of energy research and innovation to underpin the energy sector and the imperative to deliver sustainable, competitive and secure energy supplies for the economy and society.  Our ambitious renewable energy and energy efficiency targets in particular require a significant ramping up of research and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3053">Our commitment to building energy research capacity has already been reflected in the provision of €20m for over 200 researchers in Irish third level institutions over 7 years of which €7.9m was paid in 2006.  It is a key priority for the Government to accelerate Research and Development into renewable energy technologies notably ocean energy in order to realise Ireland's undoubted potential and to deliver on the national targets for renewable energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3054">In this regard, on 15 January last, I announced a major programme of activity, grants and supports to develop ocean energy in Ireland with significant targeted funding to go to the sector over the next three years.  The Irish Energy Council is completing its work on an Energy Research Strategy for Ireland 2008-2013, which will advise on key areas of priority for energy research.  I expect the Council to submit the Strategy to me by the end of March 2008.  I then intend to undertake a public consultation process before finalising the Strategy, following any necessary Government deliberations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3058">The roll out of smart meters, as set out in the Government's Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government, is a key component of the Government's strategy to improve management of demand for electricity and achieve greater energy efficiency through use of the latest technology.  The delivery of smart metering requires a collective response.  Therefore, at my direction, my Department is working closely with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), ESB Networks, ESB Customer Supply and the independent suppliers to roll out this new technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_3059">In March 2007 the CER launched a consultation process on demand side management and smart metering, which considered the technical, economic and behavioural benefits and costs of smart metering in both the Irish and international contexts.  On 5 November I formally announced the national smart metering programme, coinciding with the publication by the CER of their paper outlining the results of their consultation process.  This paper set out the reasons for the CER's recommendation to proceed with the roll out of an optimally designed universal smart metering programme that will embrace all aspects of smart metering relevant to the Irish electricity market.  Measures initiated in 2007 were designed to facilitate installation of 25,000 smart meters in varied geographic locations as part of the first phase of the programme.  The ultimate objective is to complete the national roll out in 5 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3060">The paper also proposed the governance structure for the roll out.  That structure is now in place with the first meeting of the Steering Group, consisting of representatives from the CER, my Department, Sustainable Energy Ireland, ESB Networks and Customer Supply, and independent suppliers, having taken place on 10 December.  Under the oversight of the CER a number of Working Groups are also examining the technical aspects of the roll out.</p>

            <p eId="para_3067">The legal unbundling of Bord Gáis Éireann's transmission and distribution systems operator functions from its other functions is in the process of being completed.  Statutory Instruments numbers 760 of 2005, and 377 of 2007, transposed the provisions of EU Directive 2003/55/EC into Irish legislation.  Bord Gáis Éireann has established ‘Gaslink Independent Systems Operator Limited', a subsidiary company, which will have the responsibility of operating, maintaining and developing secure and reliable transmission and distribution systems that are both economical and efficient.</p>
            <p eId="para_3068">An Operating Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 8 of SI 760 as amended by Regulation 4 of SI 337, which must be approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation, is being entered into by Bord Gáis Éireann and Gaslink.   A Transfer Plan, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 9 of SI 760 as amended by Regulation 5 of SI 337, must be provided by Bord Gáis Éireann for my approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_3069">An interim board has been established and the senior management team has been appointed to Gaslink.  Permanent independently located accommodation is being prepared.

            <p eId="para_3075">Decisions on any necessary actions to be taken by the Department and/or the Commission for Energy Regulation as a consequence of any changes to the UK gas regulatory regime will be taken in the context of the publication by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), of revised proposals to the current regime.  The publication of such proposals is awaited.  OFGEM is the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets, which supports the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GEMA), the regulator of the gas and electricity industries in Great Britain.</p>
            <p eId="para_3076">On 10 July 2007, the U.K.'s Competition Commission (CC) quashed a decision by the GEMA to reform the gas offtake regime for Great Britain's high-pressure National Transmission System.  The principal initiative behind OFGEM's proposals was the creation of a "user commitment" model, requiring all shippers who offtake at a UK gas transmission network exit point to secure sufficient capacity to meet their needs 3-7 years in advance.  This would have resulted in a number of changes to the Irish market with regard to the booking of gas capacity from the Moffat exit point of the interconnector between Scotland and Ireland.  The decision is currently being reconsidered by OFGEM, having regard to the Competition Commission's views, and I am advised that revised exit reform proposals are likely to be published in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3077">In the meantime, while awaiting OFGEM's final decision, the CER, supported by my Department, has taken a proactive approach to this matter, and both are in regular contact with Bord Gáis Éireann and with our UK counterparts in relation to it.</p>
