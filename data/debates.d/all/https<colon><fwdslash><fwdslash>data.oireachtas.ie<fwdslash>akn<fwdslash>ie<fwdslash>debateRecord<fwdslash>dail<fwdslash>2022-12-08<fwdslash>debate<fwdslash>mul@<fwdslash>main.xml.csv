At various points during a meeting of the health committee, I asked about the total number of people on waiting lists. I am unsure as to whether that information can be provided in the format I want. I received some information yesterday, but it did not include people awaiting diagnostic scans or planned procedures. When will we see the multi-annual waiting list plan that was promised some time ago?
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	2	I thank the Deputy for his question. The 2022 waiting list plan is part of a multi-annual approach to reduce waiting times. Most importantly, it focuses in the first instance on long waiters to meet the Sláintecare targets. We now have three-year waiting list plans. A great deal of effort was made on waiting lists in the last quarter of 2021, which resulted in a reduction of 5% in the lists. It was a successful activity. That effort transferred into the €350 million waiting list plan for this year, which mainly focuses on hospital waiting lists. It also focuses on, and makes an investment in, community waiting lists. Under the budget, a significant allocation has been made for next year. The most important message is that, despite the challenges of Covid, including Omicron, the plan is working. I will cite a few examples. The number of patients waiting more than a year for an outpatient appointment has fallen by nearly 25% in the year to date, which is a large decrease. The number of patients waiting more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment has fallen by nearly 40% of the Covid peak in March 2021 and the number waiting more than six months for a procedure has fallen by a third since September 2020. A great deal of progress is being made and more is being provided for in next year's budget. Regarding a multi-annual plan, something that we are addressing is recurrent funding. Much of this year's funding was one-off funding. Through the 2023 budget, we have allocated approximately €125 million to recurrent funding. One of the permanent changes that are being made is being led by Dr. Colm Henry and involves approximately 30 initiatives to accelerate specific patient pathways.

For some time, I have called for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to publish all waiting lists. Currently, it only publishes acute hospital waiting lists. For transparency purposes, it would be better if community, diagnostic, mental health, children's disability network team and other specialised waiting lists were published so that we could capture what was happening. I welcome the new public-only hospital consultant contract, which will play an important part in making consultants more available in our hospitals, particularly at weekends and after 6 p.m. on weekdays. I hope that it will result in more consultants joining the system. Selling the contract and, in so doing, attracting more consultants into the public system must be a priority for us all.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	4	I agree with the Deputy's first point, in that we need a single consolidated waiting list view. Among other measures, we need electronic patient records to achieve this. Many patients are on many different waiting lists and they all get counted as individual patients. We are making a significant investment in e-health and electronic patient records. I acknowledge the Deputy's support for the consultant contract. This morning, I heard the public contributions he made yesterday. I thank him and his party. I acknowledge that other Opposition Members have also supported it. This contract is a core part of Sláintecare and is something that we are all behind. A united front in the Oireachtas is important. As the consultant bodies rightly say, we need to hire many more consultants. One of the ways to do so is for Oireachtas Members and the consultant bodies to back the contract and encourage consultants to stay in or return to Ireland so that we can hire more into our public health service.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	5	It is important that we welcome the contract and attract more consultants. In tandem with that, though, I have been hearing from consultants for many years that they need more access to hospital equipment, including diagnostic equipment, and surgical theatre capacity. We will ratchet up the number of consultants working in our public system, but many of the current cohort are battling as we speak to get access to precious surgical theatre capacity. This is an important issue. We need to consider consultant packages, by which I mean ancillary staff such as nurses, healthcare assistants and junior doctors, surgical theatre capacity and hospital equipment, including public diagnostic equipment, in which I would like more investment. There must be a plan to put in place all of this infrastructure so that we can get bang for our buck and have the capacity in our public hospitals that we want.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	6	I agree with all the Deputy's comments. We want to run our existing theatres, diagnostic suites and outpatient clinics for longer so that consultants and their patients can get more access to our current resources. As he correctly stated, this will require more theatre nurses, administrative support and technicians. We can get much more for patients out of our current capacity, which is why the new contract will gradually double the time available to them. That said, we also need a great deal more new capacity. Yesterday was a good day in that regard. There was Government agreement on two new elective hospitals and five new surgical hubs, including one in the Deputy's constituency of Waterford, which will make a significant difference. This is in line with a fundamental increase in the permanent capacity of our public health service.

Are we any closer to understanding when we will have that assembly?
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	8	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Government is committed to establishing a citizens' assembly on drug use at the earliest opportunity in 2023 along with a citizens' assembly on the future of education. The terms of reference and the timelines for the citizens' assembly on drug use will be presented to the Oireachtas for approval.I am very positive about the potential contribution of the assembly to the Government's health-led response to drug use and the strategic priorities for the remaining period of the national drugs strategy to 2025. Drug use affects all members of society, whether directly or indirectly so involving citizens in decision-making on drugs policy is, therefore, appropriate. I acknowledge the interest in the assembly among politicians of all parties and civil society organisations.  The Department of Health has commenced preparations for the citizens' assembly on drug use, in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach, so that there will be no delay in establishing the assembly in early 2023. I am keen that the voices of young people are included in the citizens assembly on drug use. The Departments of Health, and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have held a consultation with young people on how drug use impacts on them. The findings will be shared with the citizens' assembly when established. I would also like to see an international component to the assembly to facilitate learning from the British Ireland Council work sector on drugs, which I chair, the EU drugs strategy and action plan and the Council of Europe Pompidou group on drugs and addictions. The good news is that the citizens' assembly work has started and, hopefully, it will take place early in 2023. 
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	9	That is encouraging. I am conscious that following last night's debate on the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill, the Department of Health is having to do more work on that going into January. That is understandable and a good thing. I am conscious of the pressure the Department is under but this is something we feel must be brought forward as early as possible. The work of the national drugs strategy that would complement the health-led approach to drug use and, ultimately, decriminalisation of the drug user is important. Initiatives such as the national injecting centre in Dublin city centre need to be delivered. That has to be moved forward. I acknowledge that we are waiting for the decision from An Bord Pleanála on that. These are the services that we need. We need a citizens' assembly, legislation and policies but we need the resources and services like this to be in place. I welcome the commitment that it will be as early as possible in the new year.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	10	There is an An Bord Pleanála appeal on the supervised injection facility in Merchants Quay. We hope it will be taken as quickly as possible. It is part of the overall national drug strategy. I am very fortunate as Minister of State to have the national drugs strategy to which there has been more than 20,000 submissions. It has had its mid-term review. That is about reducing harm and supporting recovery and is a health-led approach. The Department has commenced preparation for a citizens' assembly on drug use and discussions regarding the national oversight committee for the national drugs strategy. Officials from the Department of Health have engaged with counterparts in the Department of Children, Equality, Diversity, Integration and Youth and are gathering the perspectives of young people on how drug use affects them, their families and communities. That will be provided to the citizens’ assembly on drug use. The programme for Government includes a commitment to convene a citizens’ assembly relating to drug use. A lot of work has gone on and I look forward to that citizens' assembly taking place early in the new year.
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	11	Last week's two-hour debate included many examples, stories and emotive words on this. This question is not replaying that but is a demonstration that we are continuing to push this until it is delivered beyond the citizens’ assembly. The work of Deputy Ó Ríordáin on this especially is to be commended. Public opinion is with this. When speaking to families, communities and people impacted by this, they know the direction of travel and they want to see politicians on all sides of this House support it. There is a Minister of State with responsibility for drugs but they would also greatly appreciate it if the Minister would speak on it and lead at senior ministerial level. We look forward to progress on this early in 2023.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	12	I thank the Deputy for his informed and measured remarks. The Government is committed to a health-led approach for those in possession of drugs for personal use through the health diversion programme that will divert them away from the criminal justice system and connect them with health services. The terms of reference for the citizens’ assembly will be a matter for the Oireachtas to agree. We need to meet the diverse health needs of people who use drugs and how to prevent harmful impact of drugs on families and communities. It is important to have an international component to the citizens’ assembly so that there is an exchange of good practice from the British Ireland Council work sector on drugs and the EU drugs strategy and action plan. We are examining alternative approaches to coercive sanctions. We have come a long way. Again, I thank everyone who has worked so hard on the national drugs strategy. It is my roadmap until we discuss these issues at the citizens’ assembly.

I very much hope that since submitting the question that there have been positive developments. I look forward to the Minister’s response. It is important that we value public healthcare workers. When pay increases are put in place, they should be delivered quickly. The same is true of the pandemic bonus payment. People should not be waiting. I hope that since I submitted this question that there has been progress.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	14	I thank the Deputy for raising this. We agree. I am keen that all pay adjustments due under Building Momentum are paid to HSE and section 38 staff as soon as possible, with retrospective application to the appropriate date. As he will be aware, all public servants, including HSE staff and section 38 staff, are entitled to pay adjustments due under Building Momentum, along with relevant claims that were resolved under the sectoral bargaining process. I can confirm that my Department has issued pay circulars and consolidated salary scales for all agreed pay adjustments due under Building Momentum in 2022. The circulars instruct the HSE, and other State bodies that fall under the aegis of this Department, to implement these adjustments.  The HSE has advised departmental officials that due to the complex nature of the adjustments being made, and added complexities with payroll systems, half the adjustments due will be made before Christmas with the rest made early in the new year. The cost-of-living increase of 3% and February adjustment of 1% will be prioritised. The HSE has issued correspondence to all staff advising on expected timelines for the payment of all pay adjustments. The HSE has advised staff that HR personnel will communicate locally, ensuring that all staff are aware of how the pay adjustments will be made between now and the end of March 2023. All adjustments due will receive retrospective application to the appropriate date.

Many workers in nursing homes and elsewhere have also not received their pandemic bonus payment, albeit they are not public sector workers. This speaks to the issue of the need for an integrated financial management system and an integrated IT system so that we do not have these complicated systems that do not allow us to move quickly. Most workers would have had an expectation when they heard there is a new pay agreement due in October and other Departments have been able to pay this. It is once again in the health sector where staff are waiting and some will have to wait until after Christmas. It is unacceptable. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has been lobbying all of us on this because it represents its members and it wants them to get the payments due to them. We are coming up to Christmas. That half of them have not received their payments and will have to wait until the new year, even if the payment is retrospective, is not the way to treat those who work in our healthcare system.

It is frustrating for the staff, first, and for the Government and all of us as public representatives. It is not for any lack of will on the part of the HSE or the Department. As the Deputy correctly pointed out, unfortunately, we have outdated legacy systems, including for payroll. A new process is being put in place. One of the first places we are applying it is to the non-consultant hospital doctors to get rid of the situation where they were paying emergency tax every time they rotated. They will be a priority.It is good to point out that while about half will be paid before Christmas, the other half will be paid after Christmas, into the new year. The amounts involved are significant. In my response, I asked for two worked examples, namely for a staff nurse and a clinical nurse manager, just to give a sense of the amounts due, including the arrears. I will mention those in a supplementary response.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	17	The Minister will accept that a 3% increase is modest. It is welcome and deserved by workers but we are in the throes of a cost-of-living crisis in which inflation is running high. For many workers, any pay increases is just allowing them to stand still to meet all the rising costs and so on. A priority for all of us with an interest in healthcare, in addition to all the other things we are trying to get done, is to ensure we have proper IT systems and that, once and for all, we deal with all the legacy issues. On children's disability network teams, we cannot get real-time data in respect of much of what is happening because of the outdated system. It is working off a database that cannot be updated because the company behind it has, I believe, gone out of business. A new one is being built. Voluntary and HSE hospitals have different systems. Even within public hospitals, there are different systems. We had the same argument concerning the Estimates and an integrated financial management system. This will require significant public investment and take time, but we have to collectively agree we are going to do what is required and do it as quickly as we can.

As we were discussing, the systems will become operational in the new year, which is important. Let me refer to the changes. For a staff nurse on point 4, the gross salary last year, excluding the premium and overtime, was €35,130. With the cost-of-living increase and the Building Momentum increase, that is now €36,684. Regarding the cost-of-living increase, the 3% that will be paid before Christmas, the arrears due to the nurse is €966, with a further €167 to be paid in February. That will be the 1%. For a clinical nurse manager on point 6, the salary went from €56,745 to €60,968. The sectoral bargaining arrears is €1,820, paid in December. The 3% cost-of-living element is €1,611, paid in December. The Building Momentum payment in February will be a further €201.

While the healthcare staff in the emergency department do tremendous work in stressful and challenging conditions, the promise of a much-needed new and expanded emergency department has not been honoured to date. When can we expect work on the new, expanded emergency department to start?
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	20	I, too, commend the staff of Beaumont on their work. It is an impressive hospital with an impressive team. In spite of the challenges of Covid, respiratory syncytial virus , winter and the flu, the team is doing fantastic work. I fully acknowledge that the new emergency department is important. The proposal includes a reconfiguration of the existing emergency department. Associated works, including road realignment, will also be necessary. The HSE has appointed a design team. While it is in the early stages of development, I am happy that the design report has been completed. It is only one step but an important one. The design team will continue through this design process, including planning. In parallel, rather than sequentially, we are trying to get these things moving quicker. The HSE is drafting the strategic assessment report that is required. I expect this to be submitted early next year to my Department. If it satisfies the requirements of the public spending code, a preliminary business case can be developed. Given the impact of construction inflation, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine, the capital bill for the project could be in excess of €100 million. It is a substantial build. If the requirements are satisfied, it will be a question of the public spending code and a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. When we have the strategic assessment review, we will be able to give a more detailed timeline as to when the new facilities will ultimately be in place for patients.

The people I talk to in my constituency every week, many of whom are elderly, tell me that despite the excellent work done by the staff in the emergency department, they are left waiting for hours in overcrowded conditions. They can be left on chairs and may not even be able to get a trolley. Elderly people who go into the emergency department in the morning may not get out until 6 a.m. the next day. These are intolerable conditions. Promises have been made over the years. The design team appointed in 2018 concluded its work in February 2019, and its costings are very much out of date. While I appreciate the Minister's response, people want to know when the much-needed new emergency department will be provided.

On top of that, admissions from the emergency department are up 20% on 2019. There has, therefore, been a huge increase in the number of patients coming in and the complexity of their care needs. A 20% increase since 2019 is huge. It underscores the Deputy's point, which is that new capacity is required. While the main project is going through the process associated with the public spending code, enabling works are taking place, including the relocation of the existing administration accommodation. Refurbishment is proposed for Rockfield House, St. Anne's and Beaumont house. The design stage for the enabling project is progressing along with the planning application, and various control works are being undertaken on the site.

When the hospital and its emergency department opened, the population in the area was much smaller. There has been significant growth in the population of the catchment area of Beaumont over the years, and that is one reason the works are very much overdue. They need to be progressed as quickly as possible as one element of the infrastructure needed at the hospital. It is important. The conditions, mainly affecting older people, can be intolerable. Patients tell me the hospital is the last place they want to be when sick; that it involves a trial of endurance; and that even young, fit, able people put into those conditions would find it difficult. I urge the Minister to make progress on this as quickly as possible.

I intend to make funding available to continue with the work in the capital plan for next year. As projects progress and we move through the various stages, the costs involved increase, as the Deputy will be aware. In the short term, before the new development is in place, we are making available many more resources for the emergency team. There are more emergency medicine consultants, healthcare assistants and nurses, and also more emergency medicine. Additional beds have been made available. We are finding that the most important thing we put into the emergency department is not capacity but discharge options for patients. Despite the many millions of additional euro being invested in home care, the approval of many more home care packages and the investment in nursing homes and step-down facilities, the delayed discharge level is still higher than we want it to be. The most important thing we are doing probably is working with the community to discharge patients, freeing up the beds for patients admitted to the emergency department.

#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	26	I thank Deputy Ward for his question. The Deputy will be aware that the Mental Health Commission is an independent statutory body established under the Mental Health Act 2001. The commission’s principal functions are to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres under the Act. As the Mental Health Commission is an independent body, and in light of the fact that the commission has not completed its final review, the specific issues raised by the Deputy are, in the first instance, a matter for detailed consideration by the Mental Health Commission and the Health Service Executive. Any actions arising by the commission will, in the first instance, be raised by the Mental Health Commission with the HSE. I understand the commission has completed a review of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in five community health organisations, CHOs, with four to be completed, and one of those four has already commenced. As is normally the case with relevant Mental Health Commission inspections and reports, any commission concerns brought to the attention of the HSE are addressed directly by the executive. I met with the Mental Health Commission in the past month and it told me it had raised concerns with the HSE in relation to matters that had been raised during the audit of the five CHOs. I look forward to receiving the reports from the Mental Health Commission when they are completed and formally submitted to me. To date, I have not received anything in writing. The Deputy will be aware that the independent report of the review of care provided by south Kerry CAMHS, the Maskey report, made findings regarding significant failures across multiple levels of the system. This has led to an independent audit by the HSE and a subsequent review by the Mental Health Commission.
#MarkWard	unknown-#MarkWard-party	unknown-#MarkWard-dob	unknown-#MarkWard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	27	I am extremely troubled to find out that the concerns escalated by the Mental Health Commission to the HSE have not been conveyed to the Minister of State. This is extremely worrying. We are having these reviews because 240 children were placed at risk of significant harm and 46 children and young people experienced significant harm, including weight gain, sedation, elevated blood pressure and the production of breast milk. It is worrying and troublesome that the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health has not been given the information the Mental Health Commission provided to the HSE. The word "escalated" sounds worrying. The Mental Health Commission escalated this to the HSE but the HSE has not escalated this to the Minister of State. Will the Minister of State look into this to find out why she has not been given this information?
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	28	To be fair, when the initial report from Dr. Seán Maskey was presented to me I acted quickly and promptly. I initiated an independent audit by the HSE of three particular areas, namely, prescribing, standard operation procedures and the interaction of parents and families with CAMHS. The Mental Health Commission also agreed to conduct a full review of all nine CHOs. The standard operating procedure is that the Mental Health Commission must, in the first instance, raise any issues with the HSE, which is providing the services. I look forward to receiving these reports because I believe we will get data we have never had previously. We will able to look at all 73 CAMHS teams to see what has to be changed to ensure children are safe in these services.
#MarkWard	unknown-#MarkWard-party	unknown-#MarkWard-dob	unknown-#MarkWard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	29	I acknowledge the Minister of State's response to the Maskey report and how quickly she acted. I also acknowledge that three reviews are being done by the HSE and one by the Mental Health Commission. It is very welcome to have these reviews done. We must remember, however, that before these additional concerns were escalated, there were red flags all over CAMHS. The Linn Dara CAMHS service was supposed to reopen in September and that still has not happened. Inpatient capacity is lower now than it was when the Government took office. Some 4,000 children are waiting on appointments with CAMHS, a 32% increase on the figure for 2021. There are also thousands of children who, despite being referred into CAMHS by a medical practitioner, are deemed ineligible for referral. I hope those children are part of these reviews. A consultant psychiatrist has still to be hired in south Kerry where children are receiving consultations from a doctor in the United Arab Emirates. Children are still facing a cliff edge when they reach the age of 18 and are moved into adult mental health services, despite the recommendation in Sláintecare and A Vision for Change that the age be extended to 25. I am extremely worried that the Minister of State has not received the reports from the HSE on the concerns that have been escalated by the Mental Health Commission. Is there anything the Minister of State can do to get those reports out? Other people have contacted about this matter. Parents are extremely worried about what is going on in CAMHS.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	30	The HSE acts when it is contacted by the Mental Health Commission. Any safeguarding issues or concerns raised are dealt with promptly and appropriately by the HSE and the relevant CAMHS teams. At the same time, we must remember that thousands of children are receiving the support of CAMHS multidisciplinary teams on a daily basis. They receive good supports. I must try to build confidence in the service. On the Maskey report, the Deputy is right. Unfortunately, the post in Kerry south has been funded since 2014 but the service has not been able to secure a consultant psychiatrist. One of the key recommendations of the Maskey report is that services look to outside sources to try to provide supports. This is the reason services are being delivered online to children and young people in Kerry south. The initial consultation is done by a consultant psychiatrist, not online. Following the initial consultation and assessment, supports are then provided online as part of the person's care.

CHO 7 is highlighted in the question, but I would also like to hear what progress is being made in developing the statutory home care system, which I understand is being piloted? I believe this would achieve the sort of consistency we have not been able to deliver to date.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	33	In 2023, the overall budget for home support will exceed €700 million. Over the last three budgets, I have secured more than €200 million in additional funding for home care support, a 42% increase since 2020. I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for his support, and that of the whole Government and Cabinet, in ensuring this particular funding has been provided. I am in the unique position that I have the full provision of funding I need to deliver home care to 56,500 people every day. The problem, unfortunately, is that as of today, we still have 6,200 people on a waiting list. Their care is funded - I cannot be clear enough about that - but we do not have the staff to provide the services at the moment. Last year, we delivered 20.9 million hours of home care. Already, we are 6% ahead of target this year. We are seeing more people being referred for home care supports. The three main provisions to protect people and support people to age well at home are home care, day care centres and meals on wheels. We are doing a huge amount of work in this area. I am very concerned about the lack of staff, especially at weekends and in rural areas, when it comes to delivering home care. This year, I put in place strategic workforce advisory group. This is a very important committee that works across Departments. It also includes representatives of those who provide supports from the private, public and voluntary sectors. The group made 16 key recommendations and I have endorsed every one of them. The Deputy may have heard that last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and I announced the provision of 1,000 permits for home care workers from outside of the EU who will be able to apply from January. We know this initiative has been successful because to date more than 2,540 people have come into the nursing home sector on these permits.

I am interested to know how close she is to getting some sort of consistency across the country. The intent of the statutory home care scheme being piloted is to achieve consistency in standards and access.Are we in a position to plan for the delivery of that statutory scheme? That would give staff more confidence in the long-term prospects of a career in this sector. Will the Minister of State update us on whether we can move to that type of design? That would deliver across the country.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	35	We have been working very hard on the statutory home care scheme over recent years. We lost time during Covid. I would be the first to admit that. The Deputy is right that we need the same standards in respect of home care the length and breadth of the country. The interRAI, which is the single assessment tool, is what will provide that. I secured funding in my very first budget to hire 128 assessors, and they are being recruited at the moment. We have four pilot sites operational. The pilot sites started early last year. We had challenges in respect of staff. I have asked that the pilot be allowed to run longer because we need to get the relevant data in respect of the four pilot schemes. They are under way in Cork, Galway, Dublin and the midlands. I look forward to receiving those data. We want to make home care a really attractive career proposition for people who enter the home care market. The recommendations, which I will address in a moment, will help.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	25470	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	36	I need not remind the Minister of State of what the Minister said recently when answering questions about Beaumont hospital. The big problem is that we have a very expensive resource but delayed discharges because we do not have this service. I remind the Minister of State, although I do not think she needs reminding, that this is key to the efficient working of the entire health service.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	37	There are a great many home care workers the length and breadth of the country. To be fair, 56,500 people will receive home care today. Many will receive more than one visit during the day. However, we are seeing many more complex cases as a result of Covid and more referrals from GPs and public health nurses for people to avail of this service. The Deputy is right that if there are blockages in the community system, there will be blockages in the acute system. Two of the main recommendations were that when people are paid for providing home care, the minimum they be paid is the living wage, which is currently €12.90, and that they should receive mileage if they have to travel. I hope all these changes will make a significant difference.

The hospital charges the patient because the other end of the HSE service cannot provide the home care that is necessary. Will the Minister of State make it clear today that hospitals should not charge for extended stays where, through absolutely no fault of their own, patients cannot go home for health and safety reasons because home care is not in place? Will the Minister of State instruct the hospitals not to charge those patients? Where bills have been issued, can they credit those bills? It is not the patients' fault that they cannot get the care for which they are eligible and which is necessary for their health and safety.

I was not aware of it. I know that in my area, for example, there is huge provision of community and step-down beds and transitional beds for up to 11 weeks for people who it is deemed no longer need to be in an acute hospital and whose consultant has said they need only community or step-down care. As the Deputy will know, we are abolishing all inpatient charges in hospital settings next year. If she wishes to forward me any of the details of those cases, I will certainly have them looked at.

Is it possible to put in place a new mechanism to fast-track the process for the design, the application for planning and the building of new elective hospitals? This project, from the time the HSE lodged the documentation with the Department of Health, has already taken over 12 months for a decision to be made. I know it has to go through a process but from now on can that process be fast-tracked?
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	42	I thank the Deputy for the question. I was delighted yesterday to secure Government agreement on both those elective hospitals. I know Deputy Connolly has tabled a question on the Galway one. It is worth spending a moment to reflect on what a difference these hospitals will make. The Cork hospital, which, as Deputy Burke will be aware, will be at Sarsfield Court, will have nine operating theatres, a number of outpatient clinics and a lot of diagnostics facilities. It will employ more than 300 staff. Critically, because it will be an elective hospital, patients and clinicians will know that when patients are scheduled, those surgeries, procedures, appointments and scans will happen and will not be pushed out by emergencies coming through the emergency department. There will be about 180,000 healthcare events in the hospital in any given year, about 44,000 day-case and minor operations, about 23,000 endoscopy procedures and about 76,000 outpatient diagnostics and treatments. That is equivalent to about 600 patients a day, every day, and will make a major difference. The question Deputy Burke poses is exactly the one I have been posing. We are working on it and it has taken time to get to where we are now. Unfortunately, that is because of the public spending code. There are, I think, 17 steps involved. I was looking this up this morning in preparation for these questions. There are 15, 16 or 17 steps. It takes a very long time. We know this was put in place after the national children's hospital cost overrun in order that we could manage the risks in respect of cost. The plan is that we would have the two hospitals in Cork and Galway open with patients in them by the end of 2027, five years from now. As part of the agreement yesterday, I have requested, and the Government has agreed, that my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform work together to find additional opportunities to speed the process up.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	43	I very much welcome the decision. The Cork site is the right one. The fact that it is over 100 acres means that even if it is started with a small step, there can be expansion in the next ten, 15 or 20 years. I therefore very much welcome the decision by the Minister and the Cabinet. However, the issues are how long it will take to get a design done, then go through the planning process and then go out for tender to get the builders in. It is important we try to speed this process up. It should be remembered that the population of the Cork area has gone up by 170,000 in the past 25 years. That is a huge increase without any increase in real terms in hospital facilities. That is the reason this issue needs to be prioritised and delivered at a very fast pace in order to cater for the demands on services in the area.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	44	I fully agree. If we think through what is required now, while five years seems like a very long time, and, obviously, we would love these facilities to be in place tomorrow, tendering for detailed design, the detailed design itself, securing planning, tendering for construction, the construction itself and then commissioning, unfortunately, take quite a bit of time. One of the advantages we have on both sites is that it is our land and we are not looking to take private land with any complexities that might entail. Critically, as the Deputy said, one of the attractive features of this site is that we have an awful lot of room to expand. As he will be aware, what was agreed yesterday is phase 1, which is the day-case element. There is an agreement that the design will incorporate both phases, which would include an inpatient facility as well.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	45	I welcome that, but there is also a need at a very early stage for the HSE to engage with the local community. Sometimes the way we do planning is such that incorrect information gets out. I ask that this be taken on board because I do not want any delay on this. It is important that we work with the local community in Glanmire as well. There has been a huge increase in population in the area and it is important there is that engagement. However, we must fast-track this project for the benefit not only of all people in Cork but also everyone in Munster.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	46	I fully agree. I will add two points to that.The other thing we secured agreement on yesterday was five new surgical hubs. These are based on the Reeves day surgery centre in Tallaght hospital, which has been successful. It consists of four operating theatres for day cases only. It has not been fully open for two years, yet Tallaght hospital has seen a 58% reduction in its day case list over that period. Believe it or not, the number of patients waiting more than three months for day case surgery in Tallaght has fallen over 90% since the Reeves day surgery centre was opened. Cork will get one of these centres, as will Galway, Waterford and Limerick, and there will be a second one in Dublin. Critically, based on how long it took Tallaght, we believe we can have patients in these centres within 18 months, which will help. A lot of extra investment is required in healthcare in Cork. A really nice investment in the Mercy hospital is coming on line, while Cork University Hospital has five large and important capital investment projects that we are looking to prioritise.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	25470	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	47	I know €450 million has been set aside for next year to address waiting lists. What can this deliver in terms of the number of procedures? In respect of interventions delayed during Covid being prioritised, how will that work?
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	48	A very large amount of money, €443 million, has been allocated. The figure for this year is €350 million, while there was a lower figure in quarter 4 of last year. All of this is beginning to accelerate and provide improvements for patients. Of the €443 million for next year, €123 million is recurrent funding being sought to improve and speed up various patient pathways. Dr. Colm Henry, the chief clinical officer, is taking the lead on those. There is €240 million to continue tackling the waiting list backlogs. This includes funding for the NTPF and it is making very good progress. There will be additional and one-off funding for the HSE to use across the country. Part of the remaining €80 million will be used to ensure access to the diagnostics scheme increases. This has been a really successful scheme. Last year, we allocated €25 million. It was the first time GPs had direct access to diagnostics for their patients. We got very positive feedback from GPs. I think 138,000 scans were done with that €25 million. This year, we have increased the allocation to €35 million. My understanding is that we will exceed 200,000 scans this year, again keeping pressure off hospitals and emergency departments. The figure will increase to €47 million next year so in two years, we will have gone from zero to €25 million to €35 million and then €47 million. This gives a sense of the scale of the money and how it is being deployed.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	25470	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	49	I know the NTPF has tended to prioritise certain high-volume procedures. Will the resources be concentrated on those or can we expect the NTPF to extend the procedure list? How is it proposed by Dr. Colm Henry or others to identify the delayed interventions that occurred during Covid and have no doubt resulted in a need to reassess the priority of different patients on the list? Will there be a process to ensure that with this money, we get to the patients with the greatest priority?
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	50	The NTPF is working very well. We funded it to provide treatment for any patient waiting more than six months for up to 15 high-volume procedures. That will increase to 20 high-volume procedures. I am pleased to note that as of the end of last month, 80% of patients waiting for more than six months for these procedures have been authorised for NTPF treatment. It is going very well. How are the bottlenecks in patient flow being identified? Comprehensive work was done last year and this year across the system. It involved going patient pathway by patient pathway and hospital by hospital. It identified bottlenecks at granular level. Sometimes it was additional capacity such as theatres or MRI machines, while at other times it came down to decisions that three more nurses were needed here, two theatre nurses were needed there and a respiratory clinician was needed over there. It is being done at a granular level to do what the Deputy alluded to, namely, identifying the bottlenecks and investing in tackling them.

I hope it is the start and part of the overall new hospital that is needed but in due course, we might get clarification on that. My question is one of five seeking clarification on the situation in Galway and concerns a cancer care centre. I wish to know precisely what the position is with that. I ask this question in the context that there were 51 people on trolleys yesterday in Galway, most of whom were in the accident and emergency department, and in the context of the options appraisal.

The national cancer centre is being looked at. I have had meetings on it in the past few weeks. It is an important project. As the Deputy rightly says, it is one of several significant investments in healthcare in Galway. We had agreement yesterday on the elective hospital. A proposal, which I support, is in for a seven-storey emergency and women and infants' block, which is actually the size of a small hospital. It is a huge piece. I have been discussing with the hospital team the need to upgrade the laboratories. The hospital also has a proposal in for additional bed blocks. An ambitious proposal is being developed for a cancer care centre in Galway. The project would cost significantly in excess of €100 million so we will go through the public spending code and the HSE capital projects manual and approvals protocol. The strategic assessment report, which is one of the important stages, is being reviewed internally in the HSE. It is intended that this report will then be submitted to the national capital and property steering committee as soon as possible. If that is approved, it will be sent to me for consideration. The Government is committed to ensuring the continued improvement of cancer services at University Hospital Galway and the region. As the Deputy will be aware, an important new service, a radiation oncology facility, will come on line in the coming months. This is a state-of-the-art facility with several linear accelerators and will be cost €56 million. It is only one thing that is needed but it will be an important additional service for patients in the region.

I have a small library in my office related to Galway. "Not fit for purpose" is the comment from former Taoisigh and Ministers. A letter from the hospital's consultants and doctors to all Deputies and Senators, dated 1 November, told us about the state of the hospital. They tell us the main hospital was built in 1956, while Merlin Park was built in 1954. They told us that 95% of Merlin Park and 64% of University Hospital Galway is not satisfactory, unacceptable and not fit for purpose. Given this context and years of asking for a brand-new hospital, not an elective hospital but a brand-new one, as identified in the options appraisal, there is now confusion regarding this. Regarding cancer care, the region has between 800,000 and 1 million people. I am concerned that we are going backwards. I am very familiar with these gates. I do not wish to be familiar with them but I must be. We are at gate zero. On the last occasion, the report told us that the national capital and property steering committee was reviewing the matter. The Minister's reply today tells us it is being reviewed internally. Will the Minister clarify this inconsistency?
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	54	The proposal is being progressed and is working its way through the various stages. The public spending code is a very laborious process. It was put in place after the cost overruns at the national children's hospital. There is a balance to be struck between managing the costs in the public interest and trying to build facilities as quickly as possible.I would like to see these things moving a lot quicker. I do not think we are good at putting in place healthcare infrastructure quickly enough. When it gets put in place it tends to be of a very high quality and capacity, but I share the Deputy's frustration. However, the project is moving forward and it is worth noting that a lot of investment is going into the hospital, for example, in the radiation and oncology building, as I said. There is a new 12-bed cardiothoracic ward, in which have made a €5 million investment. I met the team there recently, and the ward is making a big difference to patient waiting lists. It is true that projects of this scale unfortunately take a very long time and I think they probably take too long, but it is only one of several very big healthcare investments that are being made in Galway and the hospital.

A site has been identified for a new hospital within that. I welcome the fact that we are progressing with the development of an elective hospital. On 24 November I was told that the Saolta University Healthcare Group has made a capital submission to the national capital and property steering committee. Today, we have learned that it is not with the steering committee, and that it is with the HSE for an internal view. I appreciate that the Minister has a difficult job. Like other Deputies, I have taken the trouble to put questions to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. We have not even got to gate zero in the process. One question is undermining the other question. It is extremely difficult for the Minister to be on top of the stages of the process from gate 1 to gate 5 or 6, or whatever it is. We are not making progress. If we were, we would not have received a letter from the consultants appealing to all Deputies to act on a cross-party basis to do something about this issue. I have many other questions, but I will keep within the time limit.

The update I have received is that the submission will be going to the property steering committee shortly. I am more than happy to look at that. Importantly, I reiterate that I have met the clinicians and I have visited Galway a few times. I was there recently and we talked about various capital investments. I have met colleagues from around the House to discuss the issue. I fully acknowledge the strength of the case for a regional cancer centre. University Hospital Galway has one of the eight national cancer centres, and as has quite rightly been pointed out, there is a deficit in the capacity available for cancer care. It is something that we are very aware of and we are looking at. We will prioritise it.

He will know that the clinicians have done a huge amount of work on this. They are really busy people, but they have an expertise and they really care about what is happening in the region. The truth is, as the clinicians have pointed out, if you live in that region and you are accessing the cancer services there, it is not the same as accessing them in another part of the country. We need to bring equity and fairness to the situation there. That is why the centre is so important. What concerns me is the number of hours that are lost because the beds are not available for the cancer patients. I do not know if any evaluations or studies have been done on the number of hours that are lost when there are consultants there but no beds are available to bring the patients in. Appointments are cancelled, sometimes at the last minute, because there are no basic beds there for patients.

I would agree with Deputy Conway-Walsh's comments and indeed, those from the clinicians and the hospital that we need more beds and facilities. However, there is an awful lot more that they could be doing with what they already have. For example, the last time I met with the team not long ago, they said that they needed more diagnostic suites and theatres. I asked how often they run the diagnostic and theatre services. Broadly, those services are run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday. The first thing we need is not more theatres, but more theatre nurses to run the theatres that are in place for longer. In fact, it is one of the core points in the new consultant contract. We have to get away from running theatres, diagnostic suites and outpatient clinics from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday to Friday. It does not work for patients. Yes, we need more investment, but we must also put the question back to the hospitals and the clinics. Theatre and diagnostic services need to be available outside the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, and patients need to be discharged at the weekend, which typically does not happen, to free up more of those beds. That needs to happen as well as the additional investment.

The specific question is on the issue of handwriting assessments, and the broader issue concerns occupational therapy. I ask the Minister the steps his Department is taking to address the barriers to the recruitment of occupational therapists into the HSE, and particularly to address the delays in the provision of handwriting assessments for children; and to make a statement on the matter.

The Government is committed to delivering real and tangible solutions to enhance services to better support the needs of children with special needs in Ireland.  The current delays in accessing therapy services, directly related to vacancies across the children’s disability network team, CDNT, network are acknowledged. Work is ongoing by the HSE to maximise the capacity of CDNTs via recruitment campaigns. Funding has been provided for additional posts in recent years to enhance the capacity of the teams to ensure services can be provided. This funding provides for over 600 whole-time equivalent posts. The funding of these additional posts, including occupational therapists who can assist with issues relating to handwriting, is intended to increase capacity across teams and shorten waiting times. These additional posts are testament to this Government’s firm commitment to support the established CDNTs to prioritise interventions for children with complex needs.  However, the HSE is experiencing ongoing challenges recruiting staff across a range of disciplines to fully staff each team. The HSE continues to work to ensure timely access to children requiring occupational therapy services, and to reduce waiting times for these important services.

The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will know the lay of the land well. It concerns the reconfiguration of services in County Waterford. A constituent in Tramore was transferred to the Dungarvan CDNT. After making an inquiry on her behalf, first of all I was told that the child's mother had waited for a number of weeks for a reply and an apology was made. That did not surprise me because I waited a number of weeks for a reply. If you contact the office, you get an automated response saying messages will be checked once a week. The child in question was told that unfortunately, the CDNT manager was not in a position to confirm when the child, who is 15, will be able to access the service. The child was further told that they will be able to access adult services when they turn 18, in three years' time. I find it very difficult to go back to that parent and tell her that we are instigating a recruitment campaign to shorten waiting times some time in the future, when she has been told that her child will not be seen for services as a child and has to wait to become an adult.

The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is aware of the situation. I understand that she has met with representatives of CHO 5 in the hope that it can be resolved. She is aware of the issue. The Government is committed to delivering real and tangible solutions to enhance services to better support the needs of children with special needs. The current delays in accessing therapy services, which are directly related to vacancies across the CDNT network, are deeply regretted. Funding has been provided for additional posts. This funding provides for 475 whole-time equivalent posts. The additional posts are intended to increase capacity across teams and shorten waiting times. I will bring the Deputy's concerns back to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.

However, there is a persistent problem in the particular CDNT to which I have referred. It needs to be addressed and the issue needs to be resolved for the sake of the children and parents who so desperately need access to those services.In October of this year, a survey of occupational therapists in Ireland found that more than two thirds of occupational therapists have experienced burn-out as a result of the job in the last 12 months and cite lack of staffing as a significant factor. They are being asked to carry too much in terms of workload. There is a need for the Minister of State's Department to engage very proactively with the Department of the Minister, Deputy Harris, to make sure we are producing a sufficient number of graduates. The Minister of State needs to engage with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure people are brought in and given the proper work permits. We need to go into secondary schools in terms of career guidance and tell people there are huge opportunities to make a difference here while having a worthwhile and productive career. I cannot just keep going back to parents to identify the problem. I have to start identifying solutions.

The HSE is continuing to explore a range of options to enhance the recruitment and retention of essential staff across all aspects of the health service. The Deputy suggested there is a role for the Department of the Minister, Deputy Harris. I absolutely agree with him. We can highlight these vacancies but also the opportunities for young people. In addition, the HSE is working collaboratively with the CDNT lead agencies at CHO level to market CDNTs as an employer of choice in a competitive employment market. Each lead agency is responsible for recruitment of staff under CDNTs and is using a variety of approaches to fill funded vacancies.

I asked whether that is under consideration. My understanding is that the reimbursement paid to them has not kept pace with the costs of delivering that service. This is an extremely important community-based eye medical service.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	67	I thank Deputy Matthews for the question. One of the locations in which the ophthalmic service is provided is in our own constituency in the Deputy's home town of Bray. I value the important role that community ophthalmologists play. I am fully committed to the development of the community service to facilitate the integrated provision of eye care in local communities. As the Deputy said, the community ophthalmic medical services treatment scheme was established as a pilot quite some time ago in 2004. There are four practices across seven locations providing medical and minor surgical care to patients outside of hospitals, which is important because it frees hospitals up to do the more complex work. The treatments and fees payable were agreed nine years ago in 2013. The HSE has advised that a detailed evaluation of the operation of the scheme would be needed to see whether we extend it further. I am very happy to tell the Deputy that I am asking the agency to conduct this review in 2023, which I know is something people have sought for quite some time. The HSE's 2017 primary care eye services review group report outlines a blueprint for the future development of services in accordance with population needs. It calls for the establishment of primary eye care teams that would include primary ophthalmic physicians, orthoptists, nurses, technicians and administrative staff. A priority for this year has been the development of the primary care teams in CHO 6, CHO 7 and CHO 9. I have asked my officials to review the current fees payable under the scheme as raised by the Deputy.

It is welcome news to hear he has requested an evaluation to be carried out on the expansion of the scheme. I hope it will also include the payments that are made under the scheme to the practitioners. As the Minister outlined, it is a very valuable service and one I recently experienced. The Minister might have noticed the black eye I have at the moment. Many people have been asking me about it. I have had to tell them I underwent a small eye procedure recently. It really brought home the value of having practitioners, such as the one to which the Minister referred in our constituency of Wicklow, available to the community. The Minister quite rightly stated that people do not have to go into a hospital setting to have a procedure carried out. If we could expand this service across the country, it would fit very well with the primary healthcare model he has been so successfully implementing whereby services that are suitable and appropriate take place in the community setting. There are far better outcomes from it. It is far better for the practitioners and people working in those services and for the patients, which is our primary concern.

I hope the Deputy got taken care of. Areas covered include acute treatments such as inflammatory or infectious eye conditions, chronic treatments such as cataracts, pre- and post-op care, age-related macular degeneration, surgical treatments such as corneal ulcer surgery and eyelid injuries. The treatment fees are set out in schedule 3 of SI 274 from 2013. The fees are set at either €59.51 or €75.76 depending on the service. The payments were reduced in 2009 and they were reduced again in 2013. Those reductions were not reversed after the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, period came to an end. As the Deputy said, they are considered by the IMO and some of the contractors not to be sustainable. To that end, we will do a review next year to see whether there is an argument for a change in the fee.

I ask her to make a statement on the matter.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	72	I thank the Deputy for her question. The Government is conscious of the financial challenges faced by the nursing home sector and has acted accordingly. The cost of residential care to the State was €1.4 billion last year. We received approximately €350 million back from people who avail of the fair deal support mechanism. As of today, there are 22,613 people living in nursing homes receiving support under fair deal. The full cost is €9.45 billion. Private nursing homes received nearly 70% of this funding under their agreements made independently with the National Treatment Purchase Fund. I am conscious that small and voluntary nursing homes are facing challenges at the moment. In November, I announced the €10 million temporary inflation payments scheme to alleviate the pressures faced by nursing homes as a result of increasing energy prices. Private and voluntary nursing homes can claim 75% of year-on-year cost increases up to a maximum payment of €5,250 per month. I backdated this to 1 July. Therefore, a nursing home can claim in total up to €31,500 from 1 July of this year to 31 December. We will keep it under review. More than €145 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, since it was introduced in 2020. I have also continued this scheme for any nursing home that currently has an outbreak of Covid-19 and needs those extra financial supports to deal with it. Last month, for example, 72 nursing homes had an open outbreak of Covid-19. Substantial other supports have been provided. Since April 2020, the State has been providing free personal protective equipment, PPE, and free oxygen to the private and voluntary nursing home sector. The estimated cost is €72 million to date. This year's cost was €23 million in those types of supports.

We know from the Department of Health report that was just published that Ireland's population is ageing faster than anywhere else in Europe. It is important that we make sure services that provide support, such as nursing homes, are adequately funded. I met with representatives from some nursing homes recently. One of the issues that came up is that while the HSE is recruiting, some of them feel they are losing staff to the HSE from their nursing homes. The reason they are saying this is that the benefits with the HSE outweigh what they can provide.The other issue raised was that the majority of smaller nursing homes cannot compete with the HSE. In the fair deal scheme, private nursing homes are on an average of a little over €1,000 per week per resident but the HSE is on double that amount, over €2,000 per week. That has become a huge issue.

Does the Deputy remember, on the day we were there, the amount of work being done with the integrated care programme for older persons, ICPOP, team, in relation to supporting people to age well at home, nutrition and dietary requirements and the risk of frailty and falls? The HSE will always step in where a resident's needs are sufficiently complex that they cannot be cared for elsewhere in the community. The HSE needs to be staffed to deliver that kind of complex care. The average price per person for a private nursing home is €1,050 per week; the average cost for complex services in HSE hospitals is approximately €1,650.

At a recent meeting, I was informed that, by the end of 2022, almost 500 beds will be wiped out and closed in smaller nursing homes in rural communities. These are owned by the single owners, not the big companies. That is the biggest issue. We have spoken about this on several occasions. I know the Minister of State's commitment and dedication. When I met with the nursing homes, they said during Covid the payments were exceptional. They were happy with the payments and know the work the Minister of State has done but there are huge challenges. I know the Minister of State is aware of them. It is important we do not lose any small or private nursing homes because they feel they cannot compete with the HSE.

I am in discussions with Department officials to examine ways in which funding can continue to be used to support, where necessary and appropriate, those nursing homes not scheduled to renegotiate their deeds of agreement this year. We are also looking at an expected extension of the temporary inflation payment scheme. The Department's records show that 18 nursing homes have closed this year with a reduction of 514 registered beds. This includes two nursing homes with a total of 43 beds that were not active. Four nursing homes have opened with a total of 448 registered beds so the number of residents who have needed to move to other facilities will be lower. I take on board the Deputy's point that we are losing small and voluntary family-run nursing homes in communities where they are hugely important. This is an area I am focusing on.

I have raised this with a number of opticians locally and across the area. They are struggling to get enough optometrists; as a result, people have to wait longer to get a service. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to it? Is there a way of improving those wait times for people?

The HSE provides routine eye examinations and glasses for people with medical cards under the community ophthalmic services scheme. The Deputy is talking about the medical card scheme rather than private provision.

Okay, thank you. With regard to the medical card, the service is provided by optical practitioners who are contracted by the HSE. This allows people the freedom to choose a practice and time that is most suitable for them. Timely access to services is an important part of maintaining good optical health. While the schedules of private practices are beyond the remit of the HSE, the HSE does process the applications for reimbursement. The HSE has advised that while most applications are processed in five to ten days, some community healthcare organisations, CHOs, as the Deputy pointed out, have encountered difficulties this year. Delays arose in CHO 9 due to staff shortages caused by Covid-19 redeployment. This has now been resolved and processing time is within five days. The Deputy's question is relevant to processing but is really about patient access to optometrists. For that, we need to hire more staff and have more people available. The number of new optometrists graduating in Ireland has remained steady since 2019. We need to double the number of healthcare professional college places in the country. I have met with various universities to this end. We will feed this in to structurally address the question of whether we have enough graduates coming out in this area.

They serve the public with the PRSI scheme and so on. They struggle to get staff. Across Cork a half dozen optometrist posts are currently advertised and, for as many again, the advertisement has been taken down because they have not been able to recruit anybody. Locum cover is extremely difficult to get. Fewer than 30 people graduate from the one course each year. Very often, they are in direct competition with the UK for those people, so the pool of qualified people is very small each year. It is good to hear the Minister has been making inquiries about qualifying more people. Will he elaborate on that? We need to see more people being qualified and available to serve people in the community.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	85	There are two things. The Deputy's numbers may be correct. The information I received from the Department is that about 20 graduate per year. One thing that will help is that it is proposed that the standard eye exam fee will increase for medical card holders. That will mean more money will come into the practices and they may be able to offer more attractive salaries. The issue is structural; it is not a short-term issue. I want to see a doubling of college places for healthcare professionals. We are approaching it strategically and have been doing a lot of work in the background to figure out how many extra nurses, midwives and health and social care professionals we need across the board. I have engaged directly with some universities to gauge their appetite for a big expansion of health places. They have been very open to it. I met the excellent team in University College Cork, UCC, and it was a very positive meeting. Ultimately, we will solve these issues in the long term by providing about twice the number of healthcare graduates we currently do.

On top of driver licence applications, there are people with more complex conditions. The pandemic saw people having more screen time and that will have a knock-on effect. Demand is growing each year. There is only a very small pool qualifying from that one course. It takes up to four years to qualify so there is a greater urgency there. Is there a college that will start a course in the short term so that, in four or five years time, we could expect to see further growth? Opticians are struggling to recruit. The need is there from the public so we cannot wait for the colleges. People need to be doing the course already if it takes four years to qualify a person. Is there a way to get those courses started in the colleges?

As the Deputy said, we are not talking about a lot. We have 20 graduates a year and we probably need 40 a year, given the scale of what we are looking at. We are looking at nursing places moving from 2,000 to 4,000. The scale of the move from 20 to 40 should be able to be facilitated quickly. In the meantime, private practices will just have to look at international markets to see what they can do. However, I acknowledge that it is not easy.

I have deep, grave concerns about what has been reported on protected disclosures. The Minister knows what I am talking about. I want an independent investigation into these serious concerns. This is a matter relating to the most vulnerable people in our community. The information that has been put to us has to be investigated independently. I will make two comments to the Minister. First, there is no point in people conducting investigations into their own behaviours. Second, the staff need to be protected, as do former staff and families who are coming forward with all these stories. Please do not do a cover up on it. I am asking the Minister for an independent, transparent investigation into these serious matters.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	89	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 aims to protect people who raise concerns about wrongdoing in their workplaces. The Act provides for redress for employees who are dismissed or otherwise penalised for having reported possible wrongdoings in the workplace. In general, people who receive the protected disclosures or those who subsequently deal with them may not disclose any information to other persons that may identify the person who made the disclosure. I am, therefore, not routinely made aware of protected disclosures that are made to the HSE for that very reason. It is part of the protection of those who are making them. The Department has put in place policies and procedures for handling these protected disclosures in line with the Act. I recognise the Deputy has raised this issue on several occasions and the Department is aware of it.

The term “forgotten farmer” is used to describe those young farmers who had typically set up their agricultural holdings before 2008, who were under the age of 40 in 2015 but who did not qualify for the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, supports, as other young farmers did. Will the Minister outline his proposals to address that anomaly?

This has been a long-standing commitment of mine from the time that I was in opposition to the time that I entered the Government. I ensured that it was part of the programme for Government commitments, and I have been following through on it since. The Department has developed a preliminary outline of a proposal to provide support to this group. I was pleased to have the opportunity at the recent Macra na Feirme conference in Ballykisteen to announce details of proposals that had been developed to address the issue of. I am engaging with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, regarding the funding required. The details of the eligibility requirements and benefits to successful applicants for a scheme to support the forgotten farmer group have yet to be fully finalised and we are working hard to finish this work to open the scheme for applications. Many of these farmers have found themselves in this position through no fault of their own. They have spent a considerable time operating their business at a disadvantage and I am moving as quickly as possible to address this anomaly. The eligibility requirements and other scheme details will be made publicly available as soon as this process has been completed. A lot of work is going to do it. It is complex in terms of the detail, identifying the different cohorts and being able to step it out. There will be significant work in processing the scheme as well but our commitment is crystal clear to follow through on this. There will be a scheme. We are stepping it out and we are now getting to the stage where we are finalising it to open it for applications
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	92	The Minister knows that I have been raising this issue with him since his appointment and I acknowledge that each time he has indicated that he is committed to addressing this issue. However, it still has not been resolved and I would like to know where the resistance is or why we have had these delays. In February 2021, he told me that he was "fully committed to addressing this issue in a way that is fair to this cohort of farmers under the next CAP". In May of that year, he stated: "The programme for Government contains a commitment to seek to resolve under the next CAP the issue of support for this category of farmers." However, by December 2021, which was a full year ago, the language had changed. The Minister then said: "I have asked officials in my Department to examine options to address the issue of forgotten farmers both through the next CAP and also other measures." It, therefore, appears that even as far back as last year, the Minister was of the view that perhaps CAP could not resolve this matter. By October of this year, all references to CAP were removed. Why has there been a delay? Is there resistance? Most particularly, how much is the Minister planning to allocate for this scheme?

For many years, there had been no commitment to these farmers. There was no proposal, plan or Government commitment to address them and to making sure that a scheme was put in place to reflect the fact that they did not get a fair crack of the whip. I made sure when I came out of opposition and went into government that it was a programme for Government commitment and that there would be a commitment by the Government to deliver on it. I have been working that through now as Minister. There has been much work and assessment going into it to identify the different cohorts that are involved and to pull it all together. We are finalising the criteria and the strands around that so that we can go forward with an application process. However, let there be no doubt this is going to happen. This is a commitment. There is going to be a scheme for these farmers that has not been there before. It will be there, and it is a matter stepping it out. There is a lot of work involved in it and it is taking a bit of time, but it is coming. It will be there for them and rightly so.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	94	I will acknowledge that this is an anomaly that was around long before the Minister was in office. It is disgraceful that his predecessors did not resolve it. I acknowledge again that he has committed to resolving it, but for the farmers who are affected, he has yet to do so. I know that he has made statements on the issue in public, but we do not have the necessary clarity. There was no announcement in budget 2022 about how this scheme will be funded, yet, in January, just a couple of months later, the Minister leaked to the media that these farmers would receive up to €5,000 in a lump sum, as well as enhanced targeted agriculture modernisation scheme, TAMS, payments. There was not an announcement though in this year's budget either, but now we have public criteria. The Minister suggested that he is in negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. How much has he sought for the scheme? How much does he envisage that it will be worth to these young farmers who have been disenfranchised for so long?

That will become clear whenever we publish the application criteria and the detail around it, and not until then. What is clear at this point is the commitment from me to drive this forward and to deliver on it, as well as to deliver on the promise that I made to the forgotten farmers of Ireland, which was that if I got into government I would deliver on this. That is why I went into government. I want to be in government to make differences such as this. There is complexity to it and that is why it is taking time. The officials have been working diligently on it and it will now step out. It will take a bit of time once the applications are open to process it, because quite a bit of administration will be required to work our way through that. However, let there be no doubt that the scheme will be in place, and the farmers will at long last get recognition of the fact that they did not get a fair crack of the whip when installation aid, etc, was interrupted and taken away and they no longer had the opportunity to avail of it.

My question relates to the farmers who have not applied or had time to apply or have missed the deadline through no fault of their own. The Minister intends to reopen the application process towards the end of next year. Can he do that earlier in the spring so that farmers can have some payment next year and will not have a gap year?
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	97	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. ACRES is part of the agri-environment climate measure in Ireland’s CAP strategic plan for 2023 to 2027. It is a voluntary scheme whereby farmers, when approved, will undertake certain actions on their land for at least five years. It closed last night and I want to recognise the massive work that has gone into the application process by the farmers and their advisers who have worked night and day over the recent period to get their farms walked and their applications in. I also want to recognise the massive work that is going on in my Department and the team there building this scheme, administering the applications process, and the massive job of work that is ahead of them to step that out. They have done tremendous work. It is a good scheme, which has been popular and well received by farmers. Once again it reflects the appetite of farmers to be involved in such a scheme. I recognise that and thank everybody for getting us to this stage. There are two approaches available to farmers under ACRES, namely the general approach and the common approach. The Government has committed €1.5 billion to ACRES. It opened for applications on 17 October and I extended the closing date by two weeks until last night to give as many farmers as possible the opportunity to apply to participate next year. As the Deputy will be aware, we have allocated funding to provide for 30,000 farmers in the budget for next year so we will see what the numbers are after the closure of applications.  On the Deputy's point regarding a gap year, that is something I am conscious of and have discussed with farmers as well. It is also something I am reflecting on with our team as to how we may be able to accommodate that because for those who were previously involved in the green low carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS but who may not be involved in ACRES, that is a real challenge. It is a significant source of income as well as the contribution it facilitates farmers to make to working on environmental goods. It is something I am conscious of and will reflect on further.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	98	I also thank the Minister for extending the scheme for two weeks and I know a number of Deputies, including myself, approached him about this and he did take action. I welcome the fact he will review this. Farmers rely on income supports and on these types of grants to make sure they have a cash flow. If farmers who were in GLAS cannot get into this scheme, there will be a gap in their income next year and many are wondering, as the Minister knows well, what will happen to them. I understand they have a severe workload right now but I encourage him and the Department to consider opening the scheme towards the end of March to get the next tranche ready and maybe some payment could be made to those farmers towards the end of the year. That would be important. One other issue that has raised its head is that in the criteria for existing applications that went in towards the last week or so there were some small nuanced changes in the scheme. If farmers could get the opportunity to make corrections or adjustments to their applications over the next week or two to ensure they get the maximum return, that would also be appreciated.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	99	It will not be possible to open the scheme earlier next year because there are specific workloads throughout the year. This puts a massive workload on advisers and March-April is the key time of year for basic income support through the basic payment scheme, BPS, applications. We have worked closely with the advisers and their representatives on the window for applying for ACRES and on how we will do it next year. We have discussed that for next year as to when that period will be and it will be the latter part of the year to open up for new applicants to participate fully again next year. It does have to go year to year because farmers need to be in for the full year to be able to participate in all of the actions and to have the scoring done, etc. There is the issue of the gap and that is something I will certainly reflect on. Now that the scheme is closed we will consider any issues that arise and I will certainly take the Deputy's points on board and consider them with the team.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	100	No doubt from listening to farmers himself, the Minister does grasp that the important issue is that there is something done for people in a gap year so they are not just left in a vacuum. I also welcome his statement that he will examine any anomalies that arose in the process and in the criteria. If there is an issue, maybe farmers could access their application again over a short period so their planners could address the issue because it could affect the amount they receive. I have heard that from a number of planners in the past couple of days and rather than trying to reinvent the wheel or look for another extension, there could be a mechanism by which these issues could be resolved. As the Minister said, this is a scheme for farmers, and for the environment and it is very popular. He had to extend because there was demand for it and the planners were flat out, the farmers were flat out and the Department was flat out trying to cope with all of that. Hopefully this will be good for farmers. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating but at least farmers are engaging, which they always said they would do, and that is a positive sign.

I have been pleased with the reaction to the ACRES scheme. It has been well received by farmers across the country. It was a key commitment from the two Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Heydon and myself, representing three different parties, when we negotiated the programme for Government and went into government, to put a strong environmental scheme in place that would back family farms, provide income from them and enable and empower them to do significant work on ecosystem services and environmental goods. The farmers have responded strongly. I recognise again the massive work the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, will be well aware of that her team in the Department have done to get to this stage as well as the massive work that has gone on in farmyards and in advisory offices throughout the country over the past couple of months. We will certainly reflect now that the scheme is closed as to how we will step it forward and to continue to do the best job we can with it.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	102	Many people were surprised to learn that between June 2017 and February 2020 there was a decrease of more than 18%, or 200,000 cattle, in the suckler herd. Does the Minister intend to introduce further measures aimed at the destocking of suckler cows and the ending of suckler farms as recommended by the food vision beef and sheep group?
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	103	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I thank all of those who participated in the food vision beef and sheep group as well as the stakeholders and representatives who participated in the food vision dairy group. As the Deputy will be aware, we have a 25% reduction in emissions to achieve by the end of 2030 from the agriculture sector as part of our overall contribution to achieving 51% economy-wide by 2030. The Deputy's party did not have a position on what the figures should be. I have worked hard to ensure the ultimate outcome in terms of the sectoral target for agriculture was kept manageable. It will stretch us at 25% but it is doable. I want to be informed by the sectors and farmer representatives in particular as to how we step this forward because working together is going to be key in delivery. Building on the massive work that family farmers done on the environment, improvements in emissions,and further efficiencies will be important but we have to step it out in a way that gets us to that 25% reduction by 2030. I have received the two reports. I received the food vision dairy group report approximately three weeks ago and I received the food vision beef and sheep group report last week. I am reflecting on and considering it. It is a submission to me and not all the measures in it have the support of everyone, in particular the issue relating to the suckler herd. Whether there will be a voluntary scheme is something that does not have support from any of the farm organisations or, indeed, from the meat factories or processors. I will reflect on all of that and on the suite of options.That is only one of the aspects but is the one that has received most attention. Both those reports contain many options that can make a difference in achieving our emissions reduction. The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to the suckler sector, which is the anchor of our beef industry and needs to remain so. I have a massive commitment to it which is why I have put in the new beef suckler scheme under the new CAP. I am not making a judgment one way or another on both reports until they are fully considered and then I will make my position clear.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	104	We would have a much better agricultural policy and overall discussion if the Minister was willing to engage on issues. Through our suckler herd we produce some of the most sustainable beef in the world. The associated carbon emissions are half of that coming from South American beef. For the Government to even contemplate a forced reduction of Irish suckler cattle while the Mercosur trade agreement remains on the table would send a bad message to rural communities and would undermine climate action measures. Such a move would be rightly seen as hypocritical and counterproductive. The suckler image is the brand of Ireland. It is what has given all sectors the reputation across the world as having a premium product. However, it is only sector to see a scheme introduced aimed at reduction through the ill-fated beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme. I accept that suckler farmers like those in every other sector must utilise every option to reduce emissions, including opportunities for diversification, but why has the Minister not ruled out such a move when he is on record as saying that 25% sectoral reductions can be achieved while "stabilising the herd", to use his language?
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	105	I have received the two reports and at this point I am not cherry-picking different options or proposals within either of them in advance of making a final decision on all of them. That is all I am saying. My commitment to the suckler herd is clear and that is why I have increased the payments next year under the beef suckler scheme from what had been €90 on the first ten cows under the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, to €150 from January, which is important for the sector. The suckler sector must remain the anchor of our beef sector. It is massively important and will continue to be fully supported by me. Alongside meeting our emissions targets, we will provide new opportunities for all farmers in terms of energy, for example through anaerobic digestion and solar power. They provide important income streams for farmers. I hope all farmers consider that alongside the important work they are doing at the moment. I have made no decision and I will not cherry-pick one issue over the other. Those are not my proposals; they are two proposals from the food vision report on which different stakeholders have taken different views. I will fully consider them and then make my views clear.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	106	As the Minister said, we have 80,000 suckler farms. They are a crucial economic driver in many rural communities. They are not the most profitable but they are often the most economically impactful. Before considering any suckler reduction scheme, will the Minister commit to considering the potential impact that such a scheme would have on the land mobility service by driving up the price of remaining agricultural land and what that could do for generational renewal? Will he ensure a full audit of factory-controlled feedlots and strive for a reduction within that cohort, which has experienced a 52% increase since 2017 and could hit 400,000 this year before targeting small suckler farms? Crucially, will he commit to carry out a full socioeconomic impact assessment before any scheme is introduced?
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	107	There are no plans at the moment to introduce such a scheme. We have two reports: the food vision dairy group report, which has proposed a voluntary reduction scheme for dairy farmers that had significant support among a number of stakeholders on the group. Some of the farm organisations reserved their position on that. We have another proposal from the beef and sheep group on which there are various views. Most of the farm organisations and the meat processors have not been in favour of any voluntary reduction in the suckler sector. I am considering both reports. I have backed suckler beef farming and will continue to do so. That is why I put in place a new scheme from January next year that will pay €150 per cow for the first ten. It will improve the efficiency of the herd as well as reducing emissions and costs through improved genetics. I, as Minister, and we, as a Government, will continue to ensure that farm incomes are central for beef suckler farmers while in the process, try to reduce our emissions. I am considering both reports in the context of what we can do for our overall climate action plan targets. I will work closely with the sector to ensure incomes and the impact of any proposal is fully considered. Ultimately in anything we do, we need to see farm incomes increase in the process.

The purpose of the scheme is to incentivise farmers to have enough fodder for the coming winter. Would it not be prudent to take measures to maximise participation by not restricting it to those in the scheme last year? Why was the scheme devised in a manner that excludes so many farmers?
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	109	Yes, I will open up to new entrants next year because I want to ensure everyone who makes fodder or hay next year has the additional costs involved in that supported by the Government. As the Deputy will be aware, I launched the 2023 fodder support scheme on 2 November. The 2022 scheme proved to be successful with more than 71,000 applicants, with each of them due to receive an average payment of €735 - the maximum payment was €1,000. These payments began issuing to farmers over the past week. The 2023 fodder support scheme is a continuance of the 2022 scheme and aims to incentivise farmers, in particular dry stock farmers, to grow more fodder - silage and hay - next year to ensure we do not have any animal welfare issues during the winter of 2023 and spring of 2024. We are planning well ahead to ensure we head off any issues while supporting family farms in the process. The scheme is a reflection of the significant increase in input costs such as fertiliser, energy and silage wrapping. That is why I moved to put the scheme in place this year. It has been successful; I have outlined the number of applicants. Thankfully, it has been successful in ensuring good supplies of fodder in the country this year. Farmers have stepped up to the mark to ensure they have been productive and that we have good stores. We do not know what next April and May might bring. The ground might be frozen hard as happened ten years ago leading to a fodder crisis. If that happens, I want to ensure there is enough silage and hay in the sheds. That sits alongside the tillage incentive scheme we introduced this year, which resulted an increase of 6% or 7% in our overall grain supply. I wanted the money out by the end of this year for farmers to help as many of them as possible next year to buy fertiliser ahead to ensure they have it to grow grass and to be productive next year. To administer it effectively, as a starting point I made it open to all those already in system and all those who applied this year so they could have a handy process of reapplying for 2023 For those who did not apply this year, it will open up for new applicants in the spring. I wanted to ensure we could drive on as quickly as possible now and that is why we have done it for the existing applicants ahead of time.
#MartinBrowne	unknown-#MartinBrowne-party	unknown-#MartinBrowne-dob	unknown-#MartinBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	110	The Minister has made it clear that it will be open for people who did not qualify last year. For example, someone who took over a farm would not have submitted the application in time. They may apply in the spring. I agree with him that the majority of farmers plan ahead and ensure they have enough fodder for their animals. Did he say that payments went out this week and the new applicants need to wait until spring? Can that not be brought forward? Is it possible that those who lost out last year might be able to get payments from the start of the year, rather than in spring? At what stage in early or late spring will they be paid?
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	111	There will be a great deal more work involved if we open up the scheme to new applicants to be paid by the end of the year because there was a great deal of work involved in getting the scheme up and running for the 77,000 applicants who applied for it. The details are all on the system. We opened up the system again and we take it they are applying for next year. It is very straightforward and needed to be so to have it done quickly. Bringing in totally new applications would slow down the system and make it more difficult to administer for all of those whose applications are already in. I expect a very small number of new entrants or applications next year. Those making fodder next year would all have been making it this year as well.  There will be new entrants to the scheme and there will be some who, for different reasons, did not apply and I want to accommodate them. I said on budget day that the scheme would be open to them in the spring and they can plan on the basis that they will be able to apply. We will process the applications in the springtime, and certainly in advance of the fodder-making season because they need the help in the same way as everybody else needed it this year.
#MartinBrowne	unknown-#MartinBrowne-party	unknown-#MartinBrowne-dob	unknown-#MartinBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	112	There is just one other category on which I would like to get the Minister's thoughts, namely, dairy farmers and hill farmers who would have lands classified as category 1 under the areas of natural constraint. They also fall outside the new peer group. This group is also not immune to the increases in fodder, feeding costs, etc. They are also food producers who are trying to make a living. The Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, estimate that a very significant number of dry stock farmers could find themselves ineligible. Will this group be eligible for the scheme or do those whose lands are classified as category 1 stay outside the scheme?
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	113	I will deal first with the dairy farmers and then I will deal with the dry stock or livestock farmers who do not make hay or silage themselves. With regard to dairy farmers, my core objective for the scheme was to ensure that, as a country, we produced enough fodder to ensure we are fodder and food secure this autumn, winter and spring, and that every farmer would be supported in the making of hay or silage.  The evidence from Teagasc is that, thankfully, dairy has had one of its best years ever for incomes, where milk is at a record price. The feedback on activity on dairy farms is that there was no issue in respect of making fodder. Activity levels were as good as ever and the increased income for farmers was out-stripping the increased costs of inputs. That is good to see. The situation was different in beef and sheep and I brought in the scheme to support them with their additional costs to ensure there would not be a reduction in fodder making. That benefits everyone right across the system because if we have enough fodder in the country; every sector benefits, including the dairy sector. This keeps the price of fodder manageable.  On that very point, very briefly, those who do not make fodder themselves benefit from that being the case. If we can keep fodder prices manageable by having a good supply in the country, those who do not normally make fodder have access to it, and not at extreme prices because of supply and demand challenges.  Everyone benefits if we have enough fodder and I have directed the funding where it was most needed to ensure fodder is made.

I am sure the Minister is well aware of this issue and I will expand on it in the further minutes I have, but this was the issue that was raised at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the past week. It was not a new issue at that point; it has been going on for several years for Dan Brennan and his family. Dan himself gave evidence before the committee and I am asking for a public inquiry and to ensure all of the stakeholders who are relevant to this matter are included in such an inquiry.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	115	I thank Deputy Funchion for her question. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was involved with other public sector bodies in an investigation of animal health and environmental concerns on the farm of the person to whom the Deputy has referred and has provided details. I am aware of the case of the person the Deputy has referred to and I understand the burden the situation has placed on him. This inter-agency group, IAG, was convened in June 2004 and comprised my Department’s laboratories, the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as Teagasc, the HSE and Kilkenny County Council. Two separate investigations and a review were undertaken. The first of the investigations was led by my Department's veterinary laboratory service, VLS. Extensive field and laboratory investigations were undertaken on the farm. Laboratory results were provided to the herdowner on an ongoing basis and supports for a comprehensive herd health programme were also provided.  On the conclusion of the VLS investigations and as part of the IAG, the VLS reported its findings in June 2006. This report was provided to the herdowner and his advisers at that time. Subsequently, and on foot of a request by the herdowner and his advisers, University College Dublin’s Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, CVERA, was commissioned to conduct further epidemiological studies of problems on the farm. That report was completed in August 2009.  This was provided to the herdowner and his advisers.  The inter-agency group reviewed the findings of both investigations and published its final report in August 2010. This was also provided to the herdowner and his advisers. Both investigation reports and the report of the inter-agency group review referred to above detail all of the comprehensive studies of animal health and environmental health parameters undertaken on this farm and the interpretation of those findings by experts from the agencies involved. These reports have been in the public domain since the conclusion of the investigative process and remain available for review by anyone who wishes to access them.

For anyone who is unaware of this case or situation, or is watching these proceedings, when I first heard about it, it reminded me of the movie "Erin Brockovich" or the movie that was based on the company which made Teflon. This man, who was an excellent farmer, was told time and time again by the State, which includes the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that he was basically not up to standard as a farmer. He had been saying all along that it was to do with a premises and industry which was in operation right next to his farm in respect of the contamination of his land. It turns out he was correct about that because when the company closed up, everything went back to exactly as it should be on the farm. He was, therefore, correct and was made to feel I am sure, at times, that he was going crazy. He was ridiculed and was totally and utterly let down. That is an understatement. There needs to be an inquiry now with all stakeholders because there needs to be accountability. It is not good enough for people to say they are sorry to Dan Brennan and his family, that they understand there was a burden, and that they understand how difficult it was.  We need accountability. People were telling him for years he was wrong but in fact he was correct. What is going to happen now, what compensation or what is going to come of this?

The reason I outlined the background to the case and the various assessments and investigations which took place was to outline that this is something that has been looked at in great detail. The investigations through the inter-agency group were completed as far back as 2010. This has been an issue and has been under consideration for a long time now, a very significant investigation and assessment has been carried out, and had been reported to the farmer and his advisers. That is the backdrop to this matter and that is why I outlined it. All of those reports are available for public assessment and viewing. There is not any proposal to reopen this matter and I believe there was a very thorough assessment and investigation at the time.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	118	That reply will not be acceptable to Dan Brennan and to the other farmers in the area. They attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine last week and there was great support for Dan. He was present with his wife and family, together with other farmers from the locality, and local IFA representatives. Although I am not a member of the agriculture committee, I attended it last week and this committee was very much of one voice on this issue. This is a cross-party committee which includes Government as well as Opposition representatives and the sense I got from the committee is that there is an appetite for a public inquiry into this. We cannot allow a situation to prevail where there is no accountability. This happens so often in this State and the one point I made at the committee last week was that any investigation which takes place needs to have very good, strong, robust and strict terms of reference which will allow for accountability. To say this man has been failed, while trying think of the correct language one can use in this Parliament, is an understatement. A great deal more needs to be done; this will not be the end of the matter. I am shocked to hear that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine believes that is just it. That certainly will not be the case from the point of view of the people in the area.

I welcome the fact that the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine considered the issue recently and, following that, l am interested in hearing the views and perspective of the committee on the hearing it had. I look forward to receiving that information and considering the matter. I outlined today the very comprehensive and in-depth reports and assessment, which were completed more than 12 years ago. The agriculture committee always keeps me up to speed with the work it undertakes, and I will certainly review any submission I receive from it.

We are supportive of that. I understand the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, has reached out to stakeholders. Will she outline if she intends to follow through with this on an all-island basis? Will she also outline the timeframe she is setting for that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	121	I thank the Deputy for his continued interest in this matter. As he will be aware, the wool feasibility study report was published in July of this year. The review, which was compiled independently by The Agile Executive, contains a number of findings and recommendations, including potential funding streams, market opportunities for wool and multiple areas for additional research and development. One of the main recommendations of the review was the establishment of an independent wool council by the industry, and this received widespread support. It is intended that this council will lead the development and promotion of Irish wool domestically and internationally. It will also act as a forum to bring together multiple stakeholders in order to foster collaboration, innovation and scaling activities in the wool sector. It is envisaged that the council will be a forum where stakeholders can further examine and explore the potential uses for wool identified in the wool feasibility study. Once established, my Department has committed to providing €30,000 in financial assistance towards the initial set-up costs. I have informed the relevant stakeholders that I am eager to see the formation of this stakeholder-led wool council as soon as possible. It is my understanding that a meeting of the relevant stakeholders is scheduled to take place next week. I welcome that. It is my hope that the wool council, once formed, will use the findings of the wool feasibility study report as a roadmap to develop pathways towards maximising the true potential of Irish wool into the future and to help drive increased returns for this great and sustainable product.

I suggest that the timeframes to date have been anything but satisfactory. A review of wool-based products was promised when the programme for Government was being put together, but it took until July 2021 for a tender to be put out in the first place. It was not until December 2021 that it was confirmed that a tender had been awarded and the report was published seven months later. Why has it taken nearly half the Government's term to commission and receive the report? Has the Minister of State begun any work on the short-term recommendations contained in the report? How does she propose to address the medium and long-term recommendations? Has she set targets for the short, medium and long-term ambitions she feels can be realised?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	123	I assure the Deputy that we have delivered on the programme for Government commitment. He will recall that we were in the midst of a Covid crisis for some time in the early part of the Government's term. We have come out of that well. I thank The Agile Executive, which went to great lengths to engage with stakeholders and put together this significant report, which contains a wealth of information on the wool sector and the potential direction to take. That is why we need the wool council to be formed as soon as possible. I am pleased to hear that the stakeholders are due to meet next week. Ultimately, it will be for them to decide the direction they take and to set short, medium and long-term objectives for the group.

I note that in the Seanad the Minister of State spoke about stakeholder engagement, but there seems to be a lack of clarity on the all-island aspect of that. The Sinn Féin spokesperson for agriculture in the North raised the matter and was told that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DEFRA, is considering the review and plans to engage with the Department here. What level of engagement has the Minister of State had with DEFRA and what stage are the discussions at? I ask this because if the recommendations contained within the report are to achieve the objectives, then we must ensure that all of the stakeholders are involved. I appreciate that the Minister of State says a meeting is due to take place next week with those involved in the all-island process who are ready and willing to get it under way but I seek clarity on what has been done and the proposed timeframe in which she proposes to achieve the spirit of the study itself.

What I would like to know is what concrete actions are happening, in particular in terms of interdepartmental efforts to investigate and move forward. One option is to develop wool as an insulation product. Insulating homes is a major priority of the Government, as it should be, although it might not be moving as quickly as I would like. No doubt the Minister of State will use Covid as the excuse, as it is used for every delay by the Government. It does seem that wool has some possibilities to be used for insulation. Currently, wool is practically being thrown out or farmers are getting very little for it. The cost of insulation is rising exponentially. It is one of the issues that is making it most difficult for the Government to meet its targets. What is being done in particular in that regard? Is there any engagement with industry? With the greatest of respect, €30,000 is not going to cut it if we are trying to develop a new product with such a significant capability to impact the industry.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	126	To clarify, the €30,000 is to help the establishment of the wool council. Once the council has been established, it is up to it, as the industry stakeholders, to come together with the ideas. Who knows what lies ahead? I urge the stakeholders to do that very swiftly. I would welcome any all-island approach and support the council may well achieve and engagement with farmers and stakeholders in Northern Ireland also. I acknowledge the potential benefits and uses of wool, of which there are many. Insulation is one aspect. We are engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on decarbonising housing, full stop. Timber has a significant role to play in that regard. If wool is an element too, that would be very exciting. However, we must achieve certain changes to aspects of building regulations in terms of fire safety and so forth. We are engaging on all sorts of aspects of housing.

I want to ask about the very important issue of farm safety. Perhaps the Minister would update the House on the Department's efforts in that regard to date in 2022.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	132	I thank Deputy Griffin for raising this important matter. He is aware that it is an area on which the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Heydon, has done significant work since his appointment two years ago. Farm safety is a major issue and farming continues to be the most dangerous occupation in terms of fatalities in the workplace. Fatal incidents on farms account for just over two in five of all workplace fatal incidents. Unfortunately, this year to date, there have been 12 fatalities on farms.Data from the Teagasc national farm survey, NFS, also reveal that there are approximately 4,500 non-fatal incidents each year on farms - this is a large number - and some of them result in life-changing injuries. The Government has prioritised farm safety, health and well-being. This is reflected in the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and the fact that the Government has assigned him specific responsibility for farm safety as part of his ministerial portfolio. He has done excellent work in this space and is playing a key role in driving a step change in our approach to farm safety. The Department implemented a series of farm safety, health and well-being initiatives over the course of this year, utilising dedicated funding of €2.25 million. These initiatives include capital support to make farms safer, support for education and awareness by promoting farm safety practices and risk awareness to encourage behavioural change around farm safety from a young age, and support for those who have been impacted by fatal and non-fatal incidents. The measures include the investment of €1.5 million in agricultural machinery and equine simulators for use in agricultural colleges; the Agri Aware farm safe schools initiative, in which 450 primary schools and 19,500 pupils participated this year; the acceleration of wear and tear allowances for farm safety equipment; farm safety training; and joint promotional farm safety campaigns with the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.

I commend the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, who has responsibility for this area, on their efforts to date. It is fitting that special responsibility be assigned to a Minister of State. Unfortunately, the 12 fatalities this year are 12 people who will not be at the Christmas dinner table with their families in a few weeks' time. My condolences go out to the families affected. The statistic that two in five workplace fatalities occur on farms is concerning. That message should never be lost. I tabled this question to try to keep the matter on the agenda. It is crucial. Complacency is probably the greatest enemy of them all. No one at any level, be it in the Department or on the front line on farms, should be complacent about farm safety. I ask that the Department continue its efforts.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	134	We will keep working on this. Under the suite of TAMS measures, grant aid has been provided for a wide range of farm safety-related investments, with health and safety guidelines included in all building specifications. This is an important step in supported on-farm investments. With the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, I will be increasing the rate of grant aid for farm safety-related investments to 60% under the capital investment scheme in 2023, subject to European Commission approval. Dedicated funding has been increased to €2.5 million in next year's budget, which will allow existing initiatives to continue and new ones to be developed to build on our efforts to improve farm safety, health and well-being. We can and are doing more on this front. The number of deaths and injuries on farms is too high and we need to continue taking steps to ensure that incident levels are reduced. Farming is the greatest and most rewarding profession in the country, so we must do everything we can to ensure that the farm is a safe place to work.
#MartinBrowne	unknown-#MartinBrowne-party	unknown-#MartinBrowne-dob	unknown-#MartinBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	135	We have dealt with this matter time and again at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Minister of State cannot deny at this stage that the Department's performance in forestry licensing is putting many prospective foresters off planting. While we may have problems now, we are facing into major ones down the road because of this. We have an annual target of 8,000 ha, yet afforestation stands at only 2,200 ha this week. This is coupled with the snail's pace of the reconstitution and underplanting scheme, RUS. The Minister of State needs to recognise that she and the Department are failing.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	136	I thank the Deputy for this question. Contrary to his understanding, I am pleased to advise that, due to the continued high output in forestry licensing this year, we have seen considerable reductions in the backlog of forestry licences and a year-on-year increase in the number of licences issued. We have invested significantly and strategically in easing the licensing backlog. We are issuing more licences than applications received, which is leading to faster turnaround times for new applicants. At the start of the year, we published a forestry licensing plan for 2022 that contained a target of 5,250 licences, an increase of 30% on 2021. By 2 December 2022, we had issued nearly 4,500 licences, which was 92% of our expected output by this point in the year. There are more than 1,000 approved afforestation licences, with just under 7,500 ha ready for planting. These improved outputs have been achieved through a commitment to continuous improvement as well as through a significant investment in resources. The positive impact of these measures can be seen in the increased number of licences issuing. This increase in licence output will remove one of the perceived barriers to planting. I am acutely aware of the afforestation target of 8,000 ha per year set out in the Climate Action Plan and the fact that afforestation rates have been declining in recent years. As the Deputy may know, the current forestry programme provides supports for afforestation, including grants and premiums, and covers the cost of establishing a forest. Despite strong support for landowners over a period of 15 years, we have not achieved the level of planting anticipated. We hope that the new forestry programme will re-engage landowners, particularly farmers, and realise the necessary change in land use. This will be the best-funded forestry programme in the history of the State, with €1.3 billion committed to its implementation. It is a significant vote of confidence in forestry as a public good and in farmers in particular.

The Government can congratulate itself all it likes, but its targets are not being met. Only 4,728 ha have been licensed this year. That is not an achievement, but a missed target. This topic has taken up most of the time of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine since I have been a member of it. Time and again, we have been told that the system is not working. What is holding the Department back? Why are private licences faring the worst? This is being noticed and commented on by foresters, a growing number of whom are no longer choosing to plant. There is a problem in our forestry sector now, but this Government will be responsible for a greater problem 20 or 25 years down the road when no one will be planting. There is frustration in the sector no matter where one turns. Under the RUS, foresters have waited more than two years just to get letters from the Department seeking more information. The Minister of State mentioned that the situation was going well. The Mackinnon report spawned other reports, but even it is not being adhered to.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	138	I can only reassure the Deputy. The weekly figures on how many forestry licences are being issued, the areas involved, the road lengths in question and so forth can be accessed through our Department's website. There has been a significant turnaround in the two and a half years since this Government took office. The House will be aware that we ground to a halt because of European court judgments against Ireland. We were not doing what we should have been doing, resulting in our Department having to transform how it issued licences. We have done that well and we have made year-on-year improvements since then. With a new forestry programme in place from next year, a new forest strategy and more money than ever to incentivise and support farmers in planting trees, we are going to see a step change in the number of trees planted and farmer engagement with forestry.

Lengthy delays in processing applications are resulting in many choosing not to plant. They foresee the same delays happening down the road as affected felling licences. There is another area of discontent. Coillte's felling licences are above target. If we are to see a resolution to the crisis and to avert it dissuading potential new entrants, a new statutory period within which a decision is provided to applicants needs to be established. The Mackinnon report needs to be implemented in a fashion similar to Scotland. We need movement on reports, not more reports on reports that end up sitting on shelves. Targets are being missed today, the impact of which will be felt years down the road.I hope this is the last conversation we have on missing targets.

The question is whether the Department is meeting its targets. The last time I was in this Chamber with Deputy Fitzmaurice the Minister of State accused him of being very negative. People cannot be legitimately accused of being negative for pointing out the obvious. I very much welcome the new forestry programme and the additional funding. With inflation running at 10%, the failure to index-link it is a problem. For the ten years that inflation was low, it was not a problem but the position is different when inflation is as it has been for the last 12 months. The Minister of State will know better than I do, from sitting at Cabinet, what the predictions are for inflation for the next decade. A sizeable number of economists believe we have entered into a new cycle of interest rates and inflation will remain very high. That will eat into the additional money provided.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	141	I acknowledge that confidence is low in the sector and we need to work towards regaining that confidence. I would like to think that the new forestry programme will help with that in a significant way. Unfortunately, I can do nothing about the base, which was there before I started. We can only move in one direction, as I believe we are doing, and that is improving and delivering licences like never before, or certainly not in recent years. We are at 92% of expected output, which is a good place to be. Coillte tends to get more licences because it supplies 60% or 70% of timber to the sawmill sector. That comparison is continually made but it is about the supply chain and ensuring there is an adequate supply of timber into the saw mill sector. That had ground to a halt when I took office. There are improvements across the board in forestry.

This is a period of exceptional challenge and uncertainty for our farm families and I have been working to support them through this period. The rise in feed and fertiliser prices in the last year has been significant. There are a number of factors at play in the market, including energy prices which remain well above January 2021 levels, and increased global demand, particularly from the big grain-producing countries. Controls of fertiliser exports from large fertiliser-producing countries, increased transport costs and EU-imposed tariffs and duties on certain third country imports are all impacting on prices for feed and fertiliser for farmers. Higher production costs have been an unwelcome feature across all sectors in 2022, with price rises for all the main farm inputs.  To support farmers with appropriate advice, earlier this year, I set up a national fodder and feed security committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Mike Magan, working very closely with Teagasc and its director, Dr. Frank O'Mara, and all the key farm leaders to bring all stakeholders together and ensure appropriate guidance to farmers. Teagasc have also been active in providing advice to farmers. Over the past year, I have announced a series of targeted interventions for farmers, including support to increase the production of native grain from the tillage sector, as well as a multi-species sward and red clover sward initiative, which thrive with little or no fertiliser application and which, combined, had a total budget allocation of over €12 million to support farmers. In addition, I launched a €56 million fodder support scheme in June to which over 70,000 farmers have applied and which generated payments in the order of €54 million last week. In addition, an advance payment under the 2023 scheme of the order of €30 million will issue before Christmas. I, along with my officials, will continue to actively engage with the animal feed and fertiliser industries, as well as farmers on this issue over the next period. I will also raise concerns with my European counterparts and the European Commission to ensure there continues to be an adequate supply of fertilisers available.

My Department, working closely with Teagasc, is assessing the impact of costs on farm incomes. That is why I stepped forward with the fodder support this year to which farmers have responded very strongly. It is also why I brought forward the payment for next year to enable farmers to plan ahead and equip them with additional funds to purchase fertiliser ahead for next year. I also introduced the tillage incentive scheme of €400 per hectare to try to improve the production of feed domestically. That is an important scheme which I want to develop in the time ahead. Another significant change we made in the recent budget was to recognise the impact of energy costs at farm level by ensuring farm families were eligible for the energy support scheme. That was an important ask from stakeholders and we delivered it. Planning ahead and making ourselves more resilient are important. I have spoken about the multi-species sward and the liming grant for next year. We are also making a significant step change around solar investments by providing up to 60% grant aid for investment of up to €90,000 of solar investment for each farm.

That has not happened at EU level. It is a small proportion of the very high cost of fertiliser at the moment but it would have been a help nonetheless. I am disappointed that did not progress at EU level. I know Kildare, where Deputy Durkan comes from, has a great tillage sector and it is one we want to continue to support. On the pressures in the year ahead and risks around cost, I foresee that the risks will be similar to what they were this year. We do not know how matters will evolve. We do not know if the pressures will be the same but it is a volatile time and we have to be prepared and try to support farm families through the next year. That is why we have made a forward payment on the fodder scheme and will run the tillage scheme again next year. It provides a €400 payment for each extra hectare grown next year, as well as a €200 maintenance payment for each extra hectare grown this year. The multi-species sward grant will be in place next year and, for the first time ever, there will be a liming grant to support farmers to reduce their costs, become more productive and reduce emissions. We have this suite of measures in place and the energy support scheme is also available to farmers to insulate them from the pressures in the year ahead.

He will warmly welcome how the Government is delivering on this and many other issues. Solar has considerable potential. We want to back farm families in developing it, availing of it and benefiting from it. To encourage on-farm renewable technology uptake and usage, grant aid is provided through grants made available by my Department under the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS. Grants are currently available for solar photovoltaic, PV, technology and solar PV rechargeable batteries, and also solar panels, or solar thermal, for water heating under the pig and poultry capital investment scheme. An on-farm solar PV survey must be completed and submitted to avail of a grant. I was delighted recently to announce, as part of the budget, that the electricity consumption of a dwelling house can now be included, with immediate effect, on the solar survey as part of the holding for sizing the solar PV installation. The dwelling house must be occupied by the herd owner or family member and situated on the holding. The scheme is now open for applications. The maximum panel size eligible for grant aid under the pig and poultry scheme is 62 kW, and it is 11 kW under other eligible TAMS II schemes. To encourage further uptake, I am proposing further changes to the scheme. I will be increasing the number of kilowatts for solar applications under TAMS III to 30 kW from 11 kW. This is a very significant increase that will bring in more energy-intensive farms and cover their electricity usage through on-farm generation.

I would imagine that the Minister has been at more IFA meetings than I have, but at several of them I have seen a large number of people who are ready for change. Some of the complaints, particularly those over recent years, relate to the fact that people did not believe the solar panel grant scheme was where it should have been and that it was not fit for purpose. I am hopeful about the changes the Minister is proposing. I am aware that there have been difficulties in that we have not got anaerobic digestion to the point where we need it. We need to get all the pieces together. Could the Minister give me a general notion of the timeline for the changes? Could he give us information on the number of farmers availing of the grants? Can anything be done to ensure we get the best bang for our buck for both the farmers and wider society?

A significant thing I am doing to drive uptake among farm families is providing a separate €90,000 allocation under TAMS specifically for solar. It is separate from the €90,000 allocation for other on-farm investments. There has been a bit of a drag regarding the uptake of solar under the last TAMS because the money all came out of the one investment and people had to choose between solar and something else. I do not want people not doing solar because they choose something else; I want everyone to do it. With 60% in grant aid to cover solar panels, plus batteries, which are really important, and given that the funding is entirely separate from that associated with other TAMS investments, every farm family needs to consider solar. It makes financial sense. We want to drive it on. The two Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Heydon, and I want to see farmers availing of this opportunity. They will save money and make themselves more profitable through it. It will also make a genuine difference in respect of emissions reductions. I foresee a big step change.

I welcome the separate allocation for batteries and solar panels, because we want people to opt for every means of electricity generation given the circumstances we find ourselves in. Could the Minister indicate the sorts of numbers we are looking at? Uptake is vital because we really need to ensure we are operating at scale and we address any faults in the grant scheme as the changes are being made. Could the Minister outline the general position on microgeneration and anaerobic digestion? I realise these are partly beyond his direct remit.

I want everybody to do so. With regard to microgeneration, I am engaging with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on his plans to develop a feed-in tariff, separate from TAMS, that farmers will be able to use to generate more solar energy – for example, by having solar panels in fields. This would allow them to feed into the grid, be paid and make money on a purely commercial basis. On anaerobic digestion, we have a lot of work to do to realise our potential. We have seen great progress. Ireland is now one of the leading countries in Europe in wind energy generation. There has been a major focus on that over the past decade. There is also a considerable focus now on solar. We will also focus significantly on anaerobic digestion. Our plan is that, by 2030, 10% of our total national gas consumed in houses and businesses will come from farms through anaerobic digestion. This will require a big step change and significant investment. It will also require a renewable heat obligation tariff to drive the investment.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	158	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Forestry is the largest tool in our armour to achieve climate action and sequestration. We know it is essential. Our new forest strategy is all about planting the right trees in the right places, under the right management and for the right purpose. This applies across the board, regardless of whether the planting is for timber, the local economy, amenity value, biodiversity or water quality. With that in mind, we have come up with an innovative forestry programme to encourage farmers. Ultimately, we will be largely reliant on our farmers to plant the trees of the future. We have adjusted old programmes, put in place new measures and are considering more supports for practices such as agroforestry, which allows farmers to grow crops or have animals graze between planted trees. This will be a really attractive option for farmers here. The practice is fairly widespread in other countries but not so much here. We have changed legislation to allow farmers to plant up to a hectare of native woodland on their farms without the need for a licence. Again, this is another mechanism by which we recognise the importance of tree-planting and some of the difficulties around licensing. It is an acknowledgment of the need that we absolutely have to increase our afforestation targets. We have been off target, as we all acknowledge and have known for several years, and it is really time to turn that around. I really hope the new forestry programme will help in that matter.

There is quite a difference between some of the hardwood trees and some of the conifers. The much-maligned Sitka spruce has been consigned to the waste bin in most cases, wrongly in my opinion. It has a huge contribution to make, particularly in shelter. In forests, the outer ring should normally be of a sheltering variety that ensures the species on the inside enjoy the right growing conditions. It would be helpful if the Minister of State were more specific in advertising what is best in these kinds of environments so the farming community can consider tree-growing on ordinary farmland and headlands, and also in corners that are sometimes not suited to farming.Such land could be used for tree-growing.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	160	I take on board what the Deputy has said. We anticipate that foresters, with whom farmers must engage in order to avail of any of our programmes, would have a role as part of that. I would like to think that foresters would impart that advice to farmers. Certainly, I appreciate the balance we need. Last week, Green Party Senators proposed a motion in the Seanad on the use of wood in construction. It emphasised the need to ramp this up if we are to try to decarbonise our construction sector. There are many wonderful examples from across Europe and the UK of aspects of this activity we do not engage with here. We will need soft woods, such as our fast-growing conifers, for these purposes. It would be nice to think that in years to come, instead of exporting maybe 70% of our timber products, we will use more of them here. I am absolutely cognisant of the need for soft wood and conifers.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	161	I will make another suggestion. I am seeking to ascertain the degree to which this can be expanded. Certain tree varieties, such as apple trees and pear trees, can be used for three purposes: for decorative purposes at certain times of the year, for food purposes, and for wood purposes when their lifespan has dissipated. Has any evaluation been done of the utilisation of wasteland, headlands, corners of fields or otherwise inoperable situations from an agriculture point of view? How can such lands can be utilised beneficially?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	162	I do not have the figures on that, but it is a good point. We are in the process of a land use review. Maybe part of that might identify some of these inaccessible corners. There are plenty of them. There is a good example from County Clare, where such an area is called the hare's corner. They have engaged with farmers. It can be about putting in a pond or planting trees in more inaccessible areas. This brings biodiversity onto the farm without taking much from productivity. On the question of fruit trees, orchards are not classified as forestry and neither are Christmas trees. Those plantations do not get categorised like that. In our new agroforestry proposals, which are classified as forestry, farmers can plant up to 15% of fruit or nut trees. That is an exciting proposition. We can review it if we get a good uptake and if we get feedback from farmers on it. I think it is a step in the right direction.

#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	164	The Deputy will be as well aware as I am that we have had a massive cultural challenge over the years around women not being treated equally with men when it comes to farm inheritance because of cultural perceptions. It has been the case for too long that a son or nephew is often preferred over a niece or daughter regardless of interest levels. This has led to a situation where only 13% of our farm holders are women, even though the latest census figures show that 70,000 women in the country are involved in farm management and in actual active farming. I want to address this. Obviously, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett. wants to address it. The Government very much wants to address it. To help to break down this cultural barrier, we have taken the unprecedented step of allocating 60% grant aid for female farmers as part of a CAP initiative. We want to encourage that. We want to get the message out there that it is not acceptable to have such a low level of female farm holders. We want to improve that and this measure can help to do that. It is not a silver bullet but it is a very clear message. In other areas of the agrifood sector such as the food business, and in the educational courses provided around the country through Teagasc, further education providers, institutes of technology and universities, the representation of women is fantastic alongside men. There is great participation. If one calls a vet to come to the yard for an animal in need, it is more likely that a female vet will arrive than a male vet because there are more female vets emerging from our colleges. It is not yet being seen at a farm level within the farm gate. We want to address that and change that to get the message out there that we want to see more female farmers. It is great to see and we will support it.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	165	Of course it is welcome that more female vets are coming out of the agricultural colleges, but the reality is that it is to do with the points system. When one looks at the very top achievers when it comes to third level entry points, one sees that they are often women rather than men. Just because a person has obtained an excellent number of points - regardless of being male or female - it does not mean that he or she will become an excellent vet or doctor. I do not want to digress. I am glad the Minister referred to messaging. This is about tokenism rather than any actual impact it would have. The idea that when a farmer is deciding who to leave his or her farm to, he or she will decide to leave it to his or her niece rather than his or her nephew because she would get a better TAMS grant is ridiculous. What is not ridiculous - it is very real - is that if a farmer has a son and a daughter who are interested in farming, and both of them inherit the farm and are over a certain age, one of them will get a far greater grant rate than the other if they apply under this scheme. Not alone is this a little ridiculous, but it may not be lawful. I presume the Equal Status Act applies to the activities of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as well.

This is why we are pushing the barriers out, getting the message out there strongly, and actually doing it in terms of supports. If there is anything else we can do, we will certainly look at that and be very open to it. I wish to update the Deputy on the appointment of a former Tánaiste and Minister for agriculture, Mary Coughlan, who was the first Minister for agriculture in the country, as chair of the dialogue on women in agriculture.

It is great to be serving alongside the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, as the first female Minister of State in this role at Cabinet level. We have appointed the former Minister, Mary Coughlan, to chair the dialogue on women in agriculture, which will take place on St. Brigid's Day, 1 February. This will bring together all stakeholders and farm representatives within the country to gather more ideas and proposals on how we can make a difference in this regard. I look forward to that. If the Deputy has any proposals or suggestions, our ears are fully open and we will look at driving them on.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	169	The first suggestion I have is that the Minister would end the discrimination, regardless of its motivation. I believe the times are gone when a farmer would leave his farm to his eldest son regardless of whether he wanted it, or indeed would leave it to a son over a daughter. Most farmers now are relieved if any of their children are interested in farming, or, if they have no child, any nieces or nephews are interested in farming. That can be a relief to them because it is a difficult life and it is not very profitable. Obviously, farming is hugely profitable in the dairy sector but that faces its own challenges. With the rest of farming, I suggest that commensurate to the hours that people work, there are far better incomes to be obtained elsewhere. Most farmers are very relieved if any of their children are interested in farming, or any successor is interested in farming. I think the days of primogeniture or leaving it to the eldest son are well and truly over. That is a good thing. Of course I welcome that the Department is bringing people together to discuss this, but maybe it is coming a little late. Farmers have moved on, frankly.

If the grant aid varies between male and female applicants, obviously there is a slight challenge there to the equality legislation. I hope this can be overcome.

That is the problem. There is not equality on the ground. Female farmers own 13% of the farms. There are cultural elements there and farms are not being left to girls, daughters and nieces, but it is difficult. There are amazing female farmers out there but it is difficult to be a female farmer. When one goes to the mart, it is 95% men.It can be a difficult place to go to. One can go to a knowledge transfer group. That can be challenging. I have spoken to women who have gone to knowledge transfer groups who do not go any more. One element of that is that we are putting together female-only knowledge transfer groups because that is what we have heard female farmers would like. For us not to respond to what we hear from female farmers would be us not standing up for them. We are trying to make this a more equal space, and those are some of the many mechanisms we are trying to put in place to do that.

The Government's housing disaster is now leading to a staff crisis for business and our public services, including schools and hospitals. Teachers and nurses are unable to afford housing near the schools in which they teach and the hospitals in which they work. A recent survey carried out by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, found that two out of three nursing graduates are considering emigrating, with one in three considering leaving our cities. We now have nurses spending half their salaries on extortionate rents, often in unsuitable accommodation, with many not able to find a place at all. We cannot open additional beds if we do not have the nurses to staff them. Our nurses should be able to look forward to a future in which they can build lives for themselves at home, but thousands of nurses do not have that opportunity. Many of them have written to Sinn Féin in recent weeks to share their heartbreaking experience of struggling to get by. Reading through what they have told us, one can see very clearly that they are exhausted, anxious and overwhelmed with stress, they struggle to find accommodation, they fork out extortionate sums on rent every month and they worry endlessly about their future. Sadly, many of them see no light at the end of the tunnel. They have written to us of their worries about being forced to emigrate just to have a decent quality of life. I will give the Tánaiste a couple of examples. A 21-year-old student nurse in her final year in Limerick told us in her own words:Last year I was homeless for the first semester of college as my accommodation fell through last minute. I wasted all my savings staying in hotels to attend my lectures and then had to sofa surf.I couldn’t afford much else during this time and didn’t have facilities to cook my own food in hotels. I lost so much weight due to this and the stress… I’m currently looking for different accommodation to move out before Christmas but it’s proving impossible to even get a response from landlords.As soon as I qualify I will be leaving the country, along with most of my classmates, as the stress is genuinely not worth staying. All I want is a secure place to live. Another nurse wrote to us. She is from County Louth. She wrote:I’m 33 and my husband is 34. We both live in the garage of my parents’ house. We will never be able to afford our own home.We’re emigrating next year for good. It’s a shame as Ireland is such a beautiful country, it’s our home. I could put dozens more heartbreaking letters like that on the public record. These people are qualified and trained. They want to look after patients and want to provide for our health service but they see no future as a result of the housing crisis the Tánaiste and his party have caused and sustained. These nurses have told us of their anxiety. Many of them have told us they do not see a future here. However, the Tánaiste has told these nurses in the past that he knows better. He has lectured them like he has other public sector workers and other young people who have decided to emigrate. He has told them that the grass is not always greener on the other side. However, no one really knows the reality these nurses are living or the difficulties they face better than themselves. The housing crisis is wearing them down. It is forcing them out of this country to seek a better future for themselves. The facts are blatantly obvious for anybody to see. When will the penny drop? When will the Government take action? This is no longer a housing crisis; this is a social crisis. This is creeping into every sphere of Irish society, from education to health to business. When will the Government introduce a three-year ban on rent increases, as we have been calling for for many years, to ensure that a month's rent is put back into renters' pockets through a refundable tax credit?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	177	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and for sharing some of the stories and experiences he has put on the record of the House. To be very clear once again, absolutely everyone on this side of the House, including everyone in government, accepts that we have a deep crisis when it comes to housing. We have seen a big increase in our population and we have an economy that is growing very fast. New households are being formed every day and we have not been able to build enough new homes and apartments to keep up with that increasing demand over the past ten years. We acknowledge that has led to a very deep social crisis that is affecting our country as well as a very deep personal crisis for many people. We see it manifest in lots of different ways, including very high rents that people have to pay and younger people - and not just younger people - struggling to buy their first home. We see it in homelessness now rising again. We also see it, as the Deputy outlined, in some of the difficulties the public sector, including the health service and the education system, and private companies are having in recruiting and retaining staff, particularly in Dublin and our cities, but not exclusively there. There has been some real progress, and it would be unfair not to acknowledge it. We anticipate that this year we will build approximately 28,000 new homes. That is more than any year in maybe ten years, and that does not include derelict homes being brought back into use or student accommodation. That is the kind of figure we expect we will achieve this year. It is not enough but it is more new homes than in any year in the past ten. In the past 12 months, 16,000 first-time buyers - they are not just statistics; they are people, couples, families - bought their own home. That is more than any year in the past 15. ONe would have to go back to 2005, 2006 or 2007 before seeing that many people buying their first home. That is progress but I acknowledge that it is not enough. It is nowhere near enough, and we need to do much better to turn the corner on housing in the months and years ahead. We are introducing the rent tax credit. That will be available for people to claim in the next couple of weeks, I believe. It is something the Deputy and his party advocated for a long time. We have agreed to do that. It is worth €1,000 per renter, provided he or she is paying income tax. For two people, a couple, renting a house, that is €2,000. In a lot of cases that will be a month's rent back into people's pockets. Three people renting a house or an apartment will get €3,000 between the three of them, and, therefore, in a lot of cases it will be a month's rent back into people's pockets - sometimes more, sometimes less. That is something we are doing and people will see that money in the period ahead. When it comes to nurses specifically, we have a pay agreement with the public service that will pay increases for nurses and other public servants over the next year. We have the rent tax credit I mentioned and the new form of cost-rental housing, whereby the Government provides rental housing at a below-market cost. That can make a big difference too. When it comes to a rent freeze, we have rent pressure zones, as the Deputy will be aware. The figures from daft.ie, for example, and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, show that for people who are established tenants and who have somewhere to rent already, rents went up by approximately 2.5% last year. The real problem is the new tenancies, that is, new properties coming to the market. A rent freeze would not affect them because they are being let for the first time. There are just not enough of them, and that is why the price of them is too high. The solution has to be mostly about supply, although not all about supply. We have to do everything possible to increase supply over the coming months and years and to stem the exodus of small landlords from the market, which is a big part of the problem as well.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	178	The Tánaiste talked about pay agreements and so on. Half the nurses in this State did not get the pay increase to which they were entitled that other public sector workers got in October. That is how we are treating nurses. The issue of rents and housing is at crisis point. The Tánaiste said the Government is not doing enough. I put it to him that so many people are emigrating because they see no hope his Government will change track.For 12 years, Fine Gael has been in government. For 12 years, individuals, be they nurses or teachers, have seen the housing crisis deteriorate. Homelessness figures have never been as high with 11,000 people homeless while rents and house prices have never been as high. We are seeing indicators of commencements dropping off significantly over the past number of months. For many years, we have been calling on the Government to introduce a rent freeze to make sure rents remain at their current level and put a month's rent back into renters' pockets. When we put this proposition to the Government first, the Tánaiste defended the income of landlords. He said that one person's rent is a landlord's income.  The point we are making is that this is not just a housing crisis; this is a crisis in health and education. The INMO has pointed out that 46% of graduates in a major hospital in Dublin are leaving. They are not staying. This is on the Government's watch. Can the Tánaiste give us some confidence that there will be a change of direction? Will it introduce a rent freeze for three years and will it stop these extortionate rents increasing year on year?

They have been paid to the vast majority of public servants but I acknowledge that has not been the case in large parts of our health service. I met with the unions during the week. I met the head of the INMO, Ms Phil Ni Sheaghdha, and the head of ICTU and they raised this issue. We agree that it is not acceptable that people who work in our health service did not get their pay increase at the same time as civil servants, teachers, gardaí and everyone else so we are working on that. The Deputy knows that payroll systems in the health service do not operate the way they should. It is our responsibility to fix that and we are working on that. We can guarantee people that they will get that payment, even if it is late. Regarding the Deputy's proposals, the rent tax credit will be a month's rent back in renters' pockets in many cases.

Last week, I raised some stories about the human face of the housing crisis. They were stories about people at the sharp end of the housing crisis such as the 27 renters who were renting premises within a stone's throw of where I live in the south city centre off Camden Street that was not suitable for residential accommodation. These people were renting patently unsuitable premises because they could not find and afford anywhere else. This week, we heard about a shortage of teachers, particularly in Dublin, and difficulties retaining and recruiting teachers, nurses and staff in every sector from hospitality to retail to the professions to multinationals. The difficulty arises because people cannot get appropriate accommodation in our capital city. We have got to a point where there is now a Dublin penalty - a penalty people pay where they are seeking to work and live in Dublin but cannot afford to do so. I am hearing increasingly desperate stories of people earning what would be considered good wages who cannot afford suitable or appropriate accommodation anywhere within an easy commute of jobs in the city centre so it has become a Dublin penalty. We see the shortage of accommodation throughout the country, particularly in urban areas.  Like many colleagues, when I cycle around my constituency, I still see properties lying empty and sites undeveloped. In recent weeks, we heard from Dublin City Council that 28,000 live planning permissions in its area have not been activated. Enabling or facilitating the lying empty of premises and the non-activation of live planning permissions is fuelling the record homelessness figures that are so shameful for us all. This is what is fuelling escalating rents, lengthening housing lists and substandard living standards for so many people. To misappropriate the phrase of the writer O. Henry, Dublin will be a great place if they ever finish it. What we are not seeing from Government is a policy that will encourage and incentivise the finishing of Dublin and ensure that people will have decent places to live in our city centre and will be able to live and work in Dublin city, in particular, but also in towns and cities around the country without paying exorbitant rents and mortgages. We know this situation has arisen because of years of reliance on a policy that has treated property as an asset for investment and that sees housing as a commodity rather than as a public good or a human right. We need to move away from that. What is the Government going to do to ensure there is a clear carrot-and-stick approach - a carrot to incentivise those who are sitting on vacant sites to build homes on them and a stick to sanction those who let sites lie idle while people queue for housing and are unable to afford to live in the city?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	187	I thank the Deputy once again for raising this important issue. I acknowledge that the public service and many private businesses are struggling to recruit and retain staff, especially in Dublin, but also all over the country. Of course, housing is a factor in that - the high cost of housing and rent and the sheer non-availability of anywhere to rent. However, it is also appropriate to mention some of the facts. Notwithstanding all that, there are 2.55 million people at work in Ireland, more than ever was the case previously. The number of teachers employed in our education sector and the number of doctors and nurses employed in our health service is many more than it was five or ten years ago and, therefore, it is not the case that we have fewer nurses working in the public health service or fewer teachers working in the public sector than was the case five or ten years ago. Those numbers continue to increase but there is a real problem recruiting and retaining people for lots of different reasons. The availability and cost of housing are part of that. I heard the Deputy's analysis. We should not forget that the housing assistance payment, HAP, was created by a Fine Gael-Labour Government. It was brought in when Labour was in government and it is important to acknowledge that as part of any analysis of housing. The HAP is very useful for people. A very important decision we made recently was to increase the income limits for social housing. This means more people will qualify for social housing, particularly working people who did not qualify previously because they earned a bit above the limit. More people will qualify for the HAP, which is a good thing because it will help them to pay their rent. Previously they got no help with their rent.  I agree with the Deputy in respect of sites that are not being developed and planning permissions that are not being activated. There is planning permission for approximately 70,000 new homes, most of which are apartments and most of which are in our cities. We need a carrot-and-stick approach because it is not always about the stick or the carrot. Sometimes there is a viability issue. We have introduced the derelict sites levy and will bring in the zoned land tax to tax land that is zoned and is not being developed. We are bringing in the vacant property tax so that if somebody has an empty property that is habitable, there will be an additional tax.  In terms of viability, which is the carrot, we have the Croí Cónaithe (cities) scheme to make apartment developments more viable and the grant of between €30,000 and €50,000 to help people turn derelict properties into habitable ones while the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is using government money to subsidise the building of student accommodation on campuses around the country so we are pursuing a carrot-and-stick approach where sites are not being developed and planning permissions are not being activated.

Labour has a proud record of seeking to deliver change to improve conditions for people and ensure we can deliver constructive ways to addresses crises that arise, particularly the housing crisis. What we sought to do with the HAP, about which he will be well aware, was to replace rent supplement, which had become a poverty trap, and to ensure a short-term way for people to address issues around housing. It was never intended to become the significant long-term issue it has become. What we have seen over the past six years has been a failure by Government to deliver on the necessary State investment to ensure the construction of necessary social and affordable homes. What we have seen instead is an overreliance on the private sector to deliver and, as a result, this developing policy that sees housing as a commodity and an asset for investment rather than as a public good and a human right.Can the Government reorient policy to ensure State intervention to deliver on the construction of social and affordable homes that are so badly needed for all those who are working in the public and private sector to ensure that we can see a future for the generations who are now priced out of housing, both rental and purchase?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	189	If the Deputy examines the legislation on the HAP, she will see that it says that once people are in receipt of the payment, their housing needs are deemed to be met, they are taken off the housing list and can only be on the transfer list. That is legislation that we did together in government. I absolutely agree that HAP is not a long-term solution, and I am absolutely in favour of greater State intervention in the housing market. The Deputy may not believe that is the case, but that is the case. I am not sure that there has ever been more State intervention in the housing market than there is now. Roughly 28,000 homes will be built this year. I would say half of them are happening because of some form of State intervention, whether it is through the social housing programme. More social housing is being provided this year than probably in any year in the history of the State through various different means. Cost rental is a new form of public housing that is being provided for the first time. Other schemes include the affordable housing schemes and the help to buy scheme. If the Deputy went through those 28,000 she would see that in some form or another, State intervention is helping or causing those homes to be built. We will step that up next year and the year after; I guarantee the Deputy that.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	190	It froze again last night, and the cold snap is set to go on through the weekend. The cost of heating a home was high in October and November. In December, it looks like it might go through the roof. Many who have not yet faced the choice of heating or eating will face it now. On Tuesday, a reporter from a Cork radio station spent the day with the local charity, Penny Dinners. He counted 900 food parcels being handed out between 9 a.m. and lunchtime at 12.45 p.m. to people from all walks of life, including students, elderly people, the homeless and workers on their lunch break. EirGrid came close to issuing an amber alert yesterday. There are reports that an alert may not be avoidable in the coming days. This is not so much caused by the cold snap as it is by the energy supply feeding frenzy of the data centres. It is reported that talks took place this week between the Government, ESB networks and EirGrid. I would like the Tánaiste to report to the House on these talks and give an assurance to the country that no household will face power cuts in the week ahead. According to The Economist magazine, 147,000 more people will die in Europe this winter, if it is an average winter, than would have been the case five years ago because of rising electricity prices. Price increases kill. Despite us having milder winters than most, Ireland had more so-called excess winter deaths than any other country in northern Europe in the 33 years after 1980. Many say those deaths were caused by the cold. It is more accurate to say that they were caused by poverty and an inability to heat homes. It is a real mark of disgrace on Governments led by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that Ireland has that terrible record. I am receiving reports of elderly people in my constituency who are not turning on their heating in this cold snap. They are terrified by the price increases and they are clearly not convinced that the budget measures will cover the increased costs. I am also receiving reports from working people and people with kids, who use pay-as-you-go meters, who are very concerned that their €200 electricity credit will be used up during this cold snap, and that they will be left in a tricky situation over Christmas. Why does the Government continue to exclude these households from the disconnection moratorium? The State's coffers are overflowing. There was €5 billion in corporation tax receipts in November alone, with a surplus of €12 billion likely. That is three times the financial firepower that has been used on cost-of-living measures. The Dáil has one week left to run before the Christmas break. Next week could, and should, be used to put in place extra emergency measures to help our people out over the Christmas period. What does the Tánaiste say to that?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	191	I wan to put on the record of the House that the Government has been advised by EirGrid and the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, that the system outlook for energy supply for this winter is similar to last winter. There will be periods when the margin between supply and demand will be very tight. We think that is particularly going to be the case over the course of the next week or two because temperatures will be very cold and the wind will not be very strong. For that reason, demand for electricity will be high but generating capacity will be stretched. I want to state clearly that we did come close to an amber alert in the past couple of days. We have not had one since August, although that may well happen. An amber alert means that there is enough electricity available. It is when there is a red alert that we get into a different scenario. That has not happened yet. We cannot guarantee that it is not going to happen. If we get to the point where there is a red alert, and the demand for electricity outstretches the amount we can generate, the first port of call will be to power down the large energy users, which are the data centres that have their own backup electricity. That is not the problem. We are not going to have a situation whereby the first call is on homes, farms or small businesses. That would be way down the line. I want to reassure people that while the likelihood of brownouts or blackouts affecting homes, farms or small businesses cannot be ruled out, they are highly unlikely because n the unlikely event that we are short of power, it will be the large energy users, such as the data centres, that will be instructed to turn on their own generating capacity, which they have and have to have. I want to make that very clear to people and, hopefully, give them some degree of reassurance about power supply over the winter period. In terms of the cost of electricity, the Government is here to help. People have received the first €200 of their bill in the form of the energy credit. There are two more instalments of that to come between now and the end of the winter. As the Deputy will be aware, we have reduced VAT on electricity and gas to 9%, the lowest it has ever been. We have introduced increases in welfare payments that people will have received over the past couple of weeks, and applications are now open for the fuel allowance. Many more people, particularly older people on low incomes, will qualify for the fuel allowance from January. We reckon 70,000 to 80,000 people will qualify for that. Applications are open, and paper applications will be open shortly. We very much encourage people to apply for that because if they are pensioners, for example, they will get the extra €12 a week from January and they will also potentially qualify for the fuel allowance for the first time. That is a further twenty-something euro a week. We would really encourage people to apply for that. Of course, other interventions are available, such as, for example, exceptional needs payments.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	192	The State is taking steps, but are the steps sufficient? According to bruegel.org, the German state is spending 7.4% of its GDP on shielding households and businesses from the energy crisis; the Irish State is spending 0.9%. In Greece, most households will have 90% of the energy price increases covered by the State. Cold snaps can make or break governments. Forty years ago, a Fine Gael-led Government was doomed in the court of public opinion when a couple of days of snow got the better of it. On Saturday week, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will swap the top jobs and then the Dáil will break for more than a month. What happens in the course of that month if there is a second or third cold snap? What happens if there is not just an amber alert but household power cuts? What happens, in the meantime, if the cost-of-living crisis becomes unbearable for a far greater number of households? No one is saying that the Dáil should meet on Christmas week, but does the Tánaiste agree that in those circumstances a break of a full month is far too long?

Everyone knows that the budget package was €11 billion and we did other things last year long before the budget, so I think those figures require further examination. The Deputy is right that Dáil is going into recess for a month. I guarantee him that the Government will not be going into recess for a month. The Government will probably take a one-week break. We will have a Cabinet meeting Christmas week and one in the first week of the new year. The Government will work during that month. We will allow people to take a few days off to spend some time with their families, perhaps five working days, but I can guarantee the Deputy that the Government will meet through the recess, including in Christmas week-----

Given that the Tánaiste is about to rotate away from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I ask him for his reflections on the programme for Government commitments to deliver on insurance reform. What changes have been made? What does the Tánaiste feel has and has not worked? What should the next Minister perhaps try? Despite all the noble words, premiums continue to float upwards and insurance continues to strangle the social, cultural and commercial life of our country. Some commercial premiums are reported to be rising 50% this year for firms with no history of claims. For others, the business liability insurance premium is up by 30%, and good luck trying to get a quote for adventure tourism. No new competition has entered the market to shake things up. We have another 15 years of the 2% levy brought about by the Quinn Insurance collapse. This costs €20 to €30 per household per year. We have something to look forward to, I suppose. We have no present public record or Circuit Court awards so we cannot see where payments are reasonable or unreasonable. The extent to which our independent Judiciary has reflected on agreed claims guidelines is a cause for concern. Too many cases still end up in the courts. The legal fees and costs are too high. The court outcomes are too unpredictable for many insurance underwriters to try their luck. The programme for Government sets out the problem clearly. Insurance costs are too high for business, motorists, households and sporting, community and voluntary groups. The programme for Government priority was to improve competition, moderate excessive payouts and compensation claims and, most important, deliver legal reform. It all sounds a bit Mary Harney-esque circa 2003, to be honest. The Dáil is waiting for the Government to move the occupiers' liability reform Bill forward. We are also waiting to see the new insurance competition office actually working and doing the job it is required to do. We have to wait to see if the Personal Injuries Resolution Board, PIRB, is more successful than the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. On that point, I was the only Deputy to table an amendment seeking a subsequent review to the PIRB legislation, which I think should still happen. We already know that some reforms already look like they are not up to the task. Perhaps we need to bite the bullet and consider a citizens’ assembly and referendum to make insurance work for our economy and society, rather than having our society working for insurance. What changes have been made that the Tánaiste feels have worked or not worked? How should the next Minister try to achieve lasting insurance reform?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	197	I thank the Deputy for raising this question. As he knows, I chaired the ministerial committee on insurance reform. I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, who has responsibility for the sector. For far too long, the cost and availability of insurance has been a big problem for businesses, consumers and community and voluntary groups. We have made good progress on implementing the action plan. I have always said, however, that the success of the plan will not be measured by the number of completed actions but, rather, by whether the reforms implemented over the lifetime of the Government result in reduced premiums and increased availability of insurance. While we have seen some signs of improvement when it comes to availability, we have only seen premiums for motorists decrease to date. There is also likely to be a lag time between implementing these reforms and people seeing the benefits. The Cabinet committee subgroup has worked very well in overseeing the action plan and 90% of the actions are now complete. I want the subgroup to continue its work next year. It will continue to be chaired at a high level by either the Taoiseach or Tánaiste. It will actively review developments in the sector, monitor price changes and engage with stakeholders. Progress we have made to date includes the new personal injury guidelines, which are being used, and the establishment of new offices to promote competition and crack down on fraud. We strengthened the law on perjury legislation to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which has been passed and now awaits signature by the President. I understand we accepted the Deputy's amendment on the review as part of that and it was a welcome contribution. We also put proposals in place to amend the law on occupiers' liability, that is, the duty of care provision, to rebalance responsibility between those who run and own premises and those who may come into it. We anticipate having that done if not in the first quarter of next year, certainly in the first half of next year. Where savings have arisen from these reforms, we expect them to be passed on to policyholders. That is the message being conveyed to the industry by Ministers and I reiterate it today. In terms of prices to date, despite the current trend in headline inflation at approximately 9%, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, indicates that motor insurance is 10% lower than a year ago and 43% lower than when it peaked in 2016. PIAB data also show a significant 44% reduction in award values for general damages and we now expect those reductions to be passed on to policyholders. We have, therefore, seen a significant reduction in motor insurance from its peak in 2016. We now want to see that when it comes to employer and public liability insurance over the course of the next year.

As the Tánaiste well knows, the costs are not coming down in the commercial insurance sector as well as had been hoped. That remains a significant problem. We are not seeing the arrival of new competition in the sector. In that respect, there is talk of buying groups being formed, whereby industry sectors come together and seek to get a discount and start underwriting. Unless they have combined insurance premiums of more than €1 million, however, there is nowhere for them to run. That is a big problem for people involved in the bouncy castle business, sports and adventure centres and the performing arts. What is the Government doing to support the smaller business? We need greater transparency regarding the fee income and insurance company profits being recorded at present. As I have advocated previously, we need strict review procedures to ensure the PIRB and, subsequently, occupiers' liability are working as desired. Most of all, we need to stop the feeding frenzy in personal injury compensation in this country. The new insurance office must sit on that in the coming year.

That has yet to go through the Seanad and I expect it will then be enacted in the first quarter of next year. We expect the President to sign the legislation to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and turn it into the Personal Injuries Resolution Board within the next couple of days. Once that is up and running, it will change the incentives. At the moment, if people do not accept the PIAB award, there is really no risk. They can go to court and will either get the same award or more. The only risk is having to wait. The legislation will change that so there is a risk in going to court. People may end up with less and with legal fees to pay. That will be a positive change. As I said, the Government is very committed to this. The changes we made around motor insurance took a year or two to result in lower premiums. We believe the changes we made in the last year or two will result in decreased premiums in the next year or two. That is what we need to see as the benchmark for success.

I must put on record again that Sinn Féin welcomes the fact that the Minister for Health accepted some of our concerns regarding the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 and has now agreed to bring forward an amendment to deal with one of the issues we raised. That is very much welcome. I am also conscious that, as I speak, this is a very difficult day for Stephen Teap, who has just agreed a settlement in relation to the laboratories and the HSE. He never gave up and never stopped battling on behalf of his wife, Irene. It is for people like Irene and Stephen Teap, Vicky Phelan and so many others that we have a huge weight of responsibility to work together and collectively get this legislation right. There are other concerns with this legislation regarding the anonymised audits that would take place in that there is no duty to inform the women or individuals in that case. It is up to the individual to seek a review if he or she so wishes. I ask the Government to engage with us and others and with the campaign group to make sure we get this legislation right on behalf of everybody who has battled for such causes.

That will allow preparation of a new amendment which will place on a statutory basis the requirement for all patients to be informed of their right to a patient requested review of cancer screening. The Minister for Health will want to engage with the Opposition on the detail of that and on the issue of audits. It is a complicated area. We are all on the same side when it comes to this issue. We all want a cancer screening system that works well. There is value in anonymised audits but risks also arise from them. It is a tricky one but there will be engagement from the Government with the Opposition on this because we want to get it right.

All of us will be thinking of their families, communities and young classmates who have suffered such devastating news of this terrible loss. There are huge levels of fear, particularly among parents and families of young children, at the rising rate of viral infections in the community and at the HSE communication asking for children with signs of illness to be kept at home. We are all conscious that our children's hospitals are under extreme pressure. On Wednesday, they were at critical capacity with so many presenting to emergency departments. It is vital that we see the urgent roll-out of free GP care to six- and seven-year-olds and the phased expansion to children aged 12 and under, as was promised in the Government's budget. We welcomed that announcement, although we in the Labour Party felt it should have gone further. At such a crucial and concerning time, we ask that the roll-out be continued apace. Can the Tánaiste give a deadline for it?

It must be any parent or family's nightmare to have a healthy child one day who gets an illness and is gone a few days later. I cannot imagine what that must be like. The Government is committed to extending free GP care for children. I never felt children should be means-tested based on their parents' incomes. One of the things the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, and I achieved together in Government was the extension of free GP care to the under-sixes. It has been extended to some other groups since, for example, carers, people with terminal illnesses and children with disabilities, but we have not managed to get beyond under-sixes and I am frustrated about that. I am sorry we did not write it into the law at the time that the age would go up by one year every year. If we had, we would be at 12 years by now. Over the last period, discussions of the consultant contract took precedence. The Minister for Health will now want to move on this issue as soon as possible.

I think the provision for career breaks is a very important one. There are lots of good reasons people may need to take a career break, often personal and family reasons, as the Deputy appreciates. The fact that the provision for career breaks exists in the public service helps encourage people into the public service and is more likely to make them stay than leave. While there may be an examination of some of the exact terms, conditions and rules around that, there is not a proposal to stop career breaks. I want to make that clear.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	208	United Against Racism is holding a rally today at 5.30 p.m. at the Spire to state clearly that we have a housing crisis, not a refugee crisis, and that refugees are welcome here. It is an expression of unity and solidarity in response to the division and hate being spread by the far right. People who arrive here are fleeing wars, climate change and brutal oppression. They are not responsible for the housing crisis, which existed well before they arrived. Blaming asylum seekers plays into the hands of those profiting from that crisis, namely, corporate landlords and big developers. Instead of being divided, we need to unite, welcome those coming here and fight together for the homes and services we all need. When will the action plan against racism be published? I understand it was submitted by the independent anti-racism committee on 27 June but still has not been brought to Government.

I note the Deputy's comments. Migrants are welcome in Ireland. If it were not for migrants, we would not be able to staff our public services. Many of the big companies that employ many people and pay a lot of tax would not be here if it they could not recruit people from abroad. Migrants enrich our society and make it a better place. It is an old-fashioned trope for centuries among people on the far right and others that if there is unemployment, crime or a housing crisis, migrants are to blame. That is totally wrong.

There is a commissioning phase to be completed over the next eight to ten weeks. The efforts of University Hospital Waterford should be recognised. It is now the stand-out hospital in the country in having the lowest trolley count and most significant impact on its long-term waiting lists, which are down by over 20% this year. However, the hospital is still struggling with resourcing. We have no cath lab beds dedicated for the day ward. I spoke to the Minister for Health last night and he said this is being progressed but we need additional effort. There has been discussion for almost a year about additional capital supports to the hospital. None of them have been provided. We have HSE estates talking about new designs but nothing has been delivered and there are no project managers or funding. I ask the Government to give us the additional cardiac day beds.

A lot of progress, as the Deputy said, has been made in Waterford in recent years, particularly with the major improvement in trolley waits. It is now one of the best performing hospitals, in part because of the good clinical leadership and management there, but also the additional resources in the Dunmore wing. With a rising and ageing population, if we do not continue to expand the hospital, we will fall backwards again. We will examine what can be done to extend bed capacity. I am pleased to hear the second cath lab is nearing completion. It has been a long saga. I am determined to work with the Deputy, the Minister for Health and everyone involved to make sure it is commissioned and operating if not in the early part, certainly in the first half of next year.

How can we have a good hospital system if the HSE investigates itself? Why can we not have an independent body to investigate serious complaints against hospitals like University Hospital Limerick? Some 70 health professionals - the Tánaiste is also a health professional - came forward on Q-Pulse to report incidents. Some 140 incidents related to one medical practitioner, yet none of them has been investigated. When they are investigated, it is by the HSE, which has people on every board. No matter which way you go, there are HSE representatives, past and present, on it. We need an independent public body to investigate serious incidents in our hospitals.

It has been successful in running two of those, notwithstanding much adversity. It has been less successful with the heritage sites and the group's management seems to be of the view that it is not a good fit with the Shannon Group, which has a commercial remit. Clare County Council has offered to take over these sites.They have identified capital needs and they have set out a detailed paper on what those needs are. I have written to four Ministers and to the Taoiseach to ask for a high-level person to be appointed to bring them together. There are four Ministers involved, and it is bouncing around between them. There are State agencies, such as Fáilte Ireland, and of course Clare County Council, involved. It now looks like the deal is in jeopardy and there is a lot of toing and froing in the media between the Shannon Airport Group and Clare County Council. Does the Tánaiste, as incoming Taoiseach, think that we now need to appoint somebody high level to bring these groups together to get this over the line to bring finality?

Deputy Carey has also been briefing me on it in the past couple of weeks. It is a good thing Clare County Council is agreeing to take on these heritage sites. They will need money because work needs to be done on those sites and we want to bring them up to standard. There is a process ongoing to resolve this. I am not personally across it, so I do not know whether the right thing to do at this stage is to appoint an arbitrator or not. However, I do understand that this has been going on for a long time and that it has been bounced through different public bodies and that is not a satisfactory situation. I will look into it again and we will try to get to a resolution sooner rather than later.

It is fitting that I raise again this week, given the announcement in relation to Kaftrio this week and the disappointment that that has caused for that cohort of patients. The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, has previously given me a commitment that he will publish the Mazars report into the reimbursement process and that is welcome. While I welcome that, there is so much more we can do, including risk sharing and conditional reimbursement. All these steps are being taken in other EU countries and we are laggards in that regard. I am just asking that when the Tánaiste assumes the office of Taoiseach in the coming weeks he will give this issue the attention it deserves and will prioritise it.

I agree that this is an issue that we need to turn around, next year hopefully. I have served as Minister for Health, I am a Deputy and I am Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and I find it very hard to explain to parents and to patients why there are treatments that are available in Britain or in other European countries that are not reimbursed here. I find it hard as a Deputy as well as a doctor. As the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I find it hard to explain to companies why medicines that they produce here and develop here are not available to patients here. We have seen some big improvements in the past couple of years. Money has been set aside that has been dedicated to new medicines. I think 30 or 50 molecules were approved in the last year, but it is clearly still a problem, and it is a matter in which I will take a personal interest.

The flight paths that are being operated are not the ones that were agreed. Houses were insulated to mitigate against the noise of low-flying planes. Incredibly, many of those homes are not now on the flight path, while hundreds of others, as well as schools and businesses which were never insulated, have to live with the noise nuisance of low-flying planes for hours each day. This appears to be a spectacular error by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, the IAA, and by Fingal County Council who have responsibility here. What measures is the Government taking to address this? Will the Tánaiste ensure that the DAA is not allowed to operate contrary to its permissions?

The remuneration package that is currently on the table needs to take into account that CE supervisors have not had a pay rise in 13 years, which means that their pay does not now reflect their level of responsibility. When the issue is raised here, the answer is that the Department is not their employer. Supervisors were never asked not to be seen as public servants and they never gave up the right to be seen as such. CE supervisors were never included in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) No. 2 Act 2009 and, although they were due an increase at that same time, they never received it. Therefore, I believe that they have taken a pay cut. Their workload has doubled in 13 years and, given the recent increase in the cost of living, they cannot afford to live on their wages. The budget has done very little to alleviate their plight. Pro rata, they are working for less money than many of the people they are supervising on the scheme. They are providing a vital scheme and they are being shortchanged. What are we doing for them to make sure that they get their proper wages?

The Department of Social Protection has been invited to that conciliation process. We should engage in that process, and we are ready to go into that and to make an offer. Before we can do that, we need the backing of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. We need its sanction to take the next step. We should do it as soon as possible.

On Monday evening, a constituent phoned the helpline at 6 p.m. for a sick baby. She phoned six times and she was put hold between ten and 34 minutes before being cut off. She finally got an answer at 9:49 p.m. to be told that there were no appointments left and that she would have to go to her own GP the next morning. She expressed concern about her child, and she was told that she could go to A&E if she wanted. She rang KDoc in Carlow at 10 p.m., was answered straight away and she was given an appointment at 11.20 p.m. She was lucky that she could go, that she could give a relative’s address and that she could drive the 50-minute journey. Others may not be so lucky. Will the Tánaiste please ensure that the right resources are directed towards the Kildare service? We have heard people this morning talking about strep A and the concerns of parents.

We are doing our best to ensure people know about it through business organisations, through the Revenue Commissioners and through accountancy practices, as accountants will want to let their customers know it is available.

A national survey indicated that 60% of them intend to leave soon. A new fire station recently opened in New Ross, which is welcome. However, it cost €1.6 million and due to staffing it is only operating as a one-pump station and must rely on other stations such as Enniscorthy, which is at least half an hour away. That is a long time to wait if a person has a serious house fire. What is the Government's position on improving the conditions and further recruitment of retained firefighters? At present they are on call 24-7 with little or no incentives or prospect of promotion and are haemorrhaging experienced personnel who are not being replaced.

Deputy Richmond raised this matter with the Minister of State yesterday. The situation with this drug is slightly unclear. This condition, as the Tánaiste will be aware, causes extreme vomiting in pregnancy and is dangerous for both the baby and the mother. In this year's budget, the Minister announced that the drug would be reimbursed and that is welcome. However, it is only reimbursed when prescribed by a consultant and not a GP. The condition generally begins in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Most women will only see a consultant after 12 weeks of pregnancy. The women who have contacted me, and probably other Deputies, say they want GPs to be allowed to prescribe the drug so that it becomes accessible and will be reimbursed more quickly than it is at present.

I do not know the rationale for not allowing GPs to prescribe it. GPs routinely deal with pregnancies of all kinds, especially in early pregnancy. I am not sure whether there is a good reason for it and being unaware, I will not comment any further. I will certainly ask my office to take it up with the Minister for Health's office and revert to Deputy Kenny with a further reply.

She was running a scheme with 32 participants, supporting 20 sponsors, covering an area of 85 km and responsible for €500,000 in Government funding through the scheme. She was working without the support of an assistant supervisor because they have not been able to recruit anyone due to poor pay. She is not the only one. I heard what was said with respect to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I ask that this is treated with a sense of urgency before more good people go. These are critical supports and services in our communities and many of the services would not exist without the schemes. I ask that all schemes be reviewed, including the RSS and Tús, because they are so important to our communities. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform needs to give the go-ahead for engagement to begin. A sense of urgency is needed in this matter.

There are approximately 1,200 CE supervisors and assistant supervisors around the country. They provide an enormous service to their communities. They open pathways to work for people, provide a social inclusion service locally for people who would not otherwise be looked after and run key local services. We need to look after them. As the Deputy has said and as I said earlier, we need to look after Tús and RSS supervisors as well. We have had quite a bit of communication with unions this year. It is being dealt with by the WRC now and we are waiting for an invitation to a conciliation process. It is important we engage in that conciliation process but there is no point in us walking into the room unless we have sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to negotiate in a realistic way with some funds.

It is three months since Mahsa Amini was killed in police custody. The regime made an announcement at the weekend that the morality police had been disbanded. According to those activists, this is utterly untrue. It is propaganda and another young activist was executed by the regime this morning. On behalf of that movement, I ask the Government to express its solidarity with the movement and, in concrete terms, to give a commitment that it will not reopen the embassy in Tehran while the regime continues its brutal onslaught against women, mainly, but also the entire community. That regime is not acceptable and has to go. The Government should express its solidarity in some way, today and in the long term.

Regarding our plans to reopen an embassy in Tehran, a chargé d'affaires has been appointed and is representing Ireland in Iran from the German embassy. In general, we take the view that it is better to have lines of communication with other countries even if those countries have different values from ours. That is why we have embassies in many parts of the world that are not democratic. We think it is better to be able to talk than not to be able to talk at all. However, the decision on whether we will open a physical embassy in Iran is under review, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	246	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:Proposal for a Council Decision on the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union in the Partnership Council established by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the other part, regarding the extension of the interim period referred to in Article 552(11) of that Agreement during which the United Kingdom may derogate from the obligation to delete Passenger Name Record data of passengers after their departure from the United Kingdom,a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 21st November, 2022.I am speaking today on behalf of the Minister for Justice on a motion referring to a draft proposal by the Council of the European Union to facilitate continued exchange of passenger name records, PNR, data under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, with the United Kingdom. PNR data is information provided by passengers during the reservation and booking of tickets and when checking in on flights. The content of PNR data varies depending on the information given by the passenger and may include, for example, dates of travel, travel itinerary and contact details such as address and phone number. The exchange of this information is to assist in the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. The exchange of these data is an essential tool for law enforcement, including countering terrorist threats across the EU and, of course, is of particular value to law enforcement co-operation between Ireland and the UK. Deputies will be aware that if Ireland wishes to take part in an EU measure with a legal basis that falls under Title 5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution is required. As the Council intends to adopt this measure by 19 December 2022 at the latest, it is therefore necessary to secure Oireachtas approval as a matter of urgency and, in light of this, I would ask Deputies to pass this motion without a vote. The proposal provides for an extension of the special arrangements currently in place in the TCA, to allow the continued sharing of PNR data with the UK, which in the absence of a decision to extend, will expire at the end of this year on 31 December 2022. The extension will allow the existing special arrangements to continue to run until the end of 2023. This measure is purely technical and makes no policy changes in this area. As the extension needs to be in place by the end of the year, the latest it can be adopted at an EU Council is 19 December 2022. Regrettably, this has put us under pressure to complete the opt-in process as soon as possible. However, as I mentioned, I can assure the Deputies that the measure is purely technical in nature and does not introduce or amend any policy matters. In essence, it provides for a continuation of the existing arrangements until the end of 2023. The Government sincerely regrets the lack of time given to the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider this matter, which was not within the Government's control. Unfortunately, the European Commission was unable to produce the draft proposal earlier than 21 November due to the requirement for internal consultations. I trust that Deputies understand the urgency and necessity of passing this motion today. The TCA between the EU and the UK includes arrangements for exchanges of passenger name records and the protection of such data shared by EU airline carriers to the UK. An essential precondition for the arrangements, as set out in the TCA, is that the UK applies data protection standards essentially equivalent to those set out in the EU's standards and complies with specific additional data protection standards. While EU member states may retain PNR data for a period of five years, the TCA imposes a requirement on the UK to delete PNR data after one year. This is due to the change in the UK's status from EU member state to a third country. The UK's PNR data processing systems were originally configured to comply with the requirements of EU law. Since its departure from the EU, substantial progress has been made on the UK's system. However, further work is required to complete the necessary technical adjustments required to guarantee compliance with the requirements of the TCA. In the meantime, the UK continues to operate additional interim-period safeguards manually. This includes operating a manual risk assessment process, and manually logging and putting beyond use PNR data that should be considered as deleted. The UK Information Commissioner's Office has confirmed that it is satisfied that the safeguards are in place. Because of these circumstances, Article 552 of the TCA provides for a derogation from this requirement to enable the UK to adapt its systems to ensure compliance. The TCA allows for two such yearly extensions until the end of 2023. A Council decision, adopted in December 2021 extended the special arrangements until the end of December 2022. Ireland exercised its option under Protocol No. 21 to take part in the adoption and application of that measure. As this derogation ends in December 2022, the Commission has published this proposal in order to facilitate a further extension of this special arrangement up to 31 December 2023, thus allowing the continued sharing of PNR data with the UK. It is expected that by 31 December 2023 the United Kingdom will have finalised all technical adjustments necessary to enable its PNR processing systems to delete PNR data in accordance with Article 552(4) of the TCA. Without the extension to the derogation period, PNR data would cease to be shared between the EU and the UK from midnight on 31 December 2022. As Deputies will understand, if this were to happen it could potentially have serious repercussions in the fight against terrorism, and could impact on the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases. As mentioned earlier, the proposal presented by the Commission uses the legal basis of Article 87(2)(a), making this a measure under Title 5 of the TFEU. Thus Protocol 21 applies and Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution is required for Ireland to opt into the measure. The views of the Office of the Attorney General were sought and the legal advice received has confirmed that Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution is required. The effective implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is an EU priority and Ireland will play our full part in that. Ireland's role in the EU has changed in recent times and will continue to evolve in the coming years. Full implementation of the TCA is necessary for us to not only play our part as an EU member state but also to ensure that our post-Brexit relationship with the UK continues to grow and develop. Part of this relationship is ensuring that the safety and security of our citizens is protected and this measure is necessary to do that. I trust that the House can support the exercise of Ireland's opt-in in respect of this measure. Ongoing exchange of PNR information with the UK is entirely within Ireland's strategic interest. I thank Deputies for their consideration of this important matter.
#RuairiOmurchu	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-party	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-dob	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	247	I accept that the Government was not responsible for the timeline. We obviously support this absolutely necessary proposal on PNR data. Once more we are dealing with the outworkings of the TCA between Britain and the European Union and the outworkings of what has been a disastrous Brexit. I am hardly the first person to say that on the floor of this Chamber. Exercising our parliamentary sovereignty is key part of our powers here and surrendering in any area of co-operation, even one like this which we all support, should be something we do reluctantly. A debate like this is still very welcome. I would like to debate this motion in the context of recent developments with the collapse of the so-called European super-cartel.Many of these matters are subject to ongoing court proceedings and, therefore, we cannot deal with specifics here but myself and my colleagues have argued that criminals are increasingly co-operating on a cross-border and international basis, with a significant level of sophistication we have not seen previously. Law enforcement, accordingly, needs to become just as sophisticated. Whatever tools and powers are necessary in this regard, we will support. This appears to be very much what is happening now following a number of key arrests across Europe, and the co-operation of officials in the US as well. It seemed one particular group of organisations were thumbing their nose at the law to a degree that they were biting off more than they could chew. That is no longer the case and action has been taken. Like many of these cases, when we are dealing with the issue of drug dealing, a significant part of what needs to be done is to ensure international co-operation in criminal justice matters, and all the sophisticated tools that are necessary. A wider issue needs to be dealt with and many Members are supportive of the citizens' assembly on drugs use and would like that to be in place as quickly as possible. We need to be mindful, however, of the potential effects of a power vacuum emerging within the market for illicit drugs. We have all seen that wherever an entity, organisation or gang has been taken out of operation, it has been replaced very quickly. As many people who work in addiction services have said previously, they have yet to have an addict come in to talk about the difficulty they have had in being able to obtain cocaine. That is the reality of the world we live in and is why the citizens' assembly is vital. A power vacuum could emerge within that market and we are all aware that there have been a number of shootings this week, which has raised concerns. The fear always is that further violence is on the way. I hope that the Minister for Justice is liaising with the Garda Commissioner on this. We also need to take time to assess the success of policies targeting organised crime to ensure a new generation does not emerge. In dealing with the issue of organised crime, it is difficult not to deal with the wider issues relating to drug addiction, embedded poverty and all the multi-agency supports that we have failed to put in place in previous times, and that we are paying for now. We have to set the correct framework in train so that we can avoid some of this into the future. There will always be a need to ensure that we have those necessary tools from a criminal justice point of view. This is especially the case in respect of Britain, given the unique position we are in. The disastrous Tory Brexit must not be allowed to create a scenario where Britain becomes a safe haven for organised crime. Myself and other colleagues have pointed out before that Britain was among the most frequent users of these databases. However, this is just one more consequence the British Government has had to deal with resulting from its absolutely disastrous actions. It is right and proper that co-operation continues ahead of any final status agreement. The motion amounts to a derogation from certain requirements and a sunset clause will kick in at the end of 2023. True to form, throughout the Brexit process we will have to see if the British Government will have its own arrangements in place by then. I do not believe that anyone would accept to wager a great deal of money on such a bet. Finally, we need to be mindful of civil liberties concerns. The information contained in these databases is expansive and sensitive. There are a number of issues with the operation of bodies such as Frontex, Europol, and Eurodoc. That is not to say that co-operation is not the right thing to do but it must be ensured that we have correct level of accountability and due diligence because this must be a part of any criminal justice initiative. We support this opt-in but, as I said earlier, this is us dealing with extra homework on the basis of the disastrous Brexit.  For the day that is in it, I will also put on the record that as much as we have had better mood music with Rishi Sunak in place, we have not exactly seen the sort of movement we would like to see in the sorting out of the wider issue of the Irish protocol. The British Government is still threatening on some level with the protocol Bill, the Nationality and Borders Act and the disastrous amnesty legislation, which is very much about Britain not having to deal with any questions in respect of its role in the North and, basically, its dirty war in Ireland.  All of us support any streamlining that is required in respect of the protocol. Everybody wants sensible solutions. The European Commission, and Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič, have bent over backwards. I have no doubt that that will be done into the future. Hopefully, the British Government will be in a place where it wants to do a deal.  We may have a change in respect of the Taoiseach's office in the near future, but I would also like to think that we will have a change in the very near future in the moves we need to take. Whether people think this is a good idea, the constitutional question is out in the open at this point in time. We are 100 years on from a lost opportunity. We are all remembering events that happened during a disastrous Civil War. Liam, Ruairí, Dick and Joe were executed 100 years ago today. There was a great amount of hurt and pain and a failure across what had been the leadership of the republican movement. We now have an opportunity to build something better and to build a new Ireland. First, we need to ensure that the Irish protocol is bedded down. Second, we also need to ensure that the DUP is left in no doubt that there is only one road in play, which is to deliver an Executive, get a working Assembly up and running and to deal with the politics of the cost-of-living crisis and the many other crises that we are also dealing with here. The Government needs to establish a citizens' assembly or some sort of forum, which can be as expansive as necessary, so that we can have the conversations as to what this new Ireland will look like. That is a vital piece of work that needs to be done.  I call it a citizens' assembly but I have no major difficulty if we expand the shared island dialogue into something that it is not at the minute to deal with those particular issues and, beyond that, do all of those necessary preparatory pieces in planning for Irish unity so that we do not have a disastrous Brexit-type referendum.  I may have gone off on a tangent, but I believe the Minister of State may not disagree with everything I have said, and that he might be quite agreeable with quite a lot of it. Hopefully, we will see those changes in the near future. We support the motion but, unfortunately, we are dealing with just one of the many outworkings of what has been a disastrous Brexit. 
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	248	I thank the Deputy for his contribution, to which I have carefully listened, particularly his comments on the motion, the broader issue and the historical context. I am one of those people who understands where we have come from in the past 100 years but I am equally as interested in the future generation. Any time I speak about these issues, I like to talk about where we are and how we want to make Ireland a better place for the future generations, notwithstanding the fact that every one of our families had a deep involvement in the issues that happened 100 years ago. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, this measure is essential to ensure continued close law enforcement co-operation between the EU and the UK. It is vital that we meet the highest standards possible when it comes to the investigation and prosecution of crimes and the ongoing transferring of PNR data helps to ensure that. This extension of the special arrangements currently in place in the TCA will allow the continued sharing of PNR data with the UK, which, in the absence of a decision to extend, will expire at the end of this year. The extension will run until the end of 2023.  It is expected that by then that the UK will have finalised - I take the Deputy's word of caution and we will have to wait and see on that point - all technical adjustments necessary to enable its PNR processing systems to delete PNR data in accordance with Article 552(4) of the TCA.I acknowledge the Deputy's comment on the need to deal with criminal justice matters at an EU level. Organised crime does not stop at our borders and it is important that we have these measures in place right across the EU and with the assistance of the UK. The Deputy also mentioned the citizens' assembly on drug use and the fact that citizens' rights must be protected in all of these measures as well. I concur with him on that. To a great extent, in the first instance the drugs issue is a health issue, but that can ultimately lead to criminal justice issues. However, at its core, it is a health issue and we must all look at it in that format. The continuation of these special arrangements, which will facilitate ongoing exchange of PNR information with the UK, is key to co-operation between the EU and the UK on law enforcement. I commend this motion to the House.
Once again, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank the Deputy for his contribution.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	249	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." On behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I am happy to have the opportunity to introduce the Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to set out a system of controls on the abstraction and impoundment of water to protect our water environment and to ensure compliance with Ireland's responsibilities under the water framework directive. Article 11(3) of the directive requires member states to implement measures to control the abstraction of fresh surface water and groundwater, and impoundment of fresh surface water. This provision of the directive has not been transposed into Irish law before now, and the Bill is a significant milestone in Ireland's overall environmental protection measures. Unfortunately, the absence of a comprehensive and modern abstraction management and control regime in Ireland has led to the EU to open infringement proceedings against Ireland for failure to fully transpose the directive. Enactment of the Bill will form a considerable part of Ireland's response to these proceedings. In general, abstraction pressures on our water system are relatively low compared to some of the more significant pressures identified in the Draft River Basin Management Plan 2022-2027. Detailed assessments of our water bodies by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the local authority waters programme, LAWPRO, as part of our river basin management planning cycles will aim to refine and identify the most significant abstraction pressures. This will give us a better picture of the nature of these pressures and the water bodies most affected. Changes to our climate and meteorological pattern in recent years have also given rise to concerns over the management of our water resources. Not only do we want to have waters of sufficient quality, we also want sufficient quantity of water to supply our growing population centres and industries and to help us to continue to produce high quality foods on our land. At a high level, the Bill provides for a modern registration, licensing and control regime for water abstractions. Its focus is on the largest abstractions in Ireland, and those smaller abstractions that may be causing short-term or ongoing environmental damage. It is designed to be based on the risk of a water body not meeting its environmental objectives under the water framework directive and is not intended to control all abstractions. This risk-based approach is in keeping with the principles of the directive and is similar to the approach taken in other EPA environmental licensing regimes. The proposed system of registration and licensing is to be administered by the EPA, with local authorities also maintaining an ongoing enforcement role. The Bill also includes provisions relating to water impoundment infrastructure associated with abstractions. For example, where a dam or other barrier is interrupting the flow of a river for the purposes of abstracting water, the controls in the licence will extend to the operation of the impounding infrastructure. I will reiterate that for the benefit of others. I do not normally deal with matters relating to this Department and last night when I came across the word "abstractions" and the associated term, "impoundments", I had to consult Mr. Google to find out exactly what it was. In fairness, that was before I got the full briefing from the Department. For people listening in, they must be a little bit curious as to what we are talking about. Abstraction is sinking a well and getting water out of the ground or from a river or reservoir. Impoundment is essentially a technical word for what one might call a dam on a river or lake. If I am not correct in my layman's interpretation, Members can feel free to correct me. I want to explain what we are talking about, as some people will not understand the technical words we use here today. The most significant abstractor of water in Ireland is Irish Water. Upwards of 80% of the current registered water abstractions are drinking water abstractions operated by Irish Water. The provisions of the Bill will allow Irish Water to operate these abstractions within a framework that protects the quantity of water available, and will ensure that the EPA can regulate these abstractions appropriately. In particular, the provisions of the Bill will allow for a streamlined, comprehensive and robust application process for the water supply project from the Parteen Basin to supply the eastern and midlands region. It modernises the legal framework around significant abstractions and will ensure that appropriate levels of oversight and control will be applied to that proposed abstraction. The powers provided for Irish Water in respect of its abilities to interfere with water rights where it proposes to carry out a public abstraction are retained from the currently operating Water Supplies Act 1942, and are required to be retained to allow for the repeal of that Act. No new power is being granted to Irish Water in this respect. Where Irish Water proposes to carry out a public abstraction, a robust objections procedure is provided for. Where there are materially adverse effects on water rights arising as a result of the carrying out of a public abstraction by Irish Water, the Bill provides for a clear compensation framework. The issue of the thresholds for registration of water abstractions was raised during Seanad scrutiny of this Bill, specifically in respect of the lowering of the registration threshold to 10 cu. m. The Department gave the issue of the registration threshold careful consideration. This included the recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, report, which resulted in changes to the Bill to give the Minister the power to alter thresholds on the recommendation of the EPA. I note again that the choice of thresholds is based on scientific evidence and data and this system is risk based. It does not seek to impose requirements where they are not necessary on environmental grounds, especially in the resource intensive area of licensing. The Department is confident that the EPA will have the ability under this system to fully protect our water bodies and enable them to meet their environmental objectives established under the river basin management plan in line with the water framework directive. The EPA estimates that the registration threshold of 25 cu. m per day captures 99.5% of the total volume of water abstracted on any given day, and that a reduction to 10 cu. m per day would account for additional registration of just 0.1% of water abstracted in the State, while simultaneously resulting in an estimated additional 10,000 registrations. If we were to go with the lower rate, we would cover 99.6% of the volume of water abstracted, whereas going with the 25 cu. m per day would cover 99.5%. That obviates the need for approximately 10,000 additional registrations being continued.The lower rate would result in a five-fold increase in the administrative burden on the EPA in undertaking the assessment of significance under section 18 and potentially lead to delays in the licensing of the more high-risk abstractions. The Department is confident that the EPA will have the ability under this system to protect our water bodies and enable them to meet their environmental objectives established under the river basin management plan in line with the water framework directive. I will now elaborate on some of the Bill's provisions. This is a relatively detailed Bill comprising 11 Parts, 116 sections and one Schedule. It is largely a technical Bill. Part 1, covering sections 1 to 7, addresses preliminary and general matters. These include the Title of the Bill, arrangements for bringing the Bill into operation and standard provisions. It also includes in section 7 some existing legislative measures that are being repealed to allow for the strengthened legal provisions of the Bill. Part 2 confers regulation-making powers on the Minister to regulate unlicensed abstractions. This will include abstractions below the registration threshold and those awaiting a decision on a licence application. Local authorities will be responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations under Part 9. Part 3 details the exemptions from the requirements of the Bill that may be applied by the Minister by way of regulation. This covers exemptions allowed for under the water framework directive. Part 4 includes sections 11 to 13 and provides for the maintenance of a register of abstractions over a threshold of 25 cu. m per day by the EPA. These provisions replace the provisions of the European Union (Water Policy) (Abstractions Registration) Regulations 2018, which are repealed under section 7 of the Bill. Part 5 is the most substantial Part and sets out the principal licensing provisions for those abstractions that require a licence. Sections 14 to 20 contain the main provisions relating to abstractions that require a licence. These include the circumstances in which an abstractor is required to apply for a licence, the requirements on the EPA to assess these applications and the powers to grant or refuse a licence. They also provide for the Minister to vary the thresholds for licensing. Sections 21 to 28 address licence applications that require environmental impact assessments, EIAs, to be carried out. These sections place particular emphasis on the procedures to be followed in determining an EIA, the level of detail required to make a full assessment and, most important, the co-ordination of EIAs between the EPA and the relevant planning authorities. Sections 29 to 36 relate to licence applications for abstractions that may be subject to retrospective EIAs. A retrospective EIA is required in those cases where the EPA determines that an EIA was required and should have been made prior to or after the commencement of the abstraction. For a variety of reasons, an EIA may not have been undertaken at the time the abstraction commenced. The processes set out in these sections of the Bill ensure that the appropriate EIA is undertaken and all legal obligations are met and adhered to. Sections 37 to 45 provide for combined abstraction licence applications. These are applications that comprise existing abstractions - those operating prior to the commencement of the Bill - and revised abstractions that will increase the existing abstraction rates. The purpose of these sections is to ensure that the existing abstraction is sufficiently assessed in terms of any retrospective EIA and to provide for an equally robust assessment of the future proposed abstraction rate. Scenarios like this may arise where population growth predictions necessitate an increase in drinking water supplies. The next chapter of Part 5 includes sections 46 to 55 and provides for a number of different requirements to complement the previous licensing sections. This chapter includes provisions around applications for joint licences, surrenders, transfers, reviews, revocations and suspensions. These provisions are all necessary to allow the EPA and licenceholders sufficient scope to address changing circumstances as they arise and enhance the ability of the EPA to manage the risks associated with these changes. The final few sections of Part 5 are sections 56 to 59. These contain miscellaneous provisions relating to licensing that provide for judicial reviews of decisions, regulation-making powers for the Minister, EPA guidelines for the licensing process and minor amendments to the licences. Part 6 focuses solely on abstractions by Irish Water. Sections 60 to 73 focus on the powers of Irish Water to take a public abstraction, provisions for objections to those abstractions, a decision process for An Bord Pleanála on objections, and provisions to address claims for compensation. These provisions for compensation are likely to be used where a person feels that his or her rights in respect of water would be materially adversely affected by a public abstraction by Irish Water. Sections 74 to 82 set out the provisions for Irish Water to undertake temporary abstractions to supplement or replace existing abstractions on a short-term basis. This may arise in the event of a severe drought, an infrastructural failure or a contamination of the raw water source. These temporary abstractions are confined to eight weeks duration, with the possibility of a single eight-week extension being granted. Section 80 provides for the Minister to make an order, or not, to exempt a temporary abstraction from the licensing requirements in emergency circumstances. Any such order would only be considered on the basis of a civil emergency where the abstraction was for the sole purpose of responding to the emergency. As with other temporary abstractions, the same eight-week time limit applies to an emergency abstraction under section 80. Section 82 provides for appeals and compensation related to Irish Water temporary or emergency abstractions. Section 83 puts a framework around Irish Water abstractions from ESB reservoirs, with a particular focus on ensuring legal agreements are in place between the parties before an abstraction licence can be granted. Part 7 relates to Waterways Ireland and its statutory functions and to abstractions from navigable waters and canals. This Part ensures that Waterways Ireland has significant input into EPA assessments of abstractions from navigable waters operated by Waterways Ireland. It also provides that any licensed abstraction from a canal can only be undertaken with the agreement of Waterways Ireland. Part 8 is a short Part with just one section. It addresses the operation and safety of hydroelectric schemes and provides that the EPA shall have regard to the functions of the ESB when considering an application for an abstraction licence associated with a hydroelectric scheme. Part 9 contains the principal enforcement provisions of the Bill. Sections 88 to 96 set out the enforcement functions of local authorities and the EPA, including their powers to appoint authorised persons to undertake enforcement actions. Sections 97 to 102 provide for the issuing of compliance notices and the requirements on those that receive a compliance notice. These notices can be issued by either the local authority or the EPA for a number of different offences, including abstracting water without a valid licence or breaching the conditions of an existing licence. The notices can also require the owner of the abstraction to take measures to protect the environment and-or to meet the environmental objectives of the water body concerned. Sections 104 to 109 further set out the offences throughout the Bill, the powers of prosecution and the penalties associated with a conviction for an offence. Part 10 contains just four sections that relate to miscellaneous and transitional provisions. The transitional provisions are in place to ensure the integrity of the legal framework following commencement of the Bill and the repeal of the Water Supplies Act 1942, certain provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 and the 2018 abstraction registration regulations. Part 11 contains three sections that set out the required amendments to the Canals Act 1986, the Shannon Navigation Act 1990 and the Planning and Development Act 2000. The most substantial of these is section 116, which amends the Planning and Development Act. The amendments insert references to water abstractions and the need for consultation in certain circumstances between planning authorities and the EPA, including on EIAs. The Schedule lists the public bodies referred to in the Bill. I thank the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the detailed pre-legislative scrutiny that was afforded to the general scheme of the Bill in October 2020 and its subsequent report in January 2021. I am glad to say that the recommendations set out in the committee's report played an important role in the development of the policy underlying this Bill. I look forward to Deputies' contributions as we progress the Bill through the parliamentary process.

This Bill, despite its technical nature, is important.Since the water framework directive was introduced in 2000, there has been an obligation on this State to know something very simple, namely, how much water is extracted from our natural water sources at any given time across the country. Why is that important? If you do not know what is being abstracted, you cannot manage it. You cannot manage it to ensure that communities and businesses, including tourism and natural wildlife businesses, have access to water and that water is being properly maintained from an environmental and ecosystems point of view. In an era of climate change in which droughts and floods are becoming increasingly prevalent, including in our own country, the idea that we are only now beginning to consider asking people to tell us how much water is being extracted from the water table is truly astounding. This is no abstract matter, if Members will excuse the play on words. As the Minister of State will know, given his own constituency, flooding and drought are real issues that have huge impacts on communities, businesses, wildlife and biodiversity. For these reasons, it is exceptionally disappointing that, despite the committee having given the Government this pre-legislative scrutiny report two years ago, we are getting 90 minutes next week to consider amendments.

The Government often blames committees, arguing that it takes them too long to do pre-legislative scrutiny and that is why there is a rush at the end. Our detailed, considered report has been with the Government for two years, yet it is only now that we are getting to debate the Bill, with only a tiny amount of time provided to discuss what will no doubt be a significant number of amendments from a number of Opposition Deputies. I mean this with no disrespect. I thank the Minister of State for thanking the joint committee for its hard work in doing the pre-legislative scrutiny. The problem is that the Government has not included in the Bill any of the key recommendations in the pre-legislative scrutiny report. Thanks are all well and good but we would much prefer if the Minister of State’s party colleague and his officials listened to us and the key recommendations we made. The thresholds are wrong. I will return to that in a moment. The registration threshold and the licensing threshold are not low enough and that will come back to haunt us. There are real problems with the level of compliance in the Bill with a range of legal obligations, including the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive, the water framework directive, the Aarhus Convention and others. There are also legally questionable sections in the Bill in terms of exemptions and the possibility for people to continue abstracting large volumes of water with licences, even where it has been shown that such abstraction is causing significant damage to the water quality and, ultimately, to communities, businesses and the environment. The Minister of State will not know this but one of the significant things the committee did was to ask the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, to give its view on the level of compliance of this legislation with our EU legal responsibilities. The OPLA’s report was really damning. It is very rare that our committee has made such a request when we do so, the OPLA is often very cautious in its report. The Oireachtas has a right to know in summary form what that advice was.  On public participation, the OPLA’s advice was that with respect to the relevant section of the Bill, while the language of the EIA directive is being used, it does not appear to be in compliance with the public participation requirements of the directive. That is with respect to the general scheme but I see no change in the Bill itself. The advice referred to the thresholds, one of the central weaknesses of the Bill. It described them as being arbitrary and solely based on size and stated that they prevent environmental impact assessment for existing abstractions to occur below 25 cu. m and proposed abstractions below 250 cu. m which, in the view of the OPLA, the European Court of Justice had held to be contrary to the EIA directive as well. Over again in its advice, the OPLA listed instances where it genuinely believed that this legislation, albeit in the general scheme, was not in compliance. Again, because we will have such limited time, it will be virtually impossible for us to have an exchange with the Minister to allow him to convince us that the very serious legal concerns the OPLA had with the general scheme have been satisfied in the Bill. It will be virtually impossible to do that in the short time provided. What is the problem with the thresholds? Let us picture what we are talking about here. What is 25 cu. m? I think that people would like to know what it is because 25 cu. m does not mean much to most of us. It is the daily usage of water of 2,250 people. We are saying that below that amount, there is no requirement to register. Registering is not complicated. It is done online in the North where the threshold is 10 cu. m, which we recommended in our pre-legislative scrutiny report. It is very easy, administratively simple and there is no cost to register.  The licensed threshold is 2,000 cu. m, which is the daily water usage of 18,000 people. What we are saying is that where less water than that is being used, say the daily usage of 17,000 or 16,000 people, there is no licensing requirement whatever. That is beyond belief if we want to be compliant with a directive which is about the proper management and maintenance of the quality of our water for all of us – human, animals and ecosystems – that depend on it. The worst aspect of this is that the proposal in our pre-legislative scrutiny report is what exists 90 miles up the road. This has been in existence in the North of Ireland, Scotland and many other European jurisdictions. If it could be done up there and was good enough up there, then why not here? Would it not make more sense for us to have a single abstraction regime with single thresholds North and South? The fact we do not have that is deeply concerning. Registration is just registration; it is the licences that are the key. I note the Minister of State did not indicate how much water will be covered by the licences as a percentage of the total amount of water in the State because that is the figure that is really important. The idea of providing indefinite licences is enormously problematic. Surely there should be mechanisms for review and withdrawal of licences if the proper management of our water system requires it. The idea of full transposition of the environmental impact assessment directive and retrospective environmental impact assessment definitions on existing large-scale abstractions is absent from the Bill and hugely problematic. I could be wrong on this too, and I look forward to the Minister of State correcting me at any stage if I am, but there is no provision in the Bill to refuse a licence application from an existing abstractor, even if there is clear evidence from the Environmental Protection Agency that such a refusal would be the most appropriate course of action both for the protection of our water system and compliance with the directive. The other major issue the committee addressed was the resourcing of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is an organisation for which I have enormous respect. It does very important independent work and regularly sounds the alarm at the Government’s failure to properly manage all aspects of our water system, from the natural water courses and river basins to our drinking water and wastewater. It was patently clear to the committee that it does not have the resources to even administer the limited scheme before us today. If we are serious, 22 years after the introduction of the European directive designed to assist this State to improve and better manage its water courses, we need to ensure the EPA has adequate resources. That is not just staff but also powers of enforcement. I got the impression from the EPA that its big concern was that if this legislation went any further than what is currently being proposed by the Government, it would be overwhelmed. That is not a reason not to go beyond this legislation but it is a reason to ensure we not only amend the thresholds and the other technical aspects of the Bill but also give the Environmental Protection Agency the resourcing and powers it needs to do a very simple job, namely, to properly protect and promote the quality of our water so that communities, businesses, nature and our ecosystems are properly protected and improved. This Bill does not do that. We will not be opposing this Bill but we will right tooth and nail in the 45 minutes the Government has given us to try to improve it. The Minister of State should rest assured that this issue will come back to the Oireachtas in the future. It may be after this Government is gone and another Government is in its place but this battle is not over and it will continue until we get this right.
#PatriciaRyan	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-party	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-dob	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	254	The purpose of this Bill is to create a registration and licensing system for the abstraction of water from the water table.This is yet another EU directive that the Government has been slow to implement. The Government has been very fast in trying to saddle the people with water charges to suit its privatisation agenda but slow in addressing water quality and supply issues. The Bill is a legal requirement of the water framework directive and is many years overdue. Many other jurisdictions, including the North of Ireland and Scotland, have had similar water abstraction arrangements for many years. Deputy Ó Broin has referred to this. There must be proper management of the water system. Having a registration and licensing system for water abstraction is a good start. This Bill will modernise the regime for water abstraction, which is outdated and limited in scope. The current scheme is based on legislation enacted in 1942 and 1964.  The Bill will provide a pretty simple registration system for water abstraction, subject to a minimum threshold under which registration is not required. The EPA will administer a licensing regime for water abstraction over a specified threshold. Uisce Éireann, as the national authority for water services, will have the power to abstract subject to EPA licensing and to appeal to An Bord Pleanála regarding possible impacts on third-party water rights. Emergency powers will be available to Uisce Éireann to abstract, where required, due to drought. The Bill provides for compensation for material adverse effects caused by interference with water rights as a result of public abstraction. I am wary of going into too much detail given the time allowed. This important Bill runs to 114 pages and the digest alone runs to 22 pages. The Sustainable Water Network report runs to 231 pages. The Oireachtas housing committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report unanimously agreed that the thresholds proposed by the Government should be raised to bring them into line with those in the North of Ireland. The committee made 13 recommendations in total and the Sustainable Water Network has called for their implementation in full.  The thresholds for both registration and licensing are too low. During pre-legislative scrutiny, the committee heard evidence on thresholds currently operating in the North and Scotland. Sinn Féin tabled amendments in the Seanad to give effect to the committee report recommendations but they were rejected by the Government.  We must ensure that all abstractions of 10 cu. m per day or more are required to be on the register of abstractions. All abstractions of 20 cu. m per day or more should have to apply for an abstraction licence. The Minister of State must recognise the need to ensure species and habitats are protected under the habitats directive and birds directive. Over-abstraction can cause springs to dry up and wells to empty. It can also cause subsidence and reduced river flow. Poor management of the water system can have significant health, environmental and biodiversity implications. Poor management of the water system can also have a negative impact on water supply and quality, particularly near large water extractors, including data centres and drinks manufacturers. Sinn Féin has argued that the provision in the Bill that no existing abstractor can be refused a licence should be removed. We need to go further to prevent further environmental damage. The EPA must be properly resourced to run the registration and licensing regime. It is vital to have an adequate inspection and enforcement regime to underpin the regulations. As the Minister of State knows, where I come from is pretty near the border with his county. We call Monasterevin the Venice of Ireland. We must give specific recognition and protection to canals and navigable waters there.
#RuairiOmurchu	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-party	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-dob	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	255	I appreciate that. I was unaware of the Venice of Ireland. Every day is a school day. My party position has already been laid out fairly clearly. People will probably say I should just sit down and say nothing, making everyone a lot happier, but unfortunately I have an inability to do so. Deputy Ó Broin, who I suppose has made an assertion of sorts, referred to the logic for the licensing and registration thresholds and the point made that the EPA would not be fit for purpose, would come under far too much pressure and would be unable to do the job that is necessary if it were to do exactly what is done in the North. That point does not make a lot of sense. The fact is that we support the general notion of what needs to be done and all accept that we need to know by how much we are reducing the water table. That goes without saying. We are in a very changed world because of climate change and know about the huge impact on biodiversity. A considerable number of those who might have believed there was no need to worry about climate change have changed their minds based on the weather forecasts over recent years. We have come under severe pressure owing to water supply. We have seen very low levels in lakes, rivers and reservoirs. My town, Dundalk, has had issues. Like everywhere else, it is dealing with an increased level of manganese. There is considerable research on why there is such an increase. I am told it sometimes exists at the bottom of water sources and features when the water is churned up. This happens easier when dealing with lower water levels. I will return to this. The legislation proposes a two-tier regime. We all accept that but just cannot accept the registration threshold of 25 cu. m and the licensing threshold of 2,000 cu. m. We need these to be 10 cu. m and 250 cu. m, respectively. It is hardly a shock for Sinn Féin to be proposing something on an all-Ireland basis but the fact that there has been good practice on this island and in other places gives me no reason to believe we could not follow what is happening elsewhere. If there is a problem with the EPA regarding resources, we are leaving ourselves wide open to a considerable number of issues if we do not address it. We need to make sure it is absolutely fit for purpose. The Minister of State welcomed the work done by the committee and the report, but, as Deputy Ó Broin stated, many of its proposals have not been implemented. It makes absolute sense to do so. Ultimately, we all know the EPA needs to be resourced if it is to be responsible for managing the system. It does not make any sense for us to have rules if we do not have enforcement capacity. Therefore, the latter needs to happen. We are back to having the conversation we always have at Christmas about rushing legislation. Only 45 minutes has been allowed to deal with a large number of issues of incredible importance in ensuring we have a fit-for-purpose water abstraction system and can deliver healthy water sustainably and with the steady supply that is necessary. We have all spoken about the changed water supply circumstances owing of climate change. What I propose is necessary. I will return to the local issue. The people of Dundalk have been dealing with absolutely brown water for the past several years. Nobody believes what they hear from Irish Water on flushing. I have met representatives of Irish Water in the past while on the manganese issue. Manganese reacts with chlorine and can lead to brown water, which is not particularly appetising. Irish Water is attempting to put a process in place in Cavanhill that will remove the manganese from the water. It has not had much success and reckons that by the end of quarter 1 of next year, in or around March, it will know the solution. However, it could take upwards of two years to deliver a solution that would ensure the water of Dundalk looks like it should, along with being reasonably healthy.That needs to be done. To return to the Bill, sufficient time must be provided to allow due diligence to be done. We must put something in play that is fit for purpose because that is not we have at the minute. It is not good enough.
#CianOCallaghan	unknown-#CianOCallaghan-party	unknown-#CianOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#CianOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	256	The way the Government is handling this legislation confuses me as it is unclear to me what it has absolute contempt for. Is it absolute contempt for the legislative process, democracy and the idea of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas committee and scrutiny by the Dáil? Is it absolute contempt for the environment, water and biodiversity? Is it absolute contempt for compliance with EU directives on the environment? In which of those three aspects does the Government have no interest whatsoever, or is it all of them? It is absolutely incredible. In 1996, the European Commission pointed to the need to establish procedures for the regulation of the abstraction of fresh water. The water framework directive was adopted on 23 October 2000. Since 2007, the Commission has been engaging with Ireland on what it considers to be Ireland's incorrect transposition of the water framework directive. It has taken more than two decades for the State to come up with this legislation, and 45 minutes is the amount of time to be given to consider it on Committee Stage. How on earth can anyone in the Government say that this is a serious way to treat the issues of water abstraction, the environment and biodiversity? The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, cannot tell me that after two decades all the Government could give this legislation was 45 minutes. As Deputy Ó Broin said, a very good pre-legislative scrutiny report was done on this legislation. A lot of work went into that report two years ago. Of the 13 key recommendations in the report, the Oireachtas briefing indicates that only two have been implemented. The advice given to the committee by the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers two years ago was very strong and clear that the general scheme of the Bill did not meet the needs of the water framework directive. This issue is very important. It has a huge impact on our local communities, the local environment and biodiversity. The impacts of water abstraction in the context of the water table and climate will only intensify over the years to come. Research by Maynooth University indicates that by the 2050s, there will be summer reductions of between 20% and 28% in precipitation on our southern and eastern coasts. This will increase to between 30% and 40% by 2080. What happens with water then? How abstraction is regulated and licensed is incredibly important. Lower groundwater levels can have serious consequences and can pose a particular risk to wetlands and biodiversity. In my local community, it was a pleasure to see the recent restoration of a wetland. Very good work was done by volunteers and Fingal County Council, through the Howth special area amenity order, about ten years ago. An area known as the Bog of the Frogs, which was without a bog and did not have any frogs for years, now has the wetland restored. That is a very important local habitat but this is important throughout the country. That project was in a very localised area but it is important that we value these habitats throughout the country. During pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, many concerns were raised that the approach was seriously flawed. The OPLA flagged key concerns, including around the proposals to set thresholds for water abstraction far above the levels set in other countries. The OPLA identified six major areas of concern in the draft legislation of non-compliance with EU directives. On the licensing and the thresholds being set, I am concerned by the comments given by the Minister for State that one of the reasons is the administrative burden a lower threshold in licensing would place on the Environmental Protection Agency. Others have rightly made the point that we should have best practice and should do the same as in the North and countries around us with similar water conditions. We should not have thresholds set at a level simply to suit the EPA and its current capabilities. The agency needs to be resourced properly to do the job to ensure we have the best possible protection, in line with best practice in neighbouring countries. During the pre-legislative scrutiny, the Sustainable Water Network outlined its very serious concerns about the breaches of the habitats and environmental impact assessment directives, as well as the water framework directive. Given these serious concerns flagged during the pre-legislative scrutiny, including by the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, it is not unreasonable to expect that the unanimous recommendations made by the all-party committee would be implemented. It is gravely concerning that most of them are not being implemented. It is also gravely concerning that the threshold of registration is to be set at the level proposed. It should be lowered, as the pre-legislative scrutiny report recommended, to 10 cu. m in line with Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. The licensing threshold should be reduced from 2,000 cu. m to levels similar to those in place in Northern Ireland, England and Wales, as the report recommended. Having Ireland as an outlier, in the context of our neighbouring countries, is very concerning. The majority of abstractions would not be subject to controls because the threshold for licences is set far too high. To put the threshold on the licensing into context, 2,000 cu. m would be enough water to supply a town the size of Nenagh or other mid-sized towns. Towns and urban populations smaller than that will not fall into this licensing requirement and threshold. If we consider this in terms of daily water intakes and abstractions, these are very considerable water extractions that will not fall into the licensing arrangements. That is not acceptable. I have not heard from the Minister of State the basis for this or the rationale behind this. He told us there was a scientific basis for that threshold. I ask that it be shared with us as a matter of urgency in advance of Committee Stage of the Bill on Wednesday. We need to see the data for that in good time to enable us to get people with expertise to examine them. With regard to the EU water framework directive, Article 11.3(e) clearly states that member states can only exempt from these controls, abstractions or impoundments which have no significant impact on water status. In setting the threshold that high, it is very hard to understand how anybody would think abstractions at a level that would supply smaller towns and towns the size of Nenagh would not have a serious impact on water status. It is hard to see how the Government believes this is not a clear breach of the EU water framework directive. Why does the Government believe we can set levels that are very different from the levels set in surrounding countries? What is the basis for that? It was pointed out during pre-legislative scrutiny that the EPA risk assessments are based on incomplete data. The analysis of the data published by the EPA showed that the EPA's database was wholly incomplete. Yet again, we are seeing a minimalist approach being taken to try to avoid EU sanctions.Instead of trying to do our best to protect our environment and biodiversity, and instead of trying to implement the directives in the spirit in which they are intended, this is yet another attempt, becoming all too familiar, to do the absolute minimum in the hope that that will avoid sanctions and might just get us through in respect of compliance with the directives, rather than realising that the directives are there for a good reason and for our benefit. They are not simply something in respect of which we try to do the minimum in order to avoid sanctions. It is in our interest to manage our water and the status and supply of it in the context of our biodiversity and our well-being. That is critical. I wish to go through some specific issues that are outstanding from the pre-legislative scrutiny and that the Government has not addressed since then. The way in which the thresholds have been set is clearly contrary to the EU environmental impact assessment directive because it is arbitrary, based as it is purely on size. It is not consistent with Article 11.3 of the water framework directive, which presupposes an assessment of all abstractions. The legal issues with not assessing anything under 25 cu. m remain outstanding in this iteration of the Bill. The indefinite licences allowed for in the Bill are not consistent with the requirements of the water framework directive. Article 11.3(e) of that directive expressly provides for controls in respect of abstractions to be periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated. I do not see how the Bill squares with that. Article 11.3(e) of the directive states, "These controls shall be periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated." There is no provision for that in the Bill in respect of these indefinite licences. Section 52 provides for a review but it is not mandatory and is undertaken only in certain circumstances, either on request of the licence holder or if the agency believes there is a risk. As for EIAs and compliance with EIA and retrospective EIA definitions, section 2 of the Bill provides for EIAs, but the description of EIAs in section 14 does not include any reference to cumulative impacts, a fundamental and crucial part of the EIA and particularly important in respect of abstractions, where a multitude of small abstractions could pose a significant problem. Paragraph 5(e) of Annexe IV to the EIA directive is very clear on this in the context of cumulative effects. Its non-inclusion in the Bill is a clear inconsistency with the provisions of the directive. As for retrospective EIAs, there is again a clear omission here. The abstractions Bill does not include a determination as to whether carrying out a retrospective EIA would circumvent the purposes and objectives of the EIA directive or the habitats directive as the planning code does. Likewise, reference to remediation is entirely absent from the exceptionality test in the Bill. That is very concerning. Any such assessment of the potential to remedy any past damage is absent from the Bill. Why is that so? The points that I am raising and that other Deputies have raised emphasise the complexities of the Bill in respect of compliance with EU directives, but somehow the Government thinks 45 minutes will do justice to this. That is utterly impossible. I implore the Green Party Members, who I know are interested in our biodiversity, water, climate and groundwater and abstractions, to ensure, considering that it has taken two decades for this Bill to progress, that the Government provides proper time for this to be discussed. Forty-five minutes on Committee Stage cannot possibly do it. At no point in the whole Bill is appropriate assessment or a Natura impact statement mentioned. The Bill provides that the EPA may require, for the purpose of determining a licence application, the carrying out of an EIA but not an appropriate assessment. That omission is repeated throughout the Bill. There is no explicit obligation on the agency to carry out an appropriate assessment at any point. It is critical to highlight that although there are frequent references in the Bill to protected areas, those sites are limited to those habitats and species that are directly water-dependent and entered into a specific EPA register. That does not equate to protecting all European sites designated under the habitats directive. I do not think I need to remind the Minister of State that these directives are not optional; we must comply with them. There are all these questions, omissions and holes in the Bill in respect of important European directives with which we must be fully compliant. It is both our legal obligation and utterly in our interest that we do this properly. As for retrospective Natura impact statements, the Government cannot be seen to incentivise circumvention of EU directives. We know that from the Derrybrien case and the case law in that regard. As such, it is imperative that remedial Natura impact statements are required in addition to a retrospective EIA. The Bill falls extremely short in regard to provisions relating to the right of the public to participation. Specifically, the agency is required to assess abstractions and to make important determinations on them in sections 17 and 18, with no provision for public consultation. The Aarhus Convention, the EIA directive and the habitats directive all provide for public participation. It is clearly the case that sections 17 and 18 of the Bill relate to environmental decision-making, which falls under the auspices of the Aarhus Convention and, as such, requires provisions for public participation. Why, then, is that missing from the Bill? We will not find out the answers to these questions in the mere 45 minutes of Committee Stage debate the Government seems to think fit to allow for this. No abstractions for hydroelectricity would have to undergo an EIA, as outlined in the Bill, but there is no provision for appropriate assessment. While certain projects can be exempt from an EIA and the planning code, that is not the case for appropriate assessment. There are no blanket exemptions from that at all. Finally, I wish to give examples of unlawful practices we have seen in respect of special areas of conservation and their habitats. While it is very important we do everything we can in respect of our energy security, there are always ways to ensure we do proper legal diligence while allowing projects to go ahead for social and economic reasons if they are needed for energy security. I reiterate that there is a lot of detail in the Bill that requires proper scrutiny, examination, debate and consideration. We did that at the Oireachtas committee two years ago in the form of pre-legislative scrutiny. We spent a lot of time on that, brought in many witnesses with a lot of expertise and did a very good report. That seemed to sit on a shelf for two years. The Government has not followed through on the directive, which was brought in 22 years ago, in legislative terms until now. After all that time and all the effort the Oireachtas committee put into the pre-legislative scrutiny report, it makes no sense now to shoehorn the end process - the consideration of amendments, which is one of the most important parts of the legislative process - into 45 minutes. That cannot be done in any proper way at all. I therefore implore the Government to give more time to this. I have no issue with the Dáil sitting as long as it takes before the recess to do that. If the Government will not agree to that, it should bring this back straight after the recess, in January, because this is very important legislation, in order that it can be given the time it needs on Committee Stage.As a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Heritage and Local Government, I would have no issue with giving it as much time as is necessary on Committee Stage and I doubt other members would either. We could do that in a week or so to consider these amendments and issues in detail in order to do this Bill justice as this country and our environment deserve.
#StevenMatthews	unknown-#StevenMatthews-party	unknown-#StevenMatthews-dob	unknown-#StevenMatthews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	257	I find myself in agreement with Opposition speakers here today. We worked together on the relevant Oireachtas committee. As has been said by others, we heard from a number of witnesses who advised us and we put together a report with a number of recommendations. The most important piece of information the committee received was legal advice from the OPLA on a number of questions we raised. I am unsure as to whether we did or can share this legal advice with the Department but I think it is extremely important that the Department considers the questions raised in that legal advice. I will go through them in more detail. The first thing I will discuss is the issue of thresholds. I think the thresholds are wrong. One of our Senators put down an amendment that would have ensured the threshold would have been reduced from 25 cu. m to 10 cu. m. That amendment was ruled out of order as it would place a cost on the State or the people. I cannot remember the difference between them. I understand why that requirement is there and why the Bills Office may rule, and I ask for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's judgment on this as well, but I do not understand. Everything administrative places some level of cost on somebody. What was being proposed would have been of far greater benefit to the people and the State than what is being proposed in the Bill. I ask the Minister of State to consider that because if I put down the same amendment, it will get the same ruling here and it would be a waste of time. I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider introducing the 10 cu. m limit for registration. I do not do this to place an onus or unnecessary regulations or rules on people who are abstracting less than 25 cu. m. I ask for it to assist us in managing our water quality, abstraction rates, flow rates, ground water and lakes and in order that we would have a comprehensive register. One of the reasons we are trying to do this is because we do not have such a register. Much of the registration is kept in local authorities and is not centrally located and that is what we would be able to do through this Bill. In order to be able to manage something, you need to have the numbers. You need to know what is going on. I would imagine that anybody who is abstracting water would want to protect that water source. In cases where we have low flow, low ground water or low lake levels, I think anybody abstracting from those sources would like to play his or her part in trying to manage and ensure we do not over-abstract. Having a 10 cu. m threshold and having registration is not about putting rules and anything more difficult on people who are abstracting; it is about making sure we can communicate that we know where those locations are and can manage our water resources. I do not think anybody abstracting that water would mind doing that. Regarding the cost on the State or the people, when the EPA and Irish Water, which are the two bodies tasked with this, appeared before the committee, they said that registering is not an onerous process. It is quite an easy process to register so we are not talking about some difficult and hugely administrative burden involved in trying to register these 10 cu. m. I imagine that others will put in that same amendment and we would have good reason to do so because it is similar to what we see in other jurisdictions such as Scotland and Wales. They have a similar hydrological cycle and similar geology, so there is no reason we should go for 25 cu. m when they go for 10 cu. m. I hope the Minister of State can bring that forward on Committee Stage because then it would not be subject to being ruled out of order, which would probably be the case if I or others brought it forward. In terms of the lawfulness of that threshold, as I remember the legal advice, the 25 cu. m was an arbitrary figure, may not stand up to scrutiny and may not be compliant with the water framework directive. The reason we are trying to do this is because it is incredibly important that we manage our water. Over the past two years, we have had many discussions on water, Irish Water, water quality and water supplies. We were held to account in Europe because we failed to have a proper abstraction management system or register in place. What I feel we may be doing here is trying to comply with that European ruling and putting in place a system so we can go back and say we are now compliant with that infringement order. I am not sure what the correct terminology for it is. However, what we will be putting in place will eventually be found to be non-compliant with the water framework directive so it will be an infringement similar to that but just on another basis. My concern is that we are just pushing something down the road. We are better than that. I think all of us in here want to protect our water quality and environment. The advice from the OPLA is quite clear. Often when you read legal advice, it can be quite complex and difficult to understand. The advice we were given was really clear so I hope the Minister of State takes that into account, considers it and sees what can be done. I note that we got quite some detail on water abstraction during pre-legislative scrutiny. We were told that 4% of rivers, 9% of lakes and 8% of ground water bodies are at risk due to abstractions. They appear to be small figures but our hydrological cycle is changing. We are going to have periods of drought, high rainfall and flooding and those figures may change. It would be wise for us to put in place a system that recognises that if we are not aware where all these abstraction points are, we cannot manage them properly. Water is one of those vital and finite resources where failure to manage it affects health, our country and every single person in this country, not just the people who abstract. It affects our economy and can have a massive detrimental impact on our country in general. I hope the Minister of State takes these points into consideration for the next Stages.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	258	It is really hard to think of anything that is as necessary to life as water. Next to food and heat, it is truly essential. When the previous Government attempted to bring in water charges, we were constantly told by various business interests that water would be the new oil in the coming years as the environment globally became threatened by the climate crisis and other crises. When Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and Fine Gael tried to ram through water charges, they were quick to tell us how precious a resource water is. That was their main justification in pushing water charges on ordinary people. While the name of this Bill might seem abstract, it could hardly deal with anything more fundamental and basic to life. Like a lot of Bills that come before us, the rationale is good. The need for some regulation of water taken from our rivers and lakes is self-evident and we know the national picture in terms of water quality is grim, that EPA reports on our rivers and lakes are regular desperate warnings about the state of our waters and the biodiversity they support, and that nitrogen is choking our coast and rivers. Any Bill that seeks to regulate and protect our water systems is welcome. However, I am again struck by a paradox when it comes to how the State regulates any and every sphere. We are told this Bill will give effect to several EU directives. Essentially we have to legislate. As we often do, we are choosing with this Bill the path of least resistance - minimal regulation and the bare essentials required to get us over the Brussels line. When you look at this Bill and read over the very useful Seanad debates on it, a few questions jump out and it would be good if the Minister of State could clarify matters. As was highlighted in the Seanad debate, the threshold for registration is 25 cu. m while the threshold for licensing is 2,000 cu. m. I am at a loss to understand why anything below such large volumes of water is exempt from regulation. It is at odds with the regulations in the EU and the UK and even within the North of this country. The threshold has been estimated to be the same as the amount of water required to supply 42 households. The Seanad debate heard that of the 21 water-bottling plants in the country, none would pass that threshold. How does that make any sense? I know that the Minister of State has been asked this question multiple times, but has the Government resolved the conflict between this Bill and the advice of the OPLA in relation to the thresholds on the volume of water can be taken before there is a need to hold a licence or even to be registered to do so? The OPLA has suggested that it is inconsistent with the EU directive, and that the EPA would find it impossible to assess whether there is any determination of the status of water bodies if the threshold is below 25 cu. m. Why are we enforcing different standards between existing licence holders or extractors and new licence holders? Why does the legislation contain such large categories of exemptions? We know that the likes of Diageo and Glanbia take significant amounts of water from our water bodies, but I am unclear on whether this legislation essentially gives them a free pass again. That needs to be clarified. If it does, the Minister of State might explain the logic behind regulating to protect our water bodies but ignoring vast sections of industry that are placing a demand on them. I want to talk about data centres. Will this Bill regulate the use of our water by data centres? We know they require massive amounts of water as well as energy. While we wait to see if the lights will go out this winter because of our insane policy of supporting the unbridled proliferation of data centre building, the other side of that coin is the significant use of water at those centres. Despite the greenwashing associated with them, they are a massive draw on our water supplies and our water bodies, yet we seem to be largely ignorant about how much and what water is being used. According to figures gathered by The Business Post, the average data centre uses about 500,000 l of water per day at the lower estimate. It is reported that this figure has the potential to rise to 5 million l per day. The Facebook data centre in County Meath used 395 million l of water in 2019, and that site is currently being significantly expanded. One data centre in Dublin filed planning applications that suggested it could use up to 4.5 million l of water a day. Of Amazon's large network of data centres in Dublin, permission sought for a centre in Dublin 17 stated that it could use 296,000 l of water a day, a facility on the Belgard Road could use approximately 320,000 l of water a day, and one in Blanchardstown could use 330,000 l a day, according to The Business Post. When I asked Irish Water about data centre water use, its replies suggested that it does not know what the level of usage is, and that it does not think it is that important to monitor the volume and quantity of water used. Officially, it reported to me, when asked, that while the overall percentage consumption of water may be low, at 0.13%, it is 810 million l for 24 centres, or an average of 33.75 million l per centre each day. That may baffle people, but there are very obvious problems with the answer. The figures supplied relate to water use for 24 data centres, but we know that there are more than 70 data centres in this State. Irish Water has given no convincing explanation with regard to the other 50 or so data centres. Worse, it does not seem to have an issue with the proliferation of data centres, or even a guess at what might happen when the next dozen or so hyperscale data centres are built and come on stream. That is extraordinary, and stands in stark conflict with the attitude to domestic and household use by ordinary people. What is even more alarming is the full answer from Irish Water, which states:Data Centres are one type of non-domestic customer and we don’t analyse them uniquely in planning for future demand as they would represent a very small percentage of current and future non-domestic use. Data Centres mainly use water only for staff facilities and cleaning; some data centres do use water for cooling purposes, but based on the Irish Climate, that would be for a short number of days per year.Perhaps someone should tell Irish Water about climate change and the impact of global warming on this country. It seems the State bodies responsible for this and those responsible for regulation have little interest in knowing how much and where our water is used by industry. Again, we are forced to regulate. We still seem keen to go ahead with light-touch or no-touch regulation. I am afraid this Bill is another example of such regulation. I would appreciate the Minister of State attempting to answer the questions that have been posed.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	259	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this most important legislation. Listening to the debate, I think there is a fairly clear message that not enough time is being provided to consider this important Bill. A 45-minute session on Committee Stage next week is not good enough. On the topic at hand, we are talking about the extraction of water and how we manage and regulate that. We are discussing how we ensure we do not end up with a crisis every so often if there is a drought or a flood. I am sure Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows all about the extraction of water from Lough Corrib in Luimnagh, the amount of water we take from the lake, and the extent of the population served by that water. It serves people from Tuam to Oranmore and right across the area. I find that we are putting a huge amount of effort into purifying the water, but at the other end of it, we are actually polluting the water first. We have come to a stage in Ireland where we have to decide whether we are going to be serious about how we regulate and how we implement policies. For example, we have a hit-and-miss approach to how sewage is processed in this country. Scattered around County Galway, there is a proliferation of private wastewater treatment plants and housing estates that have been left by builders and developers, who have sold the houses. The residents are left to maintain these systems, to pay for everything that goes wrong with them and to pay for the power that runs them, etc. I believe this is an environmental time bomb that is about to explode on us. Some of these treatment plants are located near our watercourses. In Corofin, there are six such private plants on the edge of the River Clare, which feeds into Lough Corrib. We can talk about levels and everything else, but we must talk about the quality in what we are doing. As Irish Water refuses to take charge of these plants, we are relying on the taxpayer, who has paid a fair penny for his or her house, to actually try to take care of them. It is not going to work into the future. It is not sustainable. We can talk all we like about the issue, but if we look at areas such as Gort in south Galway, we see complicated watercourses, underground courses and so many things going on there. It has taken four or five years to try to understand how flooding occurs, how it rises and falls and where it comes up. All of the swallow holes and sink holes have to be studied. Hopefully, we will not see a serious flood in the area before the drainage scheme is completed there. The Government is bringing in a Bill that talks about the levels of extraction, the quality of water and registration for extraction. It plans to ram it through in a very short period of time. The legislation is fraught with risk because it will be challenged. We will have a situation where we will not know what is happening until we test it. Deputy Matthews, who is a Government Deputy, has raised a red flag on behalf of the Joint Committee of Housing, Local Government and Heritage by highlighting that the OPLA's advice has not been taken into account. He is asking for a bit of sanity with this Bill. There seems to be a rush of blood to the head. It seems as if we want to take the EU regulations we are supposed to put in place, tick the box and say, "Here they are". I do not agree with some of the stuff in the Bill. I think it might be over-regulated. Somebody else might agree that there should be more regulations. At this stage, however, there is too much at stake for our water quality and water supply to try to shoehorn this through the Dáil in the last couple of days coming up to Christmas. It is too serious for that. It is wrong for the people of Ireland that we would do something like that. It is time to call a halt and try to get to grips to see exactly what it means to put in all these regulations. We see what happens with planning and all the layers of bureaucracy we build in when we are doing these kinds of things. They slow down the whole process. We cannot deliver houses, health infrastructure and much of the stuff we need in this country. We must also bear in mind that we have a growing population and we must provide for them into the future. We must provide for a quality of water that can be safe. If we go back, however, we are polluting the water first and then trying to clean it. Let us forget about the levels for a minute. The town of Craughwell on the outskirts of Galway, for example, is a growth centre for the city and it does not have a municipal wastewater treatment plant yet. Corrofin, Abbeyknockmoy and other places do not have municipal treatment plants. In every one of these places, we have rivers that are flowing and contributing to our water source to feed the water back out. We have got the thing backside over. We need to start off and say let us clean up our act and clean up the water and second, make sure whatever we do is workable and that we actually end up with the right result and we are not just satisfying an EU piece of legislation. I could go on all day but I will leave it at that. Much more time is needed for this Bill, however.

#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	261	I am very concerned about the rushed nature of the Bill. It is important legislation but it is being rushed through. I also have serious concerns about the fact there has not been enough engagement or collaboration with the farming organisations, which have a number of concerns regarding the Bill. That also concerns me because it should be about listening to what everybody has to say to ensure we get the legislation as right as it can be and that it is robust and fair. I call on the Minister of State to have further engagement with the farming organisations in the State on this issue. We are all agreed on the need for a system of controls to protect our environment and implement measures to control the abstraction of freshwater and groundwater and the impoundment of fresh surface water. As the Minister of State will be aware, however, there are serious concerns about certain provisions and sections of the Bill, which have been raised by farming organisations such as the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, in recent times. There are issues relating to compensation and the perception that the Bill grants excessive powers to the Minister, particularly with respect to the definition of "licensing threshold" and "registration threshold". The IFA said this, in particular, creates massive levels of uncertainty for farmers and it needs it addressed urgently. That is why I am asking the Minister of State and Government, which is supposed to represent rural Ireland, to please spend more time engaging with the farming organisations, which have legitimate concerns. They know what they are talking about and know the facts and implications of bad legislation. My colleague, Senator Boyhan, moved a number of amendments in the Seanad recently seeking to have these deficiencies addressed. In total, the Senator moved nine different amendments. Unfortunately, these were not accepted, which means the concerns farmers have remain. It is it is disappointing that rural Senators from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have turned their backs on farmers and on the farming organisations in respect of the amendments that my Independent colleague tabled. The IFA is also seeking challenges to the exemptions in Part 3 relating to the water abstraction necessary for animal welfare purposes. Senator Boyhan also referred to this in the Seanad debate on the Bill last week. He made it clear that the IFA requested that this exemption be included because besides water availability, the quality of water has a direct impact on the welfare of animals because livestock need to drink more water under heat stress than when forage conditions are poor. Overall, the IFA believes we need to do more to ensure the animal welfare aspect can be protected in order that we can provide the highest quality produce to Irish customers and to our trading partners. This is the rationale, which I hope the Minister of State will accept. In the wider sense, there is also the perception that farmers are somehow not doing their fair share or playing their part when it comes to protecting freshwater supply and surface and groundwater. I have repeatedly made clear my own dissatisfaction with the whole narrative and, indeed, with the EPA in that regard. The EPA is pointing the finger and almost putting the blame entirely on farmers, which is not the truth. Indeed, in the latest Focus on Local Authority Environmental Enforcement Performance Report, the EPA calls for increased inspections and greater enforcement of environmental regulations on farms. However, this is despite the fact that last year's quality report from the European Commission demonstrated clear signs of water quality improvement in Ireland. As I understand from research by the IFA, the report shows improvements in 152 of the 726 water bodies that were prioritised areas for action in the water framework directive, River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018 - 2021. In that context, the constant attacks and criticism farmers receive from the likes of the EPA amounts to demonisation and can only add to the perception of farm families as environmental laggards when nothing could be further from the truth. I am aware that the EPA placed County Offaly among the five lowest performing local authorities along with counties Mayo, Sligo, Wexford and Waterford when it comes to enforcement and inspections. I am also aware, however, that farmers in County Offaly move heaven and earth to ensure they nourish the land they cherish, which provides their families with a living, as increasingly difficult as that is. I am sick and tired of agencies like the EPA pouring out this toxic and incorrect perception of farmers when it comes to environmental ambition. Where is the sense of proportion, balance or fact? As I said, the EPA is now asking for increased inspections and higher levels of enforcement, as if farmers were routinely engaged in bad environmental practices and were just getting away with it because of a lax regime. Nothing could be further from the truth. Farmers are the most highly regulated people of any profession. Indeed, the regulatory burden of the new CAP programme makes that explicit. Farmers will gladly work with a regulatory system that is fair and proportional and that takes their genuine needs into account.They cannot operate within a system that does not reflect the experience of operating a farm where the water extraction needs that inevitably arise are not catered for in a prudent and responsible manner.  It would serve the EPA better to look at where Irish Water as a regulatory body is falling down in terms of poor sewerage infrastructure, which is causing problems, is a problem in my constituency and is regularly reported to Irish Water. There are housing developments with significant ongoing issues. It would serve that agency better to look at that, instead of demonising farming families. 
#RichardODonoghue	unknown-#RichardODonoghue-party	unknown-#RichardODonoghue-dob	unknown-#RichardODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	262	This Bill is being rushed through. I have no doubt but that it will go through the House and proceed to Committee Stage, where there will be amendments. Deputy Nolan said and I repeat that Independent Senator Boyhan put down nine amendments, all of which were ruled out of order. The Government is not listening to the people on the ground who know what they are talking about. It is estimated that approximately a massive 45% of treated water is lost nationally due to leakages. Can the Minister of State imagine that? I wonder how many of the leakages are in Dublin. If they fixed the water leaks there, they would not have to look for water to be piped from the Shannon to Dublin at a cost to taxpayers. When the Bill was introduced today, reference was made to scientific evidence. Recently in Limerick, people in the Adare-Rathkeale district were put under a flood plain. These levels are taken from Malin Head. That is where they work their bases off for their scientific evidence. They put businesses and households under a flood plain. The people and businesses had to get an independent investigation and evaluation done to find out the OPW and EPA mapping was inadequate. It has not been updated in years, yet the Government is bringing a Bill into this House to get it passed when it has no current data on scientific evidence. It cost the householder in Limerick €1,100 plus VAT to get his review, which he has to give to the local authority to bring his house out of a flood plan it is not in. That is because information is inadequate. This Bill should be looked at more and more done on it before it is brought through the House. The Government is imposing hardship on people around the country, putting them into flood plains with inadequate information and making them pay to get back out of them because of the lack of information the Government has. This is hitting farmers, householders and SMEs, who are paying again for the inadequate scientific information the Government holds. Why is the Government trying to rush this Bill through with the wrong information? If someone goes for planning permission for a house, they ask the applicant to check if their house is on a flood plain. They tell you it is and you check it and find it is not. Committee Stage is the only chance. We will be voted down if it goes to a vote. The only chance we have is getting it to Committee Stage, where we can table amendments and bring it back before the House for debate.  We are talking about the local authorities and Irish Water and it has been proven by the OPW's own surveys that the biggest polluter in the country is the local authorities, which have been crying out for funding for years to upgrade sewerage and water systems and have received promises from governments going back 32 years in Askeaton. They are still waiting for funding but the Government is allowing raw sewage to go into rivers. Then it wants to bring in an extraction Bill to bring out of the sea by extraction what it has put into it in the first place, namely, raw sewage. Then it wants to treat it. I was with somebody yesterday who came up from my parish in Granagh. It was a young girl of 14 years and her mother. We sat down outside and had a cup of tea. They observed to me that common sense is not that common within the Government. That came from a family living outside of Dublin. Like myself, they live in the rural area of Granagh. We want common sense when it comes to this Bill. This Bill needs amendments. It needs to be debated properly and not rushed through the Dáil. Listen to the people on the ground, the farmers and the SMEs. Government Members have based the Bill on scientific information that is out of date. We have been told by the OPW that it could take up to three or four years to upgrade the CFRAM maps that are out of date. Yet Government Members are making rules and regulations which are imposed on people who have to go away and pay money to show that the information is wrong.  The EPA has confirmed that 211,000 boil water notices were issued in Ireland in 2021 on tap water that was not safe to drink. However, on 7 October 2022, the EPA released a report showing the quality of drinking water in public supply remains high, with over 99.7% compliance with bacterial and chemical limits. Is that scientific evidence as well? I implore that the amendments that are tabled on Committee Stage by the people who understand it are listened to. If Government Members want to bring a Bill through the House with scientific information, will they try to make sure that information is current and not outdated by three or four years? They say climate changes on a weekly basis yet they are making rules based on something three or four years out of date. They should have done surveys first and brought their scientific information up to date. They are out of date, out of touch with reality when it comes to people tabling amendments to the Bill and out of touch with the farming and SME sectors. I implore the Minister of State to accept amendments to the Bill so we can try to get the Bill right and not impose hardship of farmers, SMEs householders and people of this country who have to live and who understand the network that is there. 
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	263	This is a very big piece of legislation and there is an awful lot of detail in it. I agree with what has been said by, I think, every Member so far, that this is too rushed. That is what the Government uses December and July for. They seem to be the only months it can do legislation in. It rushes it through here so there is no discussion and debate on it. That is obviously what the Government wants. There are 12 months in the year and we sit for 11 of those months.There is plenty time for debating legislation. However, the Government insists on using July and December to rush legislation through and to make sure that no debate can take place on it. Next week, 45 minutes will be dedicated to the Committee Stage debate on the Bill. The Bill contains 120 or 130 sections. Allocating 45 minutes for the Committee Stage debate is an insult. The Minister of State would be better off taking all Stages today and getting it over with, rather than trying to pretend that the Government is allowing a debate to take place on the Bill. That would be fairer to everybody because it would mean that Opposition Deputies would not be forced to draft and table amendments, only for them to all be rubbished anyway. That is the reality of how the Government looks at the legislative process and how things go on in this House. I fully agree with all the Deputies who have said that in respect of the debate on this Bill. I looked at the Minister of State's contribution in the Seanad, as well as that made by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, earlier. They were both shocking. This is the level of Government we have. The Minister of State said: “The provisions of the water framework directive have not been transposed into Irish law and the Bill is a significant milestone in Ireland's overall environmental protection measures.” The Minister of State proceeded to say: “Unfortunately [I do not know why he put the word “unfortunately” in there] the absence of a comprehensive and modern abstraction-management and control regime in Ireland has led the European Union to open infringement proceedings against Ireland for failure to fully transpose the directive.” What a surprise. How many Bills are taken in this House, particularly in the months of July and December, funnily enough, that have been put in place on the foot of European infringement proceedings? Such Bills are rushed through the House because we have to meet these deadlines. The water framework directive came in - correct me if I am wrong - in 2007, or 15 years ago. It has taken that long to get to this point. The Government has not bothered to do anything to comply with that directive. Much has been said about how Europe is bad and is forcing us to do this. It is the Government’s own inaction that is forcing us to do this. Even today, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, said that the “Enactment of the Bill will form a considerable part of Ireland’s response to these proceedings”. The Government is not even going to resolve these proceedings. It will just make it look like as if it is doing something 15 years later to comply with the regulations that have been forced on it. That is sad. It makes a mockery of the democratic process and of this House and its Members. This is the way the Government operates. The Government has done as I have outlined. Obviously, every Government since year dot has done the same thing. It is not anything particular about the current Government. Maybe members of the Government will try to blame the so-called permanent government for it. The permanent government is guilty of it too, because it does not prepare the legislation and does not give it to the Minister of State to rubber-stamp and put through until situations like this arise. That is shocking. However, it is the situation we deal with and live with it in this House. That is how things are done, which, I suppose, is fair enough. That is the way that things will go on. It is my own fault that I have only been looking at this Bill over the past couple of days. I am not a member of the environment committee, so I do not always see the Bills coming through. I commend the members of the committee on the amount of work they have done in the process of scrutinising this legislation, which is important. A number of Deputies referred to the registration threshold requirement of 25 cu. m per day. I note what the Minister of State said about how many people this captures and stuff like that. I tend to agree with the Minister of State, and maybe we could flag it up that I do, that 25 cu. m is probably adequate in terms of a registration process. As previous speakers indicated, it is out of line with the situation that obtains in the North, Scotland and Wales. There may be an argument to bring it into line. It is not a huge amount for registration but it would impact on farmers that have lower registration levels. I do not think that they are the big culprits as far as water abstraction is concerned. What I think is much more worrying - although they have to register because they are above the abstraction limit - is the limit of the 2,000 cu. m for licensing thresholds. That is much more worrying. In particular, as was outlined by Deputy Bríd Smith, 21 water-bottling plants are under that threshold. That is shocking. How could any reasonable person look at this and say it is acceptable? This relates to the big bottled water manufacturers who abstract massive amounts of water and who will be let go scot-free. They will not have any licensing procedures or thresholds imposed on them. That is completely wrong. It does not make any sense at all. It probably does make sense for Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil Deputies because their point of view is that these are businesspeople and they are businesses that we have to look after and protect. By doing it that way, they are certainly going a long way to ensure that these businesses will be protected. That is completely wrong, and it needs to be addressed through the legislation. The other part of this Bill that struck me as I was looking through it is the exemption for certain abstractions. Section 9(3)(h) states: “such other abstraction or activity relating to an abstraction as the Minister may prescribe.” This relates to whatever the Minister thinks. He will see what to do, and that is what he will do. That is completely wrong because there should at least be some process whereby the Minister of State can put this forward to ensure that it is scrutinised and done properly. To provide for anything the Minister may prescribe is not the way to go about a registration process in the context of the Bill. It is completely wrong. There are other aspects of the Bill that I have concerns about. Committee Stage will be taken next week, for all of 45 minutes, and the deadline for the submission of amendments is tomorrow. I will table amendments and I will see them being rubbished by the Minister of State on the day. Within that 45-minute period, one amendment will probably be debated. I will leave it at that. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle

#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	266	The Water Environment (Abstractions and Associated Impoundments) Bill 2022 is a significant milestone in Ireland’s overall environmental protection measures. The critical Bill sets out a system of controls on the abstraction and impoundment of water to protect our water environment and to ensure compliance with Ireland’s responsibilities under the water framework directive. This forms part of Ireland’s response to the European Commission infringement proceedings in the field of water policy. The process of drafting the Bill has involved extensive consultation with a range of stakeholders including the EPA, Irish Water, ESB and Waterways Ireland, among others. The system provided for under the Bill modernises the process whereby Irish Water can carry out a public extraction to supply water. It provides legal certainty in a number of key areas including the means by which objections may be made to proposed Irish Water abstractions, compensation for material adverse effects and water rights as a result of abstraction by Irish Water, temporary and emergency abstraction by Irish Water, the protection of canals and navigable waters and abstraction from ESB reservoirs. The Bill modernises the regime of water abstractions which is outdated and is limited in scope being based on legislation that was enacted in 1942 and in 1964. It provides for a simple registration system for water abstractions, subject to a minimum threshold where registration is not required.It provides a licensing regime administered by the EPA for water abstractions over a specified threshold. It provides updated power for Irish Water, as the national authority for water services, to take abstractions subject to EPA licensing and subject to an appeal to An Bord Pleanála in relation to possible impacts on third parties' water rights. It provides for compensation for material adverse effects caused by interference with water rights as a result of a public abstraction by Irish Water. It makes specific provision to allow Irish Water to abstract water from ESB reservoirs with the agreement of the ESB. It gives specific recognition and protection for canals and other navigable waters under the control of Waterways Ireland. It recognises the roles of the ESB and Waterways Ireland. It gives necessary environmental protections to our water sources. I thank all Members for their contributions to the debate this afternoon and I commend the Bill to the House.

Carlow library has tremendous and ambitious plans, plans that are hugely curtailed because of funding. Carlow library is housed in Carlow's old Presentation school building. The regeneration project which is in the capital four stage approved process received stage three approval in August 2022, having met and adequately responded to all the Department of Rural and Community Development's queries and recommendations. The project is now shovel-ready and stage four of the approval process is construction and subject to funding. The project is ready to go to tender. As usual, the reason I am raising this matter is to find out where we are at with that funding. My understanding is that there has been a commitment that they will receive the funding. The Presentation school building houses the main branch library, county archives and the county museum, Carlow tourist office, the county heritage services and, when finished, will also host the county council's arts service. The building is in every sense a cultural and learning hub for the community. The Presentation school buildings are at the centre of the public realm in Carlow town and represents the main linkage from Tullow Street to the cultural quarter, which includes Carlow Cathedral, Carlow College and VISUAL. It is in all senses at the heart of the county capital. With two third level institutions, including the new South East Technological University, of which we are very proud, we are delighted to say that we now have thousands of students coming to Carlow. A quality public library with adequate study facilities, technological infrastructure and space to house the library collections is essential.To meet the requirements of the upcoming new national library strategy, Carlow will require a state-of-the-art facility to adequately deliver on its recommendations. The case is that the existing library footprint is no longer adequate for the population it services. It is way too small. The project's overall size of the new library and archive services is about 1,000 m2. It is not really accessible. The most recent quantity surveyor's report costed the project at €12.1 million with €1.7 billion allocated to protect the existing building. I urge the Minister of State to consider these points and support Carlow's bid for a new extension to the library building. What is the status of this project with the Department of Rural and Community Development? I know many libraries have been built around the country. I understand that one is nearly ready to open and the nearest neighbouring town, Portlaoise. It has made considerable progress. We in Carlow are ready to go. Because Carlow is now honoured to be a university town, we need the library. We need new facilities because we need to ensure that we look after the people who want to use it. At the moment it is way too small is not really suitable for our needs.

I am taking this question on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys. While the provision of library services, including the provision of buildings, is primarily a matter for local authorities in their capacity as library authorities under the Local Government Act 2001, the Department of Rural and Community Development has overall policy responsibility for the provision of public library services in Ireland and is responsible for the development of public library strategies. Additionally, that Department provides grant funding to library authorities on an annual basis including funding towards the costs of new and refurbished libraries, under the libraries capital programme. Carlow County Council submitted an application to the Department in August 2020 for funding for the redevelopment of the Presentation buildings to include a new public library, culture, civic and learning space. The Department's libraries capital programme was fully allocated at that time and Carlow County Council was advised to consider making an application for funding under the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, which is administered by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Carlow County Council was also requested to simultaneously progress the project through the Department of Rural and Community Development's four-stage capital management process. This is standard practice for all new library projects, irrespective of their source funding and including URDF-funded library projects, to ensure that they are technically assessed and comply with the public spending code and the capital works management framework as well as meeting the current benchmarks and standards for public libraries. The Department of Rural and Community Development has been liaising with Carlow County Council in progressing the Presentation building regeneration project through the four-stage capital management process. The Department issued a stage 3 approval letter on 17 August 2022 that authorises the council to proceed to tender. The letter also advised the council to ensure that funding had been confirmed for the project in advance of proceeding to tender. The Department has been engaging with the council, but it is a matter for the council to source the funding. Unfortunately, it is not possible at this stage to make any commitment on the next library capital programme. We do not have confirmation of the direction of travel on that programme quite yet, but we hope to have it soon.

It is unacceptable. We were told to approach the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage under the URDF which I did. At meetings with that Department's officials, I was told that this project does not fall under their Department. This is passing the buck from one Department to another and is unacceptable. Carlow County Council needs a commitment for this particular building. The fact that no one knows where the money is coming from is a major issue. I can only express my absolute disappointment today with the Minister of State's answer. For months and months, I have been told to go to the Department of Rural and Community Development and then the other Department. Today I am none the wiser as to which Department has responsibility for the library. I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on several occasions and have been told it is not his Department. I ask the Minister of State to confirm to me in writing the funding structure and which Department the library falls under.

Responsibility for the capital works for libraries does not necessarily fall under one particular Department. As I said earlier, local authorities are the primary body with responsibility for them. The libraries capital programme was fully allocated when Carlow County Council applied. The current programme concludes this year and preparatory works will shortly commence on a successor programme for the following five-year period. There is a decision to be made on that and I cannot share with the Deputy much more information than I have been given on that. We will prepare another capital programme. I believe the referral to the URDF was made in good faith but, understandably, the URDF has refocused its work on housing.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	271	I apologise for being late; I was at a Zoom meeting. I thank the Minister of State for his patience. Life is hard enough for children with disabilities. Families with children who have disabilities are already creaking under the pressure. As the Minister of State will know, waiting lists for children are growing at an unprecedented rate. More than 18,000 children are now on the waiting list for initial contact with the children's disability network team, CDNT. According to the latest data available up to the end of September, 18,473 children are on these waiting lists, an increase of more than 1,000 from the end of May. That is a shocking increase of 6% in only four months. If this trend continues, waiting this could rise by more than 15% in a year which is an enormous toll to put on any children with a disability and their families. These waiting lists are longest in Dublin in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 9 and CHO 7. In CHO 9, I understand 2,295 children have been waiting for more than a year for initial contact with the disability network team. In CHO 7, 1,323 children have been waiting more than 12 months for their initial contact. In total, 2,991 children are on this waiting list in CHO 9 which covers north Dublin and a devastating 77% of those children have been waiting more than a year for contact with their team. That is simply not acceptable and I know the Minister of State will not try to defend it. He knows as well as I do that that is unacceptable and must change. There must be an invention. By comparison in CHO 7, 2,456 children are waiting for contact, meaning that 54% of children have been waiting for more than a year in CHO 7. That sounds good in comparison to CHO 9, but it is not. It is devastating for the children and their families that they are waiting for so long. The CDNTs are supposed to help families and children navigate their way through the health system but it does not seem to be working in many cases I know of a young lad Seán who has autism. He is from Ringsend and was going to school outside the area in Blackrock. He ended up having to go to a primary healthcare clinic for dental work.The confusion and lack of services for him was just ridiculous. It should not matter where a child goes to school. He is only going to school in Blackrock because there is not a school locally for him and for children with his disability. There are very long waiting times and there is a very significant problem in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4 and CHO 8, which cover the midlands, Cork and Kerry. Half or more of the children on the lists in these counties are waiting more than a year. Will the Minister of State give these families and these children any hope or light at the end of the tunnel?
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	272	I thank Deputy Andrews for raising this important issue. The Government is fully committed to the development and enhancement of children's disability services through the implementation of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People or PDS programme. I fully acknowledge this change programme has been challenging for many stakeholders, in particular, for children and young people using the service as well as for their families. These challenges have resulted in unacceptably long delays for families to access much-needed therapies for their children. The Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities would like me to take this opportunity to reiterate on her behalf her sincerest apologies to any family experiencing such delays. Prior to the introduction of the PDS programme, children in different parts of the country with the same needs got varying levels of service based on geography rather than need. This was clearly unfair and needed to change. The core principle of PDS is to achieve fairer and more equitable access to services for all children with disabilities based on their needs and not where they happen to live. As the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities has said in this House, the reconfiguration of children's disability network teams, CDNTs, by the HSE has faced challenges, particularly relating to the recruitment and retention of staff. There is currently an average vacancy rate of 28% across the 91 CDNTs, which equates to approximately 524 vacancies out of a total allocation of 1,892 whole time equivalent staff. Notwithstanding these challenges, it is important to acknowledge the significant work involved in establishing the CDNTs and the services that are being delivered. Approximately 35,000 children are currently receiving services and supports provided by these teams. Having said that, we must acknowledge there are waiting lists and there is much more work to do. In this regard, funding has been provided to the HSE for additional posts in recent years to strengthen the capacity of children's disability network teams to ensure services can be provided. This funding provides for in excess of 600 additional whole time equivalent posts for children's teams. It is evident the vacancies in the teams are not due to a lack of resources but due to the scarcities that exist in the health and social care sector for specialist therapy professionals. I assure the House that the HSE continues to pursue a range of options to enhance the recruitment and retention of essential staff across all aspects of the health services, such as targeted national and international recruitment for CDNTs, the inclusion of an agreed relocation allowance where appropriate, the provision of both apprentice and sponsorship programmes for therapy grades, the employment of graduates as therapy assistants as they await CORU registration, and the expansion of therapy assistants in the system with the HSE supporting individuals to return to education to qualify as therapists. I trust this clarifies the issue raised by the Deputy about Seán in Ringsend who suffers from autism, and I will bring the Deputy's views back to the Minister of State as soon as possible.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	273	I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to children with disabilities. There is no questioning that because she put in a great amount of work. She is very committed and is trying and working very hard to unpick or disentangle the mess that applies to her brief. This is not about lack of will from the Minister of State. The Government very much needs to step up to the plate and to invest in resources. The measures mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, need to be fast-tracked to ensure the vacancies are filled. Some 20% of all posts are vacant. That equates to 450,000 lost therapy hours a year. That is massive for families who are struggling to manage, support and care for their children. The figures and data I outlined earlier relate to waiting lists for initial contact. We do not have data for those waiting for other appointments because of ICT deficits. That is something we must strongly challenge. As the Minister of State knows himself, families are struggling and life for children with autism and various disabilities is very difficult. When they go to particular schools, often they are bussed out to their school because there is not a local school for children with autism. This is something in which we, as a society, have failed. We have failed children with autism and we must stand up for children with disabilities and with autism.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	274	I thank the Deputy again for his contribution and concern in this very important matter. I assure the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will continue to engage with the HSE to fill the vacant posts and to drive them towards the levels required. Most of the disciplines working in the CDNTs are similar to those working in other areas of the health and social care sector, both public and private. In this context, the HSE disability services continue to experience ongoing challenges in recruiting and retaining staff across all the disciplines and grades on their children's network teams. A comprehensive PDS national team development programme has been provided for network managers and has been circulated to all team members. This programme, which was designed to support the establishment of the new CDNTs and to support implementation of the new model of service, will also support staff retention. Both the HSE and the Department acknowledge that while many children with disabilities and their families are accessing services, too many families are reporting an unsatisfactory experience. Some families are experiencing long waiting lists and others report varying degrees of consistency in the services they are receiving. We understand and recognise the distress this causes and I can assure the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will continue to work tirelessly with the HSE to find long-term solutions to the staffing issues which, when improved, will ensure children and young people with complex needs will be able to access the services that are vital for their development. The Deputy has mentioned fast-tracking the services and I restate I will bring his views back to the Minister of State. I thank Deputy Andrews again, however, for raising this very important matter. I also agree with him that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is doing everything she can to address this very difficult situation.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	275	This question is to discuss the employment-related issues concerning community employment, CE, schemes supervisors and assistant supervisors. There is an issue around pensions also and there are a range of issues which have cropped up over the years that have never been fully addressed. One of the main ones is that most CE supervisors' jobs are benchmarked in the wrong way and it is not a proper recognition of the qualifications that are required, the activities they are forced to undertake and the job specification. I have a copy of the job specification here, which I believe it is slightly out of date. Very few job specifications, however, would have so many parts of it outlined with such specific requirements. I am surprised, therefore, that they manage to get anybody through the process of becoming a supervisor on that basis because they are expected to do so much. That may perhaps be because the CE supervisor is a role which captures quite a good deal, given the CE programme itself does so much. I am not criticising the scheme; that is a debate for another day. There is the need to repurpose it and, in some ways, to get the Department of Social Protection separated from it, because there is too much concentration on job progression and not on community support.However, as I said, that is a different debate. Today's debate is about the supervisors themselves and the fact that they have had very limited, if any, increases in pay. They are dependent on the Government to set the rates of pay and to issue the funding through the Department of Social Protection to the sponsor organisation. Basically, the Government or the Department is the shadow employer, but we cannot negotiate with a shadow employer, as we would do otherwise. That is why the supervisors rely on me and sometimes the unions to go into the Labour Court. The problem is that they should not have to do that. There should be some type of negotiations to look after supervisors, some of whom are 20 years in the job, who are at the highest point of the increment scale. The scale has only four points and then a person is stuck, which makes supervisors feel devalued. An additional focus and workload is put on them. Those who are coming in at that level are now required to have a Bachelor of Arts degree or level 7 equivalent. Unlike in the past, there is no recognition of a change from a level 6 to level 7. There was not an increase in pay or recognition for that. Neither was there an increase for the additional work in terms of the bureaucratic work that is now associated with the job, albeit on computers. However, in the past supervisors did not have to fill out as many forms by hand. A range of issues is associated with the fact that the job of a community employment supervisor is not permanent. If the number of participants in a scheme drops, which has happened in places around the country, it means the job of a supervisor can be endangered and there is no guarantee that he or she would be employed on an adjacent scheme, which could also be going through the same problem, or that there would be some other work available and the person will then be back on the scrapheap looking for another position as a supervisor or for something else.
#JoeOBrien	unknown-#JoeOBrien-party	unknown-#JoeOBrien-dob	unknown-#JoeOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	276	I acknowledge the work done by the more than 840 community employment schemes nationwide. CE provides vital services to local communities in areas such as the delivery of meals to older people, assisting in childcare provision and environmental work and in keeping towns and villages across the country maintained and looking well. There are more than 20,000 places available on CE, with a budget of more than €375 million in 2022 and 1,230 people are employed by schemes as supervisors and assistant supervisors. The Department of Social Protection funds CE through the provision of grant funding to sponsor organisations that run schemes. The Department is not the employer of supervisors; they are employees of individual sponsor organisations. I am, of course, aware of ongoing employment-related issues for CE workers. The first relates to an ex gratia payment to CE supervisors on their retirement. I am pleased to say this issue has been resolved, with a settlement reached with unions. The first group of ex gratia applications are with the Department. These relate to persons who retired since 2008. In total, 630 completed applications have been received. The processing of payments is under way in respect of these claims, with payments starting to issue from this week. I expect all of the first batch to be issued before Christmas. In relation to pay rates for CE workers, the Department, as the funder of CE schemes, received correspondence earlier this year from Fórsa and SIPTU seeking a pay increase. Fórsa and SIPTU referred this pay claim to the conciliation service of the Workplace Relations Commission. The WRC has issued an invitation to the Department to take part in a conciliation process. Any increase in pay rates that could potentially increase the overall cost to the State of funding schemes must take into consideration the potential cost to the Exchequer. The Department has been in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue, given the potential cost and the knock-on effect it would have on the increased grant funding required to run schemes. Both the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I fully agree that there must be a process in place to deal with this pay claim. I am aware that the WRC process was used in the past to look at pay claims in the State-funded community and voluntary sector. However, the Department can only participate in this process on the strict understanding that this is in its role as funder of the schemes. We are of the view that the WRC conciliation process could be very useful in identifying a solution to this specific issue.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	277	It is quite clear that the State is trying to hide behind the shadow-employer aspect of the role it plays in the WRC process. The State sets the payscales and benchmarks. No CE scheme is allowed to set the pay scale for a supervisor. Any scheme that increases the funding for a supervisor is punished, as the Department of Social Protection reduces the materials grant available for the scheme. Given the job of a supervisor, it is vital that this job and the job of an assistant supervisor is benchmarked in a different way; one they deserve. Anybody around the country who has enjoyed the services of those who work in CE schemes will attest to that. Supervisors act as counsellors, psychologists, confidantes, trainers, mentors, managers and administrators. The role is a significant one. There was no recognition of it, but during Covid, meals-on-wheels services continued to operate. The drugs project that I am involved in, Liberty Recycling, empties clothing banks around the country. The participants on the CE scheme were in attendance and were looked after all through Covid. There was no additional recognition for that work. As the Minister of State mentioned, every community benefits from the schemes. The only people who do not seem to benefit from a greater recognition of their role in servicing our communities are supervisors and assistant supervisors. We must be real on this and look at benchmarking them against a higher grade than clerical officers within the Civil Service. My suggestion is to benchmark them against training workshop managers or equivalent because, in many cases, supervisors deal with people who have a lot of issues and they must try to help them back to employment or to complete their years of employment while supporting the community.

It is a difficult job. We are not hiding behind a shadow-employer status. I am very much upfront in saying that the Department of Social Protection is the main funder of CE schemes and, accordingly, we need to respond to the claims of supervisors. In recent weeks and months, I have been very much trying to move things along. I am hopeful that we will make significant progress in the coming weeks. As I stated earlier today in the Chamber in response to a similar question, we need the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to back us now. As a Department, we are willing to go in to the WRC and to make an offer, but we cannot do that without the sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I very much want to do that. We will keep pushing. We must look after CE supervisors and assistant supervisors, who do amazing work and we should reward them for it.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	279	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, for taking this Topical Issue. My question relates to the availability of school places in north Kildare. As the Minister of State is aware, north Kildare is in the heart of the commuter belt and has a growing population. As always, there are growing pains. This is not new, but it does remind me of the early noughties when we had this situation before in 2005. Some 20 years later, I had hoped it would not recur, but unfortunately it has. If I look around my constituency, I will start with Naas Community College, where I was chair of the board for the past five years, where the principal, Ciarán Keegan, does his level best to accommodate as many students as he can, but he has to turn people away. In Maynooth there are two new buildings, Maynooth Post-Primary School and Maynooth Community College, which were both built on the Moyglare Road in recent years. The project involves two brand-new schools side by side.Their construction is possibly the largest investment in education at second level that the State has ever made. They only opened a couple of years ago, yet they are already oversubscribed. A new school is awaited in Prosperous. It has not opened yet but it is due to be constructed. Three schools are coming together in Celbridge, which is a project that I have championed. There have been multiple school investments around the constituency, which I welcome. However, my concern is that, even with these projects, we will still be far behind the supply of school places we need. My office and I have been inundated in recent weeks with parents crying out for help and saying they cannot get places in Naas, Maynooth, Kilcock or Clane and asking me about what can be done to help them. One of the actions I hope we can take is to plan ahead. Will the Minister of State advise on what the forward planning unit in the Department of Education is doing in this regard? Many parents have contacted me. The town of Clane, for example, has one secondary school and a couple of primary schools, with a few more in the hinterland. Thankfully, there has not been an issue to date. This year, though, there were 330 applications for the 210 places available, meaning that 120 people were left waiting. This came as a shock to parents because they had never experienced it before, but it should not have come as a shock to the Department of Education, which has access to primary school numbers, Central Statistics Office, CSO, census figures and other demographic metrics. As a result, I would have expected the Department to have been in a position to acknowledge, anticipate and respond to demand. I have mentioned two brand new schools in Maynooth. Enrolment for first year in Maynooth Post-Primary School is 170 students and enrolment in Maynooth Community College, which is located next door, is 170, totalling 340 places. However, there are still 80 children waiting per school, totalling 160 at least. I do not have the exact figures for Naas, but Naas Community College, Naas CBS, St. Mary's College, Gael-Choláiste Chill Dara and Piper's Hill College are heavily oversubscribed. This is not a new situation for Naas, having lasted for several years. I get calls at this time every year about a lack of places, with parents saying that their children are way down the list in 120th, 150th or 180th place. When children are put on a list, they are sometimes subscribed to multiple schools and lists thin out as it gets closer to September, but parents suffer considerable anxiety while waiting to see whether the lists are oversubscribed or whether there are duplicate applicants. As information comes out, students or families make up their minds and choose places or the schools choose them, but this does not always happen and, unfortunately, some pupils are left behind. That is no comfort to those waiting anxiously at this time every year, though. The problem is predictable. Kilcock has the same issue. Scoil Dara still has a waiting list of 77 students after the second round offers were made and the schools attempted to whittle down the number. I have given a cross-section of entirely predictable issues in Clane, Naas, Kilcock, Maynooth, Leixlip and Celbridge. There are large growth plans for all of these areas. We need to build houses and expand the population's accommodation, which the Government is doing through Housing for All, but we must keep pace. We were in this situation before in the 2000s, so it is disappointing that we are in it again now. I hope that the Government has a plan to address it. I thank the Minister of State and look forward to his response.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	280	I am taking this Topical Issue debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, who is otherwise engaged. I thank Deputy Lawless for raising this matter. As he pointed out, the population of Kildare, and north Kildare in particular, has been growing for a number of years. He has been a strong advocate for the provision of services for the increasing population, be those commuter services, schools or additional Garda stations. He is working on all of these because they are having to catch up with the growing population. I acknowledge his consistent work in this regard. On the matter of post-primary school places in north Kildare from September 2023 onwards, the Deputy will be aware of most of the issues affecting his constituency of Kildare North from his close involvement with schools' boards of management. For school planning purposes, the Department of Education divides the country into 314 planning areas and uses a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and residential development activity, is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040's population and housing targets inform the Department's projections of school place requirements. Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, the Department makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand. Where data indicate that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through one or a combination of the following: utilising existing unused capacity; extending the capacity of schools; and the provision of new schools. The Department's projections of post-primary school place requirements in north Kildare show an anticipated continued growth in enrolments in the short to medium term. It is important to note that, where enrolment pressures arise, it could be as a result of a variety of factors. Sometimes, it is down to population increases. It is important that local authorities are kept in touch with regarding housing developments that are likely to occur in the area. Where a school has a particular reputation, it can draw pupils from outside its area. Single-sex schools might not be suitable for some pupils. In other cases, parents went to a school and want to keep the connection. While I would not overemphasise it, some parents in areas with growing populations have their children's names down for a number of schools. While that would have to be verified, it can be an element, albeit a small one. The Department is working to establish the true extent of capacity issues across school planning areas through its discussions with the relevant school patrons and authorities. This close engagement will allow the Department to identify at an early stage particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years and how best to deal with those. A number of projects are under way in north Kildare or were completed recently: Maynooth Post-Primary School and Maynooth Community College; Confey College; Coláiste Chiaráin in Leixlip; Naas Community College; Coláiste Naomh Mhuire in Naas; Salesian College in Celbridge; Celbridge Community School; St. Farnan's Post-Primary School; Scoil Mhuire in Prosperous; Scoil Dara in Kilcock; and Enfield Community College. I would be happy to give further information to the Deputy on these projects.

Laois in his own constituency is experiencing similar growing pains, which the Minister of State advocates on regularly. I am aware of the projects the Minister of State mentioned and there has been investment in a number of schools in north Kildare. If these were all new projects about to come on line, I would look forward to a future with them open, but many of them are already up and running. Maynooth Post-Primary School and Maynooth Community College have been open for a couple of years. Naas Community College is open. I attended its opening with the Minister, Deputy Foley, only a few months ago. Enfield Community School is also open. Despite these schools being up and running, we still do not have enough places. That is my concern. The Minister of State is an intermediary in this, but I ask that he call on the Department of Education to take up this matter and that its forward planning section contact schools proactively and use the data the Minister of State outlined to us - Project 2040, CSO data and primary school admissions data. There is a role for principals - many of them do this work already - to engage collaboratively with one another. The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 provides for that level of engagement so that principals can cross-check application lists and whittle down overlaps. More remains to be done. The system must be streamlined and made more efficient. In the case of Maynooth, it has been put to me - the suggestion makes sense - that there should be a common patron, given that there are two schools on the same campus. I do not blame the principals, both of whom I know. Mr. Johnny Nevin and Ms Siobhán McCauley are doing their best. At some level, though, perhaps communication is not working or the lists are not being refined. We can see the same happening in Clane. The principals in Naas meet regularly, but the process needs work. Perhaps the Department is the missing piece of the jigsaw. I will conclude with Councillor Daragh Fitzpatrick, a friend and colleague who is chair of the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board. Regarding Maynooth, he recently stated that there were 14 categories for ranking applicants but that the schools were already full after the first category.What is the point of having 14 criteria if you cannot get to the second round because there is no more space after the first category? That is the building that I said was the biggest school project of its type in the State ever. I stress that we need those additional places. We need clarity from the Department on when and how they will be provided and we need some comfort that it will go ahead for 2023, 2024, 2025 and beyond. I would be very concerned if it was not the case.

I believe Deputy Lawless fully understands the position. As I mentioned earlier, the Department uses 314 planning areas around the country to plan for the future development of schools. The planning areas in Kildare North are Maynooth, Kilcock, Leixlip, Celbridge and Prosperous. I will make a practical suggestion to the Deputy. Years ago, when I was a newer Deputy in County Laois, there were 11 schools in Portlaoise, all with competing demands. I eventually got every one of their principals and board of management chairs to a meeting in the county hall where we had representatives of the Department to try to do it on a proper basis rather than each school competing with each other. It was a way by which we ended up with great results. I suggest that the Deputy identify the particular schools in the areas that I just mentioned and try to put a mechanism in place where the principal and the chair of the boards of management of the four, five or six schools can come together and work collectively. It would make it easier for the Department were there a joint effort coming forward. It might be an unusual way to do business but it is probably the Irish way of doing business by getting people in around the room and rather than each of us competing with each other and everyone ringing the Deputy to say that their classroom, ASD unit or school extension has priority. We know what happens then. He should bring the local authority into that meeting too because it is doing the county development plan and knows what is being planned in the area. As it will have details on commencement notices for new houses too, the local authority could be helpful in that process. I acknowledge Deputy Lawless for raising this as he has done with so many issues in Kildare North, which is an area of growing population. All I would say to him is to keep the pressure on.

I thank the Minister for being here to take the Bill. I appreciate his having given me a commitment in October on the floor of the House on the need for year-round water quality monitoring. That is something I have sought for a long time. I will start by acknowledging his commitment to that and asking if we might have a timeline for when that might be brought in. I welcome our visitors in the Gallery who are here from a number of groups and who are activists on the issue of water quality and environment in Dublin Bay, particularly those from the SOS Dublin Bay group. I will speak a little more later on the work done by that group. I want to acknowledge the great interest in and support for the issue of the environment of Dublin Bay and the protection of the environment that I have experienced since I first started raising this issue. I raised it first in summer 2021 when I was running in the Dublin Bay South by-election. It was something that had become increasingly apparent to me during Covid and the lockdowns, starting in 2020 when I and many others around the country began to gain a greater appreciation of the need to enhance the environment around our coastlines and in our sea water. Many of us took up sea swimming and while I know it has become a bit of a cliché with the dryrobe-wearing sea swimmers, I plead guilty to being one of those. Jesting aside, Covid gave us a huge and renewed appreciation of the need to put in place proper structures and frameworks for preservation of our natural environment generally and particular our coastline, bay areas, swimming areas and seas. As an island nation, this should have been apparent to us a lot longer ago but perhaps we had disregarded it or neglected it as an issue.  It was in that vein that I first put together a Bill to ensure that that sort of statutory framework would be put in place for the preservation and enhancement of Dublin Bay. We drafted a Dublin Bay Bill. I was thrilled and honoured to be elected to represent Dublin Bay South in July 2021 and after that we worked on the Bill. It is almost exactly 12 months ago, on 7 December 2021, I introduced the Bill in the Dáil on First Stage and then it went into the lottery. This is my first lottery Bill and I was delighted when it was pulled out of the hat to have the opportunity to put it forward today on Second Stage. I hope that the Government will not oppose it. I see the Minister is shaking his head and I thank him. It is positive to hear that he will enable it to proceed because it is a Bill that should get cross-party support from Government and Opposition alike, because it enshrines such an important principle. If passed, it would promote a radical new vision for the protection and enhancement of the wonderful natural amenity on our doorstep that is Dublin Bay. It would establish a statutory Dublin Bay authority charged with preserving the distinctive character of Dublin Bay and protecting its ecology as a coastal resource. In particular, it would improve the amenity of the bay for sea swimmers, sailors, walkers along the shoreline and all of those who want to use the bay area. We look to establish an authority with its mandate to propose and promote policies and priorities for the protection and enhancement of the environment of Dublin Bay and of the natural habitats and wildlife in and around the bay; to co-ordinate, promote and support strategic planning and sustainable development in and around Dublin Bay; to make recommendations to regulate and control pollution in and around the bay; to promote public interest in and respect for Dublin Bay as a public amenity; and to co-ordinate the activities of public bodies and other organisations and persons in matters connected with the performance of its functions. Crucially, membership of the authority will come from elected members of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly and others with a special expertise or interest in the future protection of the bay. That co-ordination and that democratic accountability is what we see as hugely important in the establishment of this statutory authority. We are conscious that there is already a non-statutory task force that has a similar role but which has no teeth because it is a non-statutory entity. Over the last year or so in particular, I have become very conscious of the very significant role that Dublin Port plays in the planning and development of the Dublin Bay area. The difficulty there is that Dublin Port should be just one of the stakeholders charged with a role in deciding on the future of Dublin Bay. It should not be the only one and there should be democratic accountability in the authority that has this role in ensuring the preservation of the environment of Dublin Bay. While environmental protection of Dublin Bay will be a priority for the new authority, it will also have a mandate to improve access and facilities around Dublin Bay and to improve public amenities in the area. The authority would have the aim of creating a better framework for environmental protection, governance and improvement specifically of water quality for all those who use the bay. The idea is that through the creation of this authority, we would have a strengthened framework for the protection of one of our great resources. It is a great resource not only for those of us in Dublin Bay South but all across Dublin. I know that Deputy Ó Ríordáin, representing Dublin Bay North, has as strong an interest in this as I do and, indeed, as any of us who represent coastal constituencies do. All of us in Dublin have strong connections to the body of water stretching from Howth to Sorrento Point. We have strong connections to the bay. It is the first thing we see when we fly in if we are on an aeroplane flying home or if we are in a ship coming in from abroad. It welcomes us. It is where many of us learn to swim, sail or paddle and, of course, it is the location of the opening chapter of the great Dublin novel Ulysses. All of us have this strong connection.  I return to the support I have received and the network of organisations that are supportive of this Bill. I am very proud to have worked with a large number of people and organisations on this Bill. In this regard, I give particular credit to our local councillors in Dublin Bay South, Mr. Dermot Lacey, Ms Mary Freehill and Mr. Kevin Donoghue. Councillor Lacey, in particular, has been calling for a co-ordinated statutory authority to take over the governance of Dublin Bay for a long time. I have also worked with the group SOS Dublin Bay, an important local group with a considerable number of supporters that launched some time ago a petition called SOS – Save Our Sea in Dublin Bay. The petition now has more than 20,000 signatures, which again shows the strength of feeling on this issue. The group was formed arising from concerns about water quality in the bay area. I have also worked with swimmers from the Half Moon Club in Poolbeg. A large group of us swim very regularly off the South Wall. We had a new ladder put up by Dublin Port recently. We call ourselves the Half Moon Mad Yokes, a somewhat ironic name. Swimming is hugely important for people's physical and mental health. I have also had great support from the local residents' group SAMRA, the Sandymount and Merrion Residents Association, which has been really supportive from the very start. I held a public meeting in Sandymount on 13 September. I was staggered to see how many people came along. They included councillors from Dublin Bay South, Labour Party councillors from Dún Laoghaire and many people with no party affiliation, including local residents and those from further afield, who simply wanted to see a structure put in place for the preservation and improvement of the Dublin Bay area. To return to the existing structure, or lack thereof, the informal task force currently has no statutory powers. There is, therefore, a lack of co-ordination with regard to the protection and enhancement of the wonderful amenity that is Dublin Bay. Nowhere is this more evident than in the crumbling dereliction of the old Sandymount and Blackrock baths, which anybody who goes up and down the coast will be familiar with. There is such a severe lack of facilities for those who want to use the sea or bay in a more meaningful manner, including those who want to swim but who lack really good facilities. We see good facilities in other countries. In Barcelona, for example, the port has been greatly improved as a public amenity. We see the lidos in London and all sorts of other examples of where much better facilities have been provided and much better use has been made of a city coastline. We should have a lido with public access at George's Dock for all swimmers. That is the sort of initiative that a new authority with statutory powers could deliver. There is an example elsewhere of this sort of statutory model. On the east coast of the United States, a statutory task force was established some years ago for Chesapeake Bay to preserve it, improve its water quality standards and encourage its greater use as a public amenity. The deterioration and pollution of Chesapeake Bay in the 1980s caused local public leaders to come together to form this task force. That focus saw significant increases in federal funding to preserve the bay and resulted in very much improved water standards and more responsible use of the bay for local communities. That is the sort of community facility we want to see established in and around Dublin Bay. We have some great examples of enhancements. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, for example, enhanced the Dún Laoghaire baths, which are due to open next week. The Clontarf coastal bicycle route has greatly improved facilities but there is no co-ordination, nor is there a structural statutory framework to co-ordinate the preservation and enhancement of the bay area. That is why we are calling on colleagues from all parties in the Government to support this Bill.  My colleague Deputy Ó Ríordáin will speak further about why we need to see this legislation put in place.

As a fellow baywatcher, I believe this legislation is particularly important for the area I represent, Dublin Bay North. One of the communities in my constituency is grieving today as a result of the laying to rest of a four-year-old girl this morning. I wanted to acknowledge that on the floor of the House today. All of us here will do whatever we can to provide support to the family in what are absolutely heartbreaking circumstances for them and the school community, which happens to be in my constituency. To return to the Bill, we feel strongly about Dublin and believe it deserves protection and enhancement. We feel strongly that lessons have to be learned from the various crises we have had over the years. People returned to the bay at the time of the financial crisis. When people had struggles in their lives, they began to reconnect with what was on their doorstep. They returned to the bay during the Covid crisis, when people may have been locked out of other pursuits. They turned to the bay to walk, swim and enjoy the absolutely fantastic facility of their doorstep. Then they began to realise that it may not be tended to, treated or enhanced as well as it should. At my part of the bay, Doldrum Bay, Howth, raw sewage is pumped in. That has been of major local concern in the Howth area for several years. In Clontarf, one can see the conditions in which the swimmers swim. Clontarf is an iconic part of Dublin. All the iconography and paintings associated with Clontarf are about swimming and the associated sense of enjoyment, yet the facilities are just not up to scratch. You do not have to go to Spain to see enhanced facilities; you can go to Portmarnock, in the Minister's constituency, to see how things can be done – in this case by Fingal County Council. We must not have a mismatch of authorities, from Fingal County Council to Dublin City Council and others, overseeing this incredible facility. Therefore, the Labour Party is suggesting that we need to have a structure over Dublin Bay that will protect and enhance it. In this regard, let me repeat what Deputy Bacik said. We suggest a new statutory Dublin Bay authority. This is not a new idea. As Deputy Bacik has said, it has been advocated for many years by people from many different backgrounds and interest groups. The new authority would be tasked with the promotion of policies for the protection and enhancement of the environment of Dublin Bay and the natural habitats and wildlife in and around it. I can think of how this would enhance my constituency. Another objective would be to promote and support strategic planning and sustainable development in and around the bay and make recommendations to regulate and control pollution, which I have already mentioned, in and around Dublin Bay. In this regard, I have mentioned the Doldrum Bay issue. This legislation should receive Government support. We do not want to hear the Minister state he is merely not opposing it or that he wants to delay the next Stage for 12 months. If we are serious about Dublin and enhancing both the public realm and citizens' life experience in Dublin, we should heed what we learned from the financial crash and Covid and what we are learning from the current cost-of-living crisis. We see people returning to natural interaction with the bay and its beauty and rediscovering it. The sad thing, however, is that they also rediscover just how poorly it has been protected over the years. I asked the Minister not only not to oppose the Bill but also to support the effort behind it and not have us wait perhaps 12 months for the next Stage. I congratulate my colleague Deputy Bacik and all those who have been campaigning for so many years to get us to this point, where we might be at the stage of having a statutory Dublin Bay authority.

I have had the pleasure of engaging with them and that is why I wanted to take this Bill myself. I very much appreciate the work of Deputy Bacik and her commitment. We can work together. There are some aspects of the Bill that might be conflicting, and I will outline those. I am not in any way raising them to criticise the legislation as they will comprise an important part of the discussion. The Bill will progress through Second Stage and then it will be up to Deputy Bacik, as ceannaire of Páirtí an Lucht Oibre, to take it to Committee Stage. We will work constructively with the Deputy.As the Deputy outlined, the Bill comprises the establishment of a new committee in the form of the Dublin Bay authority, with the purpose of preserving the character of Dublin Bay. We all share that objective. The Bill also seeks to make a specific amendment to the Bathing Water Quality Regulations 2008. I will talk about that in a little more detail, to fully understand the objective and purpose of that, and what impact it may have on the current EU directives. We will need to work through that. As the Minister with responsibility for this as well as for local government, I recognise and acknowledge that the protection of Dublin Bay is absolutely vital. It is crucial and it is well intentioned within this Bill. Deputy Ó Ríordáin mentioned the issues with regard to untreated sewage in Howth. Thankfully, we are seeing a reduction in that right across the bay. We are seeing the second treatment plant being commissioned in Ringsend and the work being done there to further improve the water quality. I have visited the plant but yes we need to do more. We have a €6 billion capital plan now for Irish Water that is agreed in the baseline that will allow it to continue with these major projects to ensure that leakage does not happen. There are some issues. I will be specific about them and maybe we can discuss them further and tease them through on Committee Stage. On amending the bathing water regulations in the manner proposed, I understand why this would be appealing at first glance, and I mean this in a positive way. I am not sure that as it is written would be the appropriate mechanism. I will explain why with a couple of points. On the establishment of a new body and the function of a new authority, the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly already has sufficient powers to set up such a committee as it sees fit under regulation No. 41 of the Local Government Act 1991, and the establishment order of 2014. To be fair, Teachta Bacik has outlined this. The assembly is required by the same order to "establish a strategic planning area committee in respect of each strategic planning area within the region". The Deputy referred to Fingal. Fingal County Council has set up a specific coastal strategic policy committee, SPC. I say this just so Deputies are aware of this too. The area identified in the proposed Private Members' Bill overlaps with strategic areas listed in that regional assembly's establishment order. With the establishment of a new authority, this overlapping would have to be dealt with. On the face of it, other aspects of the special committee proposed by this Bill seem to also duplicate the work of the Dublin Bay biosphere partnership. This is important because that partnership was established to facilitate the functions of the UNESCO biosphere reserve designation for Dublin Bay. We would have to figure out how that would work in partnership. The partnership works on: the conservation of biodiversity; cultural diversity; promotion of sustainable development; and support for research, monitoring, education and training. The partnership comprises Dublin City Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council, the Dublin Port Company, Fáilte Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. I have another concern around amending the regulation of the bathing water regulations in this manner, but I believe we could work this through and I do not believe it is the intention of the Bill. I am already taking action to protect winter and summer bathing in Dublin Bay, and to be fair I have raised this indirectly with the Deputy. The national bathing water expert group has looked specifically at year-round swimming, which is incredibly popular. I see it myself in Malahide and Portmarnock, at Low Rock and High Rock, and all the way up to Sutton. It is great to see that. I have had the pleasure of engaging with stakeholders in my constituency of Dublin Fingal, and beyond in the other local authorities as well. Right now, the local authorities are continually investigating potential sources of pollution such as underperforming sewer overflows and missed connections to the surface water drainage system. I will give one example. We had an issue in Portmarnock recently with a pump station that was due to be replaced. Unfortunately, a planning challenge was taken to that. Money had been allocated to replace that pumping station but we cannot do it as it has been tied up in judicial review and we have had continuous problems with the pumping station. That is just one example. I specifically asked Irish Water to study the use and benefits of the additional and extended use of ultraviolet disinfection at the Ringsend waste treatment plant. I have also ensured that water quality testing is undertaken across the bay during summer and winter, and that all of this data is made available online for anyone to access. This proposal is very well intentioned. I have some apprehension of the approach being proposed, and I will explain why. Under the EU rules, bathing waters are designated where a large number of people bathe and where water quality is suitable. The regulated bathing water season in Ireland runs from 1 June to 15 September. This period for bathing was selected with reference to the World Health Organization guidelines. If we extended the EU directive designated bathing water season into the winter, it increases the potential for adverse results and may unnecessarily put summertime designations in jeopardy. We must be careful about how we do that. Many people I have discussed the matter with would like to see the water quality all year round, and to be able to see the testing all year with the publication of the test results all year round. If we extended the bathing season and if we had significant weather events, there is potential for water run-off to decrease water quality in the winter months. If we extended the bathing season into that period, the calculation of that might actually impact on the summer bathing season as well. Again, this is something we can work through on Committee Stage. As it is written now, it would be a very real risk that the water quality criteria for designation may not be met, with a result that the designation would be withdrawn for the calendar year as a whole, including summer period. None of us wants that. I am aware this is not the intention of the Bill but we would have to work it through. This is not a matter of more pollution, but it is simply a fact that in the winter there is less sunlight, which means less sunlight to kill the bacteria in the water, and a much higher frequency of heavy rainfall events. Poor winter results would potentially cause bathing waters to be closed or redesignated for the entire year. Again, we would need to work through that piece. It might also be useful for the Deputy to know that we have a really good team on the water quality piece within my Department, and post this recess maybe we could arrange a specific briefing on some of these matters to see what type of amendments we could work on within it. I am not saying we would agree with them all, but this is genuinely a real concern of mine. Not designating bathing areas in winter does not mean, nor should it, that we cannot or do not take suitable measures to protect those people - and I see them - who are brave enough to get into the cold water on a winter's day. There are people who swim on 365 days per year. I must say that I admire them but I am not one of them.

That is a matter of opinion. I have appointed a research team from University College Cork, UCC, to consider the findings of a recently conducted public survey to help gather the evidence base needed to identify bathers' behaviour and investigate the feasibility of real-time monitoring. That is what I would really like to get to. People could make up their own minds then. If people have the information, they will know where they may go in the winter or may not go, and obviously there will be certain risks from time to time with regard to public health. The research will inform public future policy on out-of-season open water swimming. UCC researchers are engaged in that right now. It is my intention that this research will provide the basis for guidance that allows people who swim during the winter to make informed decisions. This is what they will do about the quality of water outside of the designated bathing areas. Resourcing also needs to be looked at. Should we move forward with a proposed authority - and I am not saying "no" to that, but I have outlined to Teachtaí here today where we would need to deal with overlaps and deal with existing responsibilities that are there. We would also need to look at how we would fund an authority like this. We could not have the authority set up like this without a dedicated budget and staffing included. It would require the requisite support, proper administration and governance. In conclusion, I assure Deputies that I am not opposing the Bill but this does not mean I am supporting it. The thrust of the Bill is something we can work on. I have outlined some of the areas around which the Government and I have some concerns. I have some reservations.I fully respect the commitment of Deputy Bacik and others, including Deputy Devlin, to whom I have spoken many times about this, and all colleagues who contributed this evening. I think we can work together on seeing how we could move this Bill through together and deal with some of the points I have raised. The Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly already has ample powers to establish a committee. We need to look at that. That may be an avenue we can go down, seeing what the assembly will do. The local authorities are a crucial part of that. For the information of the House, and judging from my engagement with the chief executives and directors of services and water services of the three Dublin coastal local authorities that have bathing areas within them, they are all very supportive of helping in respect of year-round testing and public information, but I would like to get to the real-time piece for people too. I very much welcome this debate and the work Deputy Bacik has done as well as her long-standing commitment to this issue, which I acknowledge. I will work with her on this. It might be useful if I were to arrange for my officials to meet directly with the Deputy in January to work through some of the issues I have put on the record of the House this evening. I thank the Deputy again.

I think I can safely say that I say that on behalf of the Save Our Seafront campaign, of which I am chairman, a group that has campaigned for many years on bay- and seafront-related issues in Dublin Bay. I am therefore very glad to support the Bill. Obviously, we would need to tease through all the detail, but I am sure Deputy Bacik is open to that.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	295	The point is that the general principle is right. We need some body that is genuinely representative of all stakeholders, all those who have a real interest in protecting and enhancing the bay, protecting its biodiversity as an amenity, representing the various stakeholders in the bay area and ensuring that the water quality is the best it can possibly be. That body should have real power and teeth and, critically, should be genuinely representative of all stakeholders. That is the key. I will flag just a few issues that are important in that regard, some of which have been a preoccupation of the Save Our Seafront campaign for many years. I commend the Save Our Seafront campaign on its work. We were set up in, I think, 2004. It still has a great standing committee that has been very active all those years. Some of its leading members have passed on. I remember the very first meeting we had was in the Dún Laoghaire Christian Institute and was attended by John de Courcy Ireland. He was one of the founding members of Save Our Seafront. He was a mariner, a socialist, a lover of the sea and the harbour, somebody who had campaigned for many years, even before Save Our Seafront was set up, and somebody who should be long remembered for the passion he had for marine and maritime issues. A further commemoration of John de Courcy Ireland is something we should think about in Dún Laoghaire and elsewhere. Bob Waddell, who was, I think, the founding member, or certainly for a long time one of the leading figures, of the Sandycove and Glasthule Residents Association, was on the committee of Save Our Seafront and was a real voice in that campaign on many bay-related issues. That campaign began over an issue to which Deputy Bacik alluded in her contribution, the Dún Laoghaire baths. The story of the Dún Laoghaire baths is illustrative of both the dangers and the potential of developing our seafront and Dublin Bay amenities. When the campaign was first set up there was, incredibly, a plan, backed by the majority of political parties on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council at the time, for a 19-storey office block to be built on the site of the Dún Laoghaire Baths. I ask the House to think about that. Save Our Seafront was set up and campaigned on that basis. I remember our first protest. I would say we had about 30 people there when we began.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	297	No, it was not, but from small things important ones often grow. We built up the campaign against that horrific proposal. Subsequently, there was another proposal for a ten-storey apartment block. In Dún Laoghaire, just east of the east pier, the entire area from Teddys ice cream to the east pier would now be blocked out from the main road if that proposal had gone forward. At the time, however, we mobilised thousands of people in a huge series of demonstrations, culminating in a massive demonstration on Scotsman's Bay. Christy Moore played at that. We had many other artists and other people up from the Shell to Sea campaign, another sea-related campaign at the time, to speak. That mass movement of people power forced the abandonment of the proposal. That was a huge victory for people power. At the time, the central argument we had to take on was that there had to be public-private partnership. In other words, in the development of the harbour, the sea and the seafront amenities, private capital had to be in there somewhere. The trade-off for getting anything on the seafront would be that some private interest had to make money; therefore, we had to have an apartment block or an office block in order to get a swimming pool or some sort of amenity. We rejected that because we knew that once we accepted that principle, we were effectively privatising the seafront and what we would get would benefit private investors and very wealthy people and would not protect the amenity as a public amenity for all. That is the critical point about Dublin Bay. It has to be an amenity for all. The seafront is an amenity for all. It should never be the province of an exclusive group of people or people who are simply trying to exploit it for money. It is incredible that we are now 16 or 17 years on and finally, next week, the Dún Laoghaire baths for which we campaigned and got agreement in principle will reopen as a public amenity without apartment blocks or office blocks but, shockingly, still without the pool we campaigned for. They have left a space for it, but there is still no pool. There will be a swimming jetty, and that it is great, and it is far better than privatisation, but it is extraordinary that after all those years we still will not have the swimming pool. Again, I remember at the time when we argued against those mad proposals and said we should have a public seawater swimming amenity, we were told that seawater swimming was completely out of date and that people would swim only in heated pools. That was one of the main objections at the time. How wrong can you be? Seawater swimming has now exploded and is a massive interest. We are nearly there but we still want our pool. The point is that the belief that we had to somehow exploit the seafront for money was what threatened it as a public amenity. That brings me on to a few other issues. We all know we need offshore industrial wind to have alternative sources of electricity, but it is completely wrong that private, for-profit developers have selected the sites for the development of that rather than a democratic planning process or something like a Dublin Bay authority. The private developers have selected the Kish Bank, a very sensitive area adjoining a UNESCO biosphere, which could very seriously and detrimentally affect Dublin Bay as an amenity from all sorts of points of view.That should be done in a democratic, planned and environmentally sustainable way. It should not be private developers dictating where wind farms go. I wish to flag that as still being a very important issue for the people of Dún Laoghaire and I suspect all of Dublin Bay. Dún Laoghaire harbour is another precious resource. Save Our Seafront campaigned for many years for the dissolution of the essentially commercially orientated harbour company and for the harbour to be brought under democratic control, which we eventually succeeded in doing. Recently the old Stena Line terminal building was essentially handed over in the face of our opposition to a private company that wanted to develop a digital hub in the building. We opposed this because we believe it should be developed as a public amenity. We were told in June that the digital hub that was going to be developed by this private company was "shovel-ready" as soon as it was handed over. Not a thing has happened to that terminal building. I have it on reasonable rumour that this private entity is going to collapse and we will be left with a terminal building sitting in the middle of the harbour that should be used to develop a national water sports centre, greater access to the sea and access to that wonderful amenity that is the harbour and the bay. I want to address the issue of water quality. I thank Melisa Halpin for putting forward motions looking for more testing of water quality about two years ago. The Minister has alluded to key issues in that regard. When it rains, foul water mixes with rain water and sewage goes into the sea on a regular basis because we have not invested in the rehabilitation of a Victorian pipe network in the area. That investment needs to happen. Even when it is upgraded, the sewage treatment plant will not be enough to deal with the capacity that is necessary to ensure the water quality in Dublin Bay and so measures need to be taken urgently in that regard.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	298	I thank Deputy Bacik for introducing this very good Bill. It is also welcome that the Minister is welcoming it and will work with it on Committee Stage. Dublin Bay is hugely important to everyone in this country, not just people living close to the coast. It is an environmental jewel that needs to be protected. During Covid, many people discovered swimming and how important and healthy is sea swimming. Before Covid, I would not have gone near the coast but for some reason it was probably one of the few activities you could take up during Covid. It is so healthy and really helps your mental health. I find it really good for re-setting the system. This Bill would see the bathing season of Dublin Bay changed to cover the entire year. It is important to acknowledge that in 2008, our constituency colleague John Gormley set out minimum requirements for bathing water testing under the Bathing Water Quality Regulations 2008. That was a first, was needed and showed great foresight. It is something we need to build on. Times have changed, things have moved on and we must move on with them. An authority such as that proposed would be worth looking at. Raw sewage was mentioned. I sometimes go swimming out at Red Rock. I only recently discovered that 40 houses near Howth are spilling sewage into Dublin Bay. Irish Water has indicated that it will be 2025 before a treatment facility is put in place to address the fact that sewage from these 40 homes goes into the bay. Dublin City Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council take a much more proactive approach and test all year round, including several popular swimming sites that are not designated as bathing locations. My understanding is that there are just two designated bathing areas, Dollymount and Sandymount, and four non-designated, Merrion, Shellybanks, the Half Moon and the North Bull Island causeway. Effectively it is almost impossible to swim at the Merrion site. I know the last three tests have been red flags. In the Dublin City Council area, there are only two designated bathing areas and four non-designated bathing areas that are also tested. We need a live dashboard that monitors leaks from the Ringsend treatment plant, which was mentioned. This has a significant impact. Almost every time it rains, raw sewage flows out into the bay and has an adverse effect on the entire bay. Almost every year, ectocarpus, a foul-smelling algae bloom, is found along Sandymount Strand. It makes Sandymount Strand almost unusable for walkers. All you can say is that the smell is disgusting. It smells like raw sewage. In Dollymount, they scrape it off and pile it high. I have worked with Dublin City Council on this and challenged it about it. It maintains that ectocarpus is a natural algae bloom and of course it most certainly is but the amount of this foul-smelling algae is completely unacceptable. I am convinced and Dublin City Council begrudgingly admits that it has something to do with overflow. The nitrate from the raw sewage feeds the algae so we have vast volumes of algae, which sometimes makes Sandymount Strand unusable. It is something we need to address and acknowledge because I do not believe Dublin City Council has fully acknowledged or is willing to acknowledge openly that this is the case. As has been said, the wastewater treatment plant is already damaging the environment. Even when the works are done to complete the additional capacity, it will just be at capacity for the people it serves. If there is any heavy rain, and living in Ireland there is a fairly good chance of a lot of rain, there is ongoing contamination of Dublin Bay by raw sewage. The amount of waste from the Liffey, the Grand Canal and the Tolka that flows into Dublin Bay is horrendous. The Government needs to increase funding for projects such as Jimmy Murray's Liffey Sweeper project. It is a positive and constructive project that works and employs local people, including young people who might find it challenging to get jobs in other sectors. This is a really good project. It is a win-win. There are no downsides to this. It cleans the Liffey. I saw that Flossie Donnelly, who does a lot of work around cleaning up the bay, posted a photo of a young seal on a mattress that had been swept into Dublin Bay. It would not take a huge amount of resources to fund the Liffey Sweeper and it is really effective. Dublin City Council has invested in it. It is important to acknowledge the commitment of Dublin Port, which has shown its support for the bay in general and the Liffey Sweeper project.From more than 11 sampling trips undertaken by the Liffey Sweeper, a total of 4,114 kg of debris was extracted. Indeed, 70% of that waste removed from the River Liffey is recycled. If it was not taken out of the River Liffey, it would end up in Dublin Bay. We cannot just look at Dublin Bay in isolation. We have to look at the waterways that feed into it, and we must expand projects like the Liffey Sweeper to cover the Dodder and the Tolka rivers and the Clontarf estuary. I know the Liffey Sweeper has been used in Grand Canal Dock to clean it up. In the Liffey and Dublin Bay, tidal movements move waste on, but in the canal areas such as Grand Canal Dock and George's Dock, the waste just sits there. It has to be taken out by hand or net. The Liffey Sweeper does that and the workers do a fantastic job. The Tolka River and Grand Canal Dock are probably two of the most polluted waters in Ireland, according to new research published this year. The biosphere co-ordinator for Dublin City Council, Mr. Dean Eaton, has been mentioned by other speakers. I met him a number of weeks ago and he gave us a presentation. The Dublin Bay biosphere partnership is overseen by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Dublin Port and Fáilte Ireland. It is a very good initiative. It has to be given teeth, as has been proposed. I know Mr. Eaton goes to great lengths to promote Dublin Bay in terms of education, awareness, tourism, conservation, research, recreation and cultural heritage. He has done a huge amount of invaluable work with very limited resources, and he has published a biodiversity conservation and research strategy for 2022 to 2026. It is most important that all Members participating in this discussion take a look at that and take it in. It is an important guiding piece of work. I underline the need to support projects like the Liffey Sweeper to ensure that the Liffey and Dublin Bay are clean. It is a good community project.

Having heard what the Minister said on the collaboration that is going to happen from here on with this, it is important to bring into focus the issues that many of the Deputies have spoken about today and the need for us to work as a collective of Deputies representing all coastal constituencies across Dublin, and indeed those who do not but who have a great affinity with the amenity of Dublin Bay. I acknowledge and thank the SOS Dublin Bay group, among others. My colleague mentioned Flossie and the Beach Cleaners, an organisation that has done fantastic work along the coast, as has Ms Margaret Brown, founder of Sandycove Tidy Towns, and others. My constituency colleague Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the late Bob Waddell, who passed away, sadly, in January 2019. He was exceptionally good at communicating with all local representatives. His input into various community organisations is missed. Turning to the Bill itself, I note that section 4 states the authority will "propose and promote policies and priorities for the protection and enhancement of the environment of Dublin Bay and of the natural habitats and wildlife in and around the Bay". As was said and as was alluded to by the Minister, a vast number of water quality notices are issued. Speaking as a representative of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, I can say that it is frequent, particularly at this time of year, that water notices are issued and swimming is prohibited, unfortunately. As others have highlighted, swimming has become very popular. It became popular before the pandemic, but there has certainly been an explosion of interest and use of Dublin Bay since then. Deputy Bacik told us about her swimming group that meets regularly. There are many other such groups, some of which are formal. I know of groups in Sandycove, the Forty Foot, as well as in Killiney, Sandymount and Seapoint in my own area. There are many groups and the interest is there. Obviously, there is huge frustration when we see these poor water quality notices being issued, many of which are avoidable, and the impact they have on swimmers and people. While I welcome the €6 billion investment, there are still challenges that remain. It is not just purely about the waste treatment centres and the treatment of run-off from roads. There are a whole range of issues. We have spoken about the Dublin Bay biosphere. Mr. Dean Eaton was mentioned by Deputy Andrews. When I was on the council, Mr. Eaton was an employee of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and went on to work as Dublin Bay biosphere co-ordinator. He and his colleagues have a great passion for their work. The work they are doing is extremely commendable and is important for raising awareness. I note that in the proposed Bill the aim is to promote and support the strategic planning and sustainable development in and around Dublin Bay as well as promoting the various benefits of the bay. What is also important about the proposal around the Dublin Bay authority is how that organisation or structure is formed. That will be teased out on Committee Stage. We obviously have to be aware of the EU directives in place. That is known and recognised by all concerned. Ultimately, we want to work collectively with the various volunteers who have a great passion and love for the area and who have really championed this, to give them their due. We also want to ensure that, as political representatives, we bring together the various organisations and agencies involved, of which there are many, as the Minister alluded to earlier. We need to ensure the local authorities and the various agencies are working in tandem with each other to ensure we bring forward some mechanism to improve water quality all year round. I welcome that the Minister is committed to ensuring we get real-time information. That is sorely lacking. At the moment, there are some people who are not aware of the prohibitions that are in place. Swimmers have to search for that information before they go swimming. The information should be readily available. The results of all-year round testing should also be made public for the various bathing areas. Deputy Bacik has done a great service by ensuring we, as the Oireachtas, are examining what can be done for Dublin Bay to improve water quality, the benefits of which will be felt not only by those who swim in the but also by the rich biodiversity in our bay. I welcome the Bill and look forward to it progressing to Committee Stage shortly.

The contents of the bay used to come into my room every winter when I lived in Sandymount, before the promenade was built. The sea would come over the wall and bring with it the contents of half of the beach, across the road and into the downstairs bedroom. I have great memories of Sandymount strand in particular, the bay in general, and the amenity it was for us as young kids. For most of my young life I did not wear shoes. We would wake up in the morning and go straight across the road to the beach, come summer, winter or whatever. We gathered all the driftwood from the beach to heat the house. I do not know what our neighbours in Sandymount thought of us going about with a trolley collecting driftwood. The bay was not as polluted then, despite the fact that huge mounds of the city dump, which was in Ringsend at the time, fed into it. It was kept closed, but every now and again we found the contents of the city dump on our doorstep because they would end up in the water in a big storm or whatever. We did not have the algae that now stinks the place out for many weeks during the summer. Sometimes there was seaweed rotting, but never to the degree that there was a foul odour in the air on an ongoing basis.As Deputy Andrews mentioned, that is to do with the waste treatment plant. It has to be; there is nothing else feeding into that water at that level on a continuous basis. When we were younger, we could dig down into the sand and it was not black. Then, for years, it was black under the surface. That was again the contribution of wastewater going into the system. It was in some ways a time of innocence. I do not know what the pollution levels were in the water when I was growing up. It did not do me any harm but the pollution levels now are much worse and much more dangerous because of the pollutants in existence. There is much more we could do. Any other capital city with as much of a natural habitat on its doorstep and with as much of an amenity would do more. When we think about it, we are looking for sporting grounds and so forth but it is there on our doorstep. It was on my doorstep but it is on anybody's doorstep because Dublin city is not that big. We could do much more in terms of water sports. I am not looking for jet skis up and down the bay. They could be part of it but in a confined area. When we were younger, I was involved at a very young age in the campaign to save Sandymount Strand when there were proposals to run a motorway across the strand. That was part of the eastern bypass, as it was then known. We were called backwards. We had swimming pools in Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire on the south side. As a young fellow I did not know that much about the north side. We also had the ruins of the Sandymount baths in which one could swim, just about. It was left sitting there and went to rack and ruin. There were swimming pools, however. We could utilise those through the city council or this new authority. We could have seaweed baths and the likes of that. We could do a lot for very little cost to enhance the beauty and usability of that natural resource. I welcome this Bill; it has to happen. Regardless of whether it happens through this Bill, there must be greater co-ordination and investment in the natural resource we have. I thank Deputy Bacik for bringing it forward. Hopefully, it does not stop at Committee Stage. We must act quickly, in this Dáil or another Dáil, on the treatment of the wastewater and other pollution going into Dublin Bay. We have had far too many of what they call "brown trout" floating around in the water. That discourages people from swimming in our seas around Dublin. We need to get a lot more people back swimming. It is good for our health, the skin and everything else - if the water is clean.
#MalcolmNoonan	unknown-#MalcolmNoonan-party	unknown-#MalcolmNoonan-dob	unknown-#MalcolmNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	301	I thank Deputy Bacik. I congratulate her on her recent graduation. I commend her on bringing this Bill forward. It is timely and brings together many initiatives around the conversations we have been having within our Department and also with stakeholders such as SOS Dublin Bay regarding the future of the bay. I thank all the Deputies for their contributions. We all want to achieve the same objective in terms of biodiversity but also with regard to the bay as an amenity. There is an opportunity to move forward in a spirit of collaboration across the House to try to do that. A number of issues were raised, particularly by Deputy Andrews, with regard to the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant. Separately, a recent Environmental Protection Agency report about the impact of dog faeces on the beach indicated that this is actually impacting on the water quality where people are swimming. In terms of the positives, there will be a new urban wastewater treatment directive in terms of the catchment element, the next iteration of the river basin management plan and many really good initiatives going on. I take note of the issue of the Liffey Sweeper. There is a biodiversity action fund in the local authorities administered by our Department. Lots of really good work has been done by our Department in partnership with companies like Intel around the Liffey headwaters and the River Rye. We are looking at nature-based solutions to the issue of urban wastewater run-off. We need to start embedding those types of policies in order to look at water quality in the bay as part of a whole-catchment approach rather than in isolation. That is at the end point - the receiving end - of where this is at. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, outlined the Government's response in terms of the impacts of extending the EU designated bathing water season in terms of testing. That could potentially have adverse impacts. We have appointed a research team from UCC to consider the findings of the public survey, to help to gather the evidence base needed to identify bathers' behaviour and to investigate the feasibility of real-time monitoring and communicating. Communication is vital, particularly if there has been a significant rainfall event. It is advisable not to swim perhaps two or three days following such an event. That would be the norm and it is good advice. Communication is a critical part of it, however. I take the points raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh. Dublin Bay is something that is culturally important to the people of Dublin. We feel we have an opportunity here to achieve something. Deputy Andrews mentioned my former colleague, John Gormley, who is an avid Dublin Bay swimmer. He can be seen out there regularly. I thank our team in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which is consistently working with stakeholders to try to address these issues. I thank the Deputies for their contribution to the debate on this Private Members' Bill. Dublin Bay is a unique and precious place that provides a valuable amenity and heritage so close to our capital city. As such, the characteristics of the bay and the amenity it offers must be protected and enhanced. This is beyond question. In fact, it was recognised by UNESCO designation as a UN biosphere reserve in 2015. We have broad agreement on the importance of the bay and, hopefully, on our next steps. As the Minister set out in his earlier contribution, the Government has been conscious of the evolving and changing uses of the bay and the efforts already under way to protect the bay, its biodiversity and its water quality. The Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly and Dublin Bay biosphere partnership are in place. We are testing the water throughout the year beyond the legal requirements and those results are available online. I have already mentioned the research that is under way to investigate the feasibility of providing near real-time monitoring results and communicating even more detailed quality data to the public. This is hugely positive. Again, that has been brought about through collaboration, partnership and perhaps the odd argument as well. We appreciate that; it is all part and parcel of it. This proposed Bill is well intentioned. The Government will consider it in light of tonight's Second Stage debate. There is an opportunity here. I thank Deputy Bacik for bringing it forward. It is brilliant that we are debating it this evening and taking on board the issues that have been raised across the House by Deputies in terms of the public amenity, the biosphere and the cultural importance of Dublin Bay to the people of Dublin and Ireland. It is critical that we move forward in a spirit of collaboration to try to advance our common objectives in that regard.

#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-08 00:00:00	Message from Select Committee	303	I thank the Minister of State for his very generous closing remarks and, indeed, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for his very comprehensive response earlier. I absolutely agree with the Minister of State. I would be delighted to move forward with this Bill in a spirit of collaboration as he and the Minister have suggested. Indeed, I already indicated to the Minister that I will take him up on his offer of meeting with officials in January to see how we can make progress with this Bill. I have a good track record of working from Opposition with the Government to ensure the passage of legislation. I am absolutely open to amending and improving on the Bill, where necessary, to ensure we see the principles it enshrines brought in. I absolutely acknowledge that a great deal of good work is going on to improve and enhance the amenity of Dublin Bay. The core issue here is the lack of co-ordination, the lack of joined-up thinking and the lack of a framework within which the work can continue and within which there will be democratic accountability. There are four key principles I want to see brought in. They are currently lacking and this Bill would address them. One of them is the need to ensure adequate protection for the environment. That is absolutely huge. Clearly, as the Minister of State and others have pointed out, this is a biosphere. We have a UNESCO designation for the bay and we need to ensure that there is a proper framework in place to ensure its protection and sustainable development. Second, we need to ensure it is improved as a public amenity. The Minister of State correctly pointed out the cultural significance of the bay, as did Deputy Ó Snodaigh and others. I do not think anyone but Deputy Ó Snodaigh can claim to have had the contents of the bay come into their bedrooms. However, the stories other colleagues have told of their experiences of Dublin Bay and my experience as someone who swims in the bay every week speak to its cultural significance for all of us. Beyond the public amenity aspect, the bay has a visceral importance. The third issue is the lack of democratic accountability in the framework for the planning and development of the bay area. The fourth issue, and probably the overarching one, concerns co-ordination and the need for joined-up thinking. My colleague, Dermot Lacey, to whom I referred earlier and who has done much work to improve co-ordination of the Dublin Bay area, has spoken about how nine different statutory agencies currently have responsibility. We know there are four Dublin councils. Others have spoken about the great initiatives taken in Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Dublin City Council in respect of the bay amenity, but there is a need for a joined-up co-ordinating body with statutory power that will also have democratic accountability. That is what we seek to address in the Bill in order that the environmental amenity will be protected and the public realm will be too. Deputy Ó Ríordáin spoke eloquently about that. I am happy to work with Government to ensure that we can bring into being a legislative framework to address the four concerns around environment, public amenity, democratic accountability and co-ordination. I will speak on some of the issues colleagues raised. I acknowledge those who spoke and the great support we have got on a cross-party basis, not only from the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, but also from Deputies Boyd Barrett, Andrews, Devlin and Ó Snodaigh. I acknowledge Deputy Carroll MacNeill, who cannot be here but who previously indicated great support and who has worked with me on the water quality issue. On that issue, section 6 was addressed by the Minister in some detail. That section would seek to amend the bathing water regulations and ensure we have water quality monitoring and data over the whole year. I thank SOS Dublin Bay for working with me on this provision and I acknowledge the visitors in the Gallery and all the activists who have worked on the issue of water quality. I listened carefully to what the Minister said and have engaged with Uisce Éireann or Irish Water on UV testing. I am delighted about the UCC project that is under way. I was also delighted to hear both Ministers speak of the need for real-time monitoring to ensure informed decision-making for those who wish to swim in the bay. However, those comments illustrate the lack of coherence around the argument against year-round water quality monitoring. It is a little bit like the old, derided policy in the US military, “Don’t ask, don’t tell”. The argument is if we do testing year round and the water quality is poor, we will have to stop people swimming, the water will be designated as unswimmable and we will have to close designated swimming areas. That misses the point. We need to use the data to improve water quality and to change things. It is like telling someone not to go to the doctor because they might get a diagnosis. The point is to use the diagnosis to avail of treatment and engage in treating the water, improving water quality and trying to find out what is wrong with it. We do not want to swim in unsafe water - nobody does - but we want to swim year-round. I swam three times last weekend. There were huge crowds swimming around the bay. Colleagues have spoken of the huge numbers in their areas now swimming year-round. The reality is the whole of Dublin Bay is now a designated bathing area. My Labour colleague, Martha Fanning, swims at Blackrock DART station and Williamstown, which were not thought of as swimming areas and which are not designated as such. We swim off the South Wall at the Half Moon Swimming and Water Polo Club. It used to be a very underused area but now huge numbers of people use it. The whole year is now a bathing season because so many people have embraced it. It is not just about swimmers. Many others use the bay and would like to see water quality improved. I hear from constituents about dead birds, dead seagulls and even dead foxes on the beach. Others have spoken of dog fouling. It is a serious issue. There are huge concerns regarding sewage. We have spoken about the Ringsend waste water treatment plant. Not long ago, 300,000 tonnes of sewage sludge was dumped into Dublin Bay every year. Welcome measures are under way to address this, but we still lack a co-ordinated statutory framework to address issues around pollution and water quality and ensure protection for the environment and protection and enhancement of the public realm and the public amenity that is the bay. That brings me to the structure of the new authority. To address issues the Minister raised, we sought in the Bill to use existing frameworks. The Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly already has power to establish special committees and section 2 of the Bill would establish this statutory authority as a special committee. We are trying to use existing framework and structures to ensure co-ordination is possible. We seek to ensure there will be democratically elected members of the assembly who will be members of the authority and to build on the existing structures like the biosphere partnership to ensure joined-up thinking. I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State’s colleague, John Gormley, who in 2008 sought to bring a co-ordinated, cross-party, cross-institutional approach to the management of Dublin Bay through his Dublin Bay task force. That was an important initiative but ongoing issues around water quality, lack of enhancement and protection for the public amenity and environment of the bay indicate the need for a stronger overarching body to control the management, development and enhancement of the bay. This need was brought home strongly to me when I was first elected, had a tour from Dublin Port and heard of their great plans for development of lands along the South Wall. I have also seen their work with BirdWatch Ireland, which is welcome. I have met with Covanta, which has a huge stake in the area surrounding Ringsend and Poolbeg. We need to ensure that representatives of the public interest play a central role in planning what happens with Dublin Bay, not just at Poolbeg and Ringsend in my constituency or Sandymount and Merrion but all around it. The Bill refers to Dublin Bay from the Baily Lighthouse to Sorrento Point and that overarching control, management and co-ordination needs to be brought about through a measure like the Dublin Bay authority. I look forward to working with the Minister of State, his colleagues in government and colleagues cross-party to ensure this Bill or the principles in it are enshrined in law. I thank all the activists. I have mentioned SAMRA and SOS Dublin Bay but there is also the seal sanctuary, the Commodore's in Dún Laoghaire, Flossie and the Beach Cleaners, the Coastal Concern Alliance and many more who have worked hard on a voluntary basis to enhance Dublin Bay. I thank my political advisor, Chloe Manahan, who has worked closely with me on this, and Finbarr O’Malley, our drafter, who worked on the text of the Bill. It is such an important principle that we would see a co-ordinated statutory body with a democratic legitimacy and accountability, as well as the central responsibility for the planning, protection and enhancement of Dublin Bay. For far too long, we have talked about this. John Gormley spoke about it in 2008 and tried to work on it. We now need to see a whole-of-government approach, working with partners in opposition, to ensure future protection and enhancement of Dublin Bay. This Bill represents a necessary first step to change how we treat and see Dublin Bay, to stop us taking it for granted and to realise its remarkable potential, not just for all of us but also for future generations. I thank colleagues for their great support. I also thank our visitors in the Gallery for their activism and work. I look forward to working with others to ensure that this Bill becomes law.
