          <p eId="para_11">The first proposal, COM (2009) 1024, requires no further scrutiny.  Based on the fact that it does not apply to Ireland and is a technical Schengen matter in this specific case, it is submitted that it does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">Based on the information available, it is proposed COM (2009) 657, COM (2009) 684, COM (2009) 685 and COM (2009) 686 do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">With regard to item No. 16801/09, given that the proposal was scrutinised by this committee last year, including at a meeting with representatives from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and that it is likely to be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights this week to consider the approval of an opt in motion for Ireland to take part in the measure, it is submitted that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny by this committee and should be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for its information.

It is proposed this agreed proposal be noted.  However, it is also proposed it be forwarded for their information to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">No. 3 on the agenda is justice and home affairs measures.  I refer to item No. 117513/09 COPEN 247 + COR 1.  Given that concerns have been raised about the legal basis of this proposal, its possible implications for domestic legislation and that Oireachtas approval may be required if the Government decides to opt in to the proposal, it is proposed it warrants further scrutiny.  To this end, it is proposed it be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for detailed scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
