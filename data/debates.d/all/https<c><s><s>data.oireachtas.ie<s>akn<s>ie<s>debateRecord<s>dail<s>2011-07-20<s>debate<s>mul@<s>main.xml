        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_1">This is our last Leaders' Questions before the Dáil rises for the summer recess.  It comes on the eve of a critically important meeting for this country and for the future of Europe.  We have talked in this House again and again about the fact that while Ireland has spent the past two years doing its bit, making the correct decisions and taking the corrective action to ensure recovery, Europe has consistently failed to appreciate or implement a comprehensive Union-wide approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">On this side of the House we have watched as an agreed reduction in the interest rate on our loans slipped from Ireland's grasp in March but the Taoiseach still refuses to reveal the details of what we were offered via President Van Rompuy's compromise and what we were asked to do in return.  We have heard the rhetoric about diplomatic offensives but listened with amazement as the Taoiseach confirmed he has not had one single substantive bilateral meeting with a eurozone leader since becoming Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">We have been encouraged by some of the briefings that have come out of Europe this week, that they finally understand the need to get to grips with this crisis, but we discovered yesterday, in disbelief, that the Taoiseach has not spoken to a single leader in advance of tomorrow's crunch meeting.  Can the Taoiseach explain how people are supposed to be reassured that Ireland is well placed to take advantage of this crunch meeting when he continues to maintain a hands off, hope it will work out approach to his dealings with other European leaders?</p>

          <p eId="para_4">I remind the Deputy on this last Leaders' Questions before the summer recess that the interest rate involved here is the interest rate that his Government signed off on.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_6">That is the first point.  His Government signed off on that interest rate.  On 11 March, the Council of European leaders decided that there should be an interest rate reduction in principle applied to countries in a bailout.  That was a responsibility delegated to the Ministers for finance because the stress tests were not completed on the Irish banks at that time.  As I pointed out to the Deputy previously, the issues now the central focus of discussion among European leaders are the issues that Ireland put on the table, that is, the entire question of the fund, its flexibility, maturity dates, interest rates and a number of other options.  As we meet here this morning, the agenda for tomorrow's meeting of the eurozone leaders is under very active consideration.  Officials from our country went to Brussels yesterday evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">From that perspective when the Deputy asks a question about how can confidence be displayed here, I remind him that we did not ask to be in this loan repayment bailout situation.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_9">That is what his Government landed us in.  Because the Government has made a series of decisions here, whether about banks, recapitalisation or the analysis currently being carried out by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of the comprehensive spending review, we have brought about a situation where the European Parliament, the European Commission, the IMF, quite a number of European leaders and individual Commissioners have said that Ireland in its circumstances has met every one of the targets that have been set and has been ahead in a number of these.  This was evidenced by the response of the troika last week to the situation that now obtains, for which the Deputy gallantly went on the plinth and took full credit last weekend.  The Deputy is not shy about reminding us of who landed us in this mess in the first place.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">From that perspective, I look forward to the meeting tomorrow.  I hope that what comes out of tomorrow's meeting will be the start of a series of decisions taken by the eurozone leaders which will restore confidence and certainty, and deal with the issue of the legitimate anxiety and concern about contagion spreading from the Greek situation which simply must be dealt with.  That is the focus of discussions today.  From that perspective, I will speak to all of the eurozone leaders tomorrow when I have that opportunity to remind them of how this country has measured up against the conditions and the terms of the EU-IMF loan repayment situation, which are quite austere and challenging.  From that perspective, the conditions set out are being met and that is a demonstration that a country in bailout circumstances, such as Ireland is, can meet its targets.  I want to see that countries like ours which are in this situation are seen and will be seen to receive support from the European leaders.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">When I questioned the Taoiseach about the claims of a Labour Party Minister in a Fine Gael Government that citizens on the dole are making a lifestyle choice, he seemed to suggest he had no choice other than what is Government is doing.  He repeated that suggestion a minute ago.  He does have choices, however.  Is féidir leis an Taoiseach seasamh a dhéanamh, is féidir leis gealltanais an Rialtais a choinneáil agus is féidir leis fís a thaispeáint.  Sinn Féin wishes him well at the European emergency summit but he cannot go there as an observer or a spectator.  He can go there to do what he proposed in his five point plan.  An gcuimhin leis an Taoiseach sin?  Lest he forget, when cuts are needed they start at the top.  When accountability is needed it starts at the top.  When sacrifice is needed it starts at the top.  It does not start with the blind, the carers or the poor.  Today, however, because of the Taoiseach's choice the poor include people who are economically vulnerable.  Does he agree the people we represent cannot afford to pay our European partners the outrageous sum of €10 billion in interest?  Will he tell them that tomorrow?  Will he bring his five point plan with him and stick to it by making the right choices on behalf of the people we represent?</p>

Be that as it may, I want the Deputy to understand this Government has for the past four months been changing the agenda that had previously been pursued in Europe.  That agenda has changed through our diplomatic and political connections, as well as what we have been putting on the table about the need for Europe to change direction and deal with the European problem.  That is why the central issues at tomorrow's emergency meeting of the eurozone countries deal with the issues put on the table by Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">In general, we are attempting to have unemployed people engage with the system whereby retraining, upskilling and career opportunities can be made available for them.  I want to see as many people as possible involved in gainful employment and because the situation is changing, there is a need for upskilling and retraining.  That is as it should be and it is the focus of the Government.  Arising from the comments made yesterday, I hope that when we return in the early autumn to discuss job initiatives and proposals that Opposition Members will have constructive ideas on how the Government can engage and make further changes rather than live in a land of unreality such as Deputy Adams has been putting forward.</p>

Riddle me this: why is the Government taking money out of essential health services and putting it into banks when it is not obliged to do so?  It was a choice because they were not guaranteed.  The Taoiseach cannot blame anybody else.  Of course, these guys on the benches beside me made the mess.  They are not going to a European summit but the Taoiseach is.</p>

It contains proposals for a water charge in 2012 and 2013.  We hear the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is going to the Cabinet shortly with what will be called a utility charge.  As Head of the Government, will the Taoiseach clarify the policy?  Will the household utility charge be in addition to a property tax, or is it another name for that tax and will it replace it?  Is the household utility charge meant to cover a water charge as a catch-all in the sense that the people can be soaked under whatever brand name is required?  Will it be in addition to a water charge?  Are we talking about one, two or three new taxes and charges to be implemented next year by the Government as part of this disastrous proposal to salvage speculators?

          <p eId="para_228">I object again to a guillotine being imposed on the discussion on substantial legislation which is aimed at undermining the postal services and opening up An Post to privatisation in the long term.  Without going into the content of the Bill, enough time has not been given to discuss this.  Yesterday, after a number of hours of Report Stage, the House only managed to reach the fifth amendment of 40, which means that there are another 35 amendments on quite detailed legislation which has major implications.  A guillotine should not be imposed.  More time should be allotted to ensure the passage of this legislation is allowed at the very least a full debate.  I suggest that, rather than imposing a guillotine on this and on No. 20<i>b</i>, the Dáil should seriously consider sitting next week to allow time for both pieces of legislation to be discussed as well as other legislation and the outcome of the eurozone Heads of State and Government meeting and the situation in hospitals.  There is quite a bit.  Consideration should be given to lifting the guillotine to allow proper and fuller debate on these issues and, to facilitate that, to us sitting next week also.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_229">The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2011 is extremely serious legislation which provides for liberalisation of the postal services and is the beginning of the neoliberal agenda, dictated from Europe and elsewhere, inevitably putting massive pressure for wide-scale privatisation and deregulation in areas related to the postal services, cherry-picking by private entities and, undoubtedly, a race to the bottom in terms of wages and conditions for workers in the postal area.  It is out of order that the Taoiseach would confine this to at most two hours this afternoon.  There should be no limit on this.  All the issues need to be brought out.  There was an extensive discussion and intervention in the debate on Second Stage and the Taoiseach should lift this guillotine.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">The United Nations has declared that a famine is underway in parts of southern Somalia and that approximately 3 million people are in the affected areas, with 500,000 children described as being at risk of death.  It is reported it may be worst famine in 20 years following years of conflict, drought and an escalating food crisis.  Irish aid agencies have played a significant role in bringing this crisis to the attention of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I am conscious we have only today and tomorrow left in the House.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether it is intended that additional Estimates will be required to give additional aid to what is the first major famine of the 21st century?  Will the support of the House be required to approve additional aid?  Will it be necessary to deploy some Army personnel to give logistical support in the provision of such aid in Somalia, which may be necessary given the conflict situation there?  This would require the approval of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The Taoiseach has the full support of the Opposition for either of those two measures that may be required or for any additional measures that may require the approval of the House today and tomorrow.</p>

          <p eId="para_421">I appreciate that from Deputy Martin on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is an appalling situation which we see unfolding on television screens across the world.  I understand this crisis has now peaked, with the United Nations declaring a famine in two regions of southern Somalia, Bakool and Lower Shabelle.  I understand 3.7 million people are in crisis and 78,000 Somalis have fled the country to seek assistance.  Malnutrition rates in Somalia are currently the highest in the world.  In the last months, tens of thousands of Somali people have died as a result of malnutrition.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The Government has provided €5.6 million to UN agencies, Concern, Trócaire, GOAL and World Vision for emergency food and water, sanitation and health care.  Some €750,000 of this funding will help the UN World Food Programme to increase dramatically the distribution of highly nutritious foodstuffs to young children and pregnant women.  A further €250,000 is being provided to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for shelter, health care, water and sanitation for the Somali refugees who are fleeing to Ethiopia and Kenya.  In addition, 11 members of the Rapid Response Corps administered by Irish Aid have been deployed to the region.  As the Deputy is aware, the corps is made up of highly skilled volunteers who work with the UN and other humanitarian agencies in a crisis situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">I have spoken to the Chairman of the foreign affairs committee, Deputy Pat Breen, who has called an emergency meeting for early next week.  I thank Deputy Martin for his offer of support in whatever decision the committee might arrive at in order to add further to what Ireland can do as part of a European response to this first famine of the 21st century.</p>

In light of headlines in today's newspapers regarding a possible paedophile ring in County Donegal and the recording of nearly 2,400 sexual offences in Ireland last year, I note the Government has plans to introduce tighter controls on convicted rapists and paedophiles, including plans to tag convicted sex offenders.  What is the present status of that legislation?  Second, the former Minister for Justice and Law Reform gave a commitment in the House to introduce legislation to facilitate the provision of information to parents and those involved in providing employment to sex offenders and so forth, as well as to put that mechanism on a statutory footing in order that people in communities that may be at risk might be made aware, through An Garda Síochána, of a person's conviction.  This commitment has yet to be put on a statutory footing.</p>

These are to be backed up by legislation currently being drafted by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  This is a matter of obvious priority for the Government, which is the reason a Minister with specific responsibility for children was appointed.  I regret being obliged to read the appalling situation as outlined in newspapers today regarding a school in County Donegal.  I will let the Deputy know when the Government has a better fix on when the legislation will be brought before the House.</p>

I heard the Taoiseach speak in the Chamber about the importance of the Government's number one priority of getting people into employment.  However, there is a huge problem in respect of Garda vetting and companies and organisations are experiencing great difficulty in this regard.  I have encountered examples in my constituency involving waiting periods of six months and more to have people vetted.  Moreover, this mainly concerns the vetting of people who were unemployed and who were not coming from other jobs.</p>

The memorandum of understanding signed off on between the then Government and the troika and subsequently voted on by the Dáil means the questions of a site valuation tax and charges arising from water metering will apply.  The Government will make its decision in this regard shortly and will bring clarity and certainty to the matter.

I seek clarity on when Members can expect the heads of Bills to come before the Cabinet and when the Opposition can get an opportunity to consult the relevant Departments.

          <p eId="para_462">In respect of promised legislation, I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement this morning that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs intends to introduce legislation to deal with the recommendations arising from the recently announced Children First protection guidelines.  The Taoiseach will be aware of the recent horrific case that came before Galway Circuit Criminal Court, in which the horrific abuse perpetrated by a mother on her eight children was detailed.  The Taoiseach also may be aware that the mother and those eight children came from the Traveller community.  It is my view — my belief — that abuse would not have gone unnoticed and would not have continued without adequate intervention by the State if those children had come from the settled community.  My question, in relation to the proposed legislation, is when the Taoiseach expects it to come before the House.  The Minister has also initiated an investigation into the adequacy of the State's response.</p>

          <p eId="para_469">On Thursday, 14 July 2011, a 47 year old woman received a sentence of 24 years for pleading guilty to the assault and ill-treatment of her eight children, two boys and six girls, over a seven-year period from 2002 to 2009.  The final 16 years of the sentence were suspended.  The Health Service Executive confirmed that it had knowledge of this from 2000 onwards.  It became actively involved with the family in 2009, with a social worker working almost exclusively since that time with that family.  A number of members of the family are now in the care of the HSE and the HSE has also confirmed that the case has been referred to a 15-person national review panel which is chaired by Dr. Helen Buckley of Trinity College, Dublin.  The review panel was designed to create a standardised and systematic way of completing reviews of serious incidents such as this.  The report of the review panel will be submitted by the HSE's national director for children and family services to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs as soon as it is completed.  The HSE is actively involved at the moment in the provision of a multitude of services to this family.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is aware of the case and together with the Minister for Justice and Equality, will take this kind of situation into account in the drafting of the legislation following on the production of the children's rights issues published by the Minister this week.</p>

            <p eId="para_502">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">I am responsible to the Dáil for the general activities of my Department and parliamentary questions addressed to me must relate to public affairs connected with my Department or to matters of administration for which I am officially responsible.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">The presentation of my Department's Estimate to the Select Sub-Committee on the Department of the Taoiseach also provides an opportunity for members of the sub-committee to question me on a wide range of activities relating to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_505">There are, however, specific activities undertaken by officials of my Department for which I do not have official responsibility, for example, decisions made in relation to freedom of information applications or matters concerning release of files under the National Archives Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_506">My responsibilities in relation to European affairs include my participation in meetings of the European Council and other key European summits, as well as bilateral meetings and foreign visits.  Questions relating to international agreements and pacts, including those with EU partners and institutions, generally fall for answer by the relevant Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">I am also accountable to the Dáil in a limited way in respect of a number of State offices, for example, the law offices of the State and the Central Statistics Office.  By and large, I answer questions in the House in relation to matters of administration connected with those offices.  Similarly, the nature of my responsibility to the House in respect of any tribunal or commission established under the aegis of my Department is confined primarily to the arrangements relating to their establishment and ongoing administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">The specific nature of my accountability in respect of my Department and those bodies operating within its policy area has long been established by precedent in each.</p>
            <p eId="para_509">The procedures for dealing with parliamentary questions in my Department are long established and have not changed recently, nor do I propose to change them.  The Ceann Comhairle examines questions to ensure they comply with Standing Orders.  When a question complies with Standing Orders, I answer it.  However, in accordance with long-standing practice, questions are transferred to another Minister where responsibility for the substantive subject of the question rests with that Minister.  Ministers of State at my Department also reply to parliamentary questions in respect of their areas of responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_510">On Wednesday, 13 July, I presented my Department's Estimate to the Select Sub-Committee on the Department of the Taoiseach and also outlined the restructuring that has taken place in my Department recently and the way in which the Department supports me in carrying out the duties of my office.</p>
            <p eId="para_511">The 2011 Revised Estimate for my Department is €21.039 million.  This is an overall decrease of 27% on the 2010 Revised Estimate allocation.  On the administrative budget, the overall reduction in the Revised Estimate for 2011 is 14%.</p>
            <p eId="para_512">Of the programme subheads, there has been a reduction of 30% in the funding allocated to the National Economic and Social Development Office, 15% in the allocation for commemoration initiatives and 53% in the allocation for the Moriarty tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_513">If the full Revised Estimate allocation is spent it would represent an increase of 12% over the outturn for 2010, although I would be hopeful the Department will be able to come in well within budget as has consistently been the case in recent years.  The increase of approximately €2 million over the 2010 outturn relates primarily to one-off expenditure on salaries, wages and allowances related to the transition from the previous Government, plus costs related to events such as the visits by Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama, the State funeral for the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and the forthcoming presidential inauguration ceremonies.</p>
            <p eId="para_514">I have not made any changes to the Northern Ireland division in my Department.  The division continues to support me on all matters relevant to Northern Ireland, including my participation in the North-South Ministerial Council and the British Irish Council, and contacts with the Northern Ireland First Minister and Deputy First Minister, as well as with the British Prime Minister.  The division also plays an important role in co-ordinating matters relating to North-South co-operation across Departments.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_515">I tabled four out of the six questions that we are taking and I will take them in some degree of sequence.  I am endeavouring to get clarity from the Taoiseach as to the issues on which he is willing to answer questions.  I have written to the Ceann Comhairle on the matter and it will be raised at the CPP.  I specifically want to address the matter of questions being transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach.  Under the doctrine of collective responsibility it has long been the rule of the House that the Taoiseach can answer any question he wants.  Therefore when a question is transferred it is not because he cannot answer it, but because he chooses not to answer it.</p>
            <p eId="para_516">In Question No. 1, I asked for exact and not general details of the matters on which the Taoiseach is willing to answer questions.  The failure to give the requested list in the reply is striking and instead I got an answer about long-established precedent.  Will the Taoiseach instruct his officials that they should no longer, for example, transfer questions on contacts he has had with European Union leaders or leaders in Northern Ireland?  There comes a point when all the talk about reform is undermined by the reality of significant backward steps.  For example, can the Taoiseach explain how he can transfer the entire EU affairs section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Department of the Taoiseach last week while at the same time refuse to answer a simple question about the European Union Presidency in 2013?</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_335">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_517">The Deputy needs to get his research people to phrase their questions differently.  The difficulty is that he has not become used to Opposition yet.  It is a very different prospect from being over here as a Minister in various different Departments when he did not need to bother about this.  As I have known myself over the years, when a Deputy tables a question it goes to the Ceann Comhairle who decides whether it is in compliance with Standing Orders.  It then goes to a line Department.  In the case of the Department of the Taoiseach, if the substantive responsibility rests with another Minister, that is when a transfer for answer to that Minister takes place.  I do not see these questions until they appear on the Order Paper.  I have answered 260 oral questions tabled by the Deputy and others since the Government was formed, which is probably more than previous Taoisigh did in a term, but that is beside the point.</p>
            <p eId="para_518">If the question is in compliance with Standing Orders and is relevant to the issues I have raised here, I answer it.  I have no intention of changing the nature of the way which this is arrived at.  It is a question of the Deputy's researchers rephrasing the questions.  For instance he has asked a question about the Department of the Taoiseach being downsized by 50%.  His party might have had a view, but that is not what is in the programme for Government.  It is probably not the Deputy's fault, but perhaps he should instruct his researchers to phrase their questions slightly differently in order to be in compliance with Standing Orders and to deal with the issue for which the Taoiseach has responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_519">As the Deputy is aware, over recent years the issue of European affairs has become central to all with which we have to contend.  As Taoiseach I have responsibility there.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade obviously has a great deal of interaction with his counterparts at European level, which is why the second Secretary General, who I am glad to say will be taking up office shortly, will deal with the question of a far more streamlined European co-ordination element of what we have to do.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to answer questions on European issues.  Where I have responsibility, I will answer them and the second Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach will have a much stronger and more effective co-ordinating responsibility between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, because we both deal with elements of European issues on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">I have no intention of not wanting to answering questions from Deputy Martin or any other Deputy, but they should be, first, in compliance with Standing Orders and, second, relevant to matters for which I have direct responsibility.  If I am asked questions about European agriculture in so far as I might have dealings with Heads of Government about agricultural issues, it may well be that the substantive element of the question is more appropriate to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and in those circumstances that is where the transfer takes place.  I had the same problem over the years in opposition and I learned to phrase questions differently in a way that they are in compliance with Standing Orders but still get an answer from the Taoiseach of the day.</p>

That question was transferred to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Minister had been asked a series of questions by his Opposition counterpart and others.  I was asking the Taoiseach if he was aware, because this was a decision of the Government as a whole and he had accountability and responsibility to this House on the question.</p>

I could give him ten examples of how he might have phrased that question differently so that the Taoiseach of the day might be able to outline the responsibilities that rest with his or her office.

The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, the Tánaiste and I, as Head of Government, will have a direct involvement in the preparations for the Presidency, as will all other Ministers.  In fact, I discussed this at some length with President Buzek the other morning when he visited Ireland as President of the European Parliament.  We discussed the intense involvement of every Minister during the six-month period of the Presidency, which will be crucial for Ireland and Europe in a range of areas.  This is why I have issued an instruction to all of our Ministers and Minsters of State to attend at their informal Council meetings and begin to make real contact with their counterparts so that, when this comes along, they will be well acquainted with the issues and the facts.  It appears that a number of very big decisions may not be made before the end of 2012 and will have to be made during Ireland's Presidency.</p>

            <p eId="para_604">One asks about the Taoiseach's plans to make the Department accountable to the Houses and I welcome the information he has provided in this respect.  The second, which I will address in a moment or two, is on a different issue.  It is impossible for me to cram it all in and for the Taoiseach to give me and, therefore, the Oireachtas the information we request.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">Regarding the first question, there is frustration with the manner in which some questions are being lumped together.  Some of my questions have been disallowed or transferred to other Departments.  For example, they related to the Taoiseach's contacts with the social partners, 14-17 Moore Street, his efforts to secure a reduction in the bailout interest rate and the work of Cabinet sub-committees.  The latter issue is frustrating, given how Cabinet confidentiality is wrapped around it.  We cannot get information about the economic management council.  I have also asked about the Taoiseach's work in preparing for trade missions and his contacts with the British Prime Minister on issues such as Sellafield.  On some issues he has committed to reverting with answers, but I was not allowed to ask him about those when I tabled this question.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">We must find a mechanism to allow more discourse and more light to be shone on matters.  Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach i rith fheachtas an toghcháin, bhí an Taoiseach a rá go raibh sé an-mhacánta faoi rudaí mar sin agus go ndéanfadh sé rudaí i slí difriúil.  Could we just discuss this matter for a moment or two?  The Taoiseach was a long time in opposition.  With respect, it is not good enough to tell us that we are asking the wrong questions or tabling them in the wrong way.  Nor is it correct to claim that he is answering all of the questions.  He may have given answers, but there is a difference between that and answering questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">I will not make an issue out of another matter, namely, how the Taoiseach was not present during the last Questions to the Taoiseach.  He is fully entitled to delegate to another member of the Government, but there was not even an explanation for his absence.  I did not receive satisfactory answers to my questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_608">Deputy Martin asked two questions.  The first time I took Questions to the Taoiseach, I told Deputy Martin that we should consider ordinary Taoiseach's questions to see how we might get a better system going.  I have not changed the rules or regulations on the manner in which questions arrive in my Department.  They go through the Ceann Comhairle's office to see if they are in accordance with Standing Orders, then they come to my Department.  If the main responsibility rests with another Minister, the question is transferred to there.  I recall asking questions of previous taoisigh on many occasions, but there was an endless list of transfers.  I have not actually changed that.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">Deputy Adams asked two particular questions.  First of all, he is aware that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach over the years has always dealt with issues like the CSO, a number of other administrative areas and so on.  That has been the case for many years.  Questions put down for oral answer may not seek information that has been provided orally within the Dáil in the previous four months.  He could change the wording of a question and table it as a different question on the same subject.  Obviously, if an oral question is not reached, it goes down as a written answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">Deputy Adams has submitted two questions, one of which is on my plans to make my "Department accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas".  I answer questions here where they are my responsibility.  For instance, Deputy Adams as an elected Member was perfectly entitled to go to and ask any question at the meeting of the Select Sub-Committee on the Department of the Taoiseach at which we had a discussion for more than an hour on the Revised Estimates.  I cannot recall whether any member of his party was present, but he is entitled to go to any committee he wishes.  As I said in my reply, we had a detailed discussion at the sub-committee on my Department's Revised Estimates, just as any other Minister who goes before such a committee would.</p>

Would the Deputies prefer they would be answered individually, in which case there would be a discourse about who is first or second as the case might be?  There has not been any change; if these questions refer broadly to a sector, that is how they are answered.  I am happy to look at the way we deal with replies if Deputies want them dealt with individually or where the subjects are the same, grouped together.  There can be up to 20 questions grouped together; Deputy Martin did that when he was in government.  When he was Minister for Foreign Affairs he would take questions about everything outside the European Union together.</p>

Having published its second and final report, the tribunal is currently dealing with the matter of third party costs.  It has indicated to the Department that it is not possible at this stage to give any accurate indication of the timescale that might be involved in completing this task but has indicated that it will probably take quite some time.  As a result I do not know what the timescale is or what the adjudication will be in respect of those third party costs.  I cannot give the House an answer to that question because I do not know the answer until those decisions are made.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">I will communicate with the Deputy today, to demonstrate efficiency to him, about the numbers of personnel who might earn over €100,000 per year but I do not have the information here.</p>

            <p eId="para_632">I asked in Question No. 1 if the Taoiseach would give a specific list of public affairs connected to his Department and matters of administration for which he is officially responsible.  I asked him that question because it is an exact take from Standing Orders on questions to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach refused to give any specific list on what he is prepared to answer for in the House.  Despite all the talk of reform from the Taoiseach, we are in reality witnessing significant steps backwards, even in the reforms coming before us.  The Taoiseach has never asked me about Taoiseach's questions; he said that repeatedly for four months in the House but he has never made a single proposal on the conduct of Taoiseach's questions.  All that happened in terms of Dáil reform is that the Government Chief Whip met our Whip and said he proposed to give a half hour less time for Taoiseach's questions and that the Taoiseach did not want to answer questions on a Wednesday.</p>

            <p eId="para_635">It is absolutely unacceptable that the Taoiseach came in here this morning and tried to bluff his way through by saying I should ask the question differently.  When I gave the Taoiseach concrete examples of the questions I had tabled and the Taoiseach had transferred, he had no answer.  It is completely unacceptable that the Taoiseach would not answer a question on his role in preparing for the EU Presidency in 2013.  It is absolutely unacceptable he would transfer questions to him about his contacts with other Heads of State to the Minister for Finance.  It is absolutely unacceptable for the Taoiseach to transfer questions about his contacts with Northern Ireland leaders to other Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">On the tribunals, where the Oireachtas is involved in an issue of collective responsibility, it is also unacceptable for the Taoiseach to dodge questions put to him.  That is the Taoiseach's track record.  It is noticeable that the Taoiseach is breaking with precedent in the questions he is transferring and that he is trying to avoid answering hard questions.  The Taoiseach's political advisers have a definitive strategy of transferring all controversial question to other Government Departments.  That is unacceptable and undermines the Taoiseach's accountability to this House for matters for which he is accountable under Standing Orders.</p>

I have dealt with 260 of them.  Deputy Martin has been asking me questions such as "How long did you meet such a person for?", "What time did the meeting take place at?", or "What were the issues that you discussed?".  Why did he not frame his question to say "Will the Taoiseach confirm that he had a meeting with President Jerzy Buzek?" or "Would the Taoiseach confirm that they discussed Ireland's EU Presidency for 2013?"?</p>

            <p eId="para_667">Yes.  Why, for example, when I asked a question as to whether the Taoiseach had met personally with the EU-IMF delegation during their visit, was that transferred?  When I asked a question about the Taoiseach's role in the Economic Management Council, that question was ruled as being subject to Cabinet confidentiality.  In addition, a document that we got as new Deputies referred to the fact that the Taoiseach was supposed to answer questions on economic and social affairs.  However, time and time again, when I table questions on economic affairs, which is the area of most public concern, they are all transferred or disallowed.  It is unacceptable for the Taoiseach to say that a question should go to the Minister for Finance, particularly in the current economic climate.  The Minister for Finance is up for questioning every four weeks approximately.  Given the scale, depth and severity of the economic crisis we are facing, which is a fluid situation that is moving on a daily basis, as public representatives we must have an opportunity to ask the Taoiseach about those developments in our country's economic situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">While it is absolutely justified and legitimate for the Taoiseach to bat off detailed questions about economics or the country's finances to the relevant Minister, if we are asking questions about how to deal with the broad strategic orientation of our economic and financial policies in relation to the current economic crisis, the Taoiseach should answer those questions instead of batting them off, transferring them or telling us that they are subject to Cabinet confidentiality.  Given all the right talk about a new type of Government and politics, transparency and open government, it is not acceptable to have questions on these key issues batted off to some Minister or disallowed on some spurious basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_714">The issues that are subject to Cabinet confidentiality are the issues that are being discussed at Cabinet.  Climate change is certainly not an issue of Cabinet confidentiality in so far as we all talk about it as a general theory, but a matter dealing with climate change to be decided by the Cabinet will be subject to confidentiality until it is decided.</p>

            <p eId="para_717">I am getting nowhere on that.  A document given to us stated the Taoiseach would answer questions on economic and social affairs.  Given the severity of the economic crisis and the concern we all have with economic and social affairs, it is not good enough to have questions in these areas batted off to Ministers who can only be questioned once every four weeks and only then by a kind of lottery.  Will the Taoiseach be a bit more generous in answering questions on economic and social affairs as they are so important?</p>

            <p eId="para_718">That means the Deputy sits over there every morning and does not listen.  There is notice given on the Order Paper when questions are submitted.  I come in here every Tuesday and Wednesday and answer questions from the leaders about banks and water metering, and I answer questions from Deputy Higgins about economic and social affairs.  In so far as my responsibility as Taoiseach goes in chairing a number of Cabinet sub-committees, the issues under discussion for recommendation to the Cabinet for decision are subject to Cabinet confidentiality.  When the decisions are made, Members are quite free to discuss them openly and with responsibility in here, including matters such as household charges and water metering.  When they are decided by the Cabinet, as they will be, we can then discuss them quite openly without any fear of restriction.  Do I make myself clear?  The Deputy will get a lot of information and a lot of answers to many questions, and he will be a very happy little boy.</p>

          <p eId="para_880">As the House is aware, I will travel to Brussels tomorrow for a meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the euro area.  The meeting has been convened by the President of the European Council, Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, to discuss the future financing of the Greek programme and the stability of the euro area as a whole.  These are vitally important topics and the meeting will be an important one.  It is important to note at the start that it will not be the be all and end all.  The crisis in the euro area will not be resolved overnight.  There is no one magic solution or silver bullet.  At our meeting tomorrow, we will consider important proposals but there will be further meetings and further steps to be taken before this matter is finally resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Since the crisis began, a vicious cycle has emerged.  Pressure builds, a meeting is convened and expectations are raised unreasonably.  Decisions are taken but they are never sufficient to the address build-up.  Rather than gaining confidence, the markets are disappointed and pressure begins to build again.  The cycle continues.  This is corrosive and damaging, and the consequences are real for countries that find themselves at the centre of attention.  I hope we can have a measured debate which does not raise expectations beyond what can reasonably be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">That is not to say we should abandon all ambition for a strong and clear outcome which is credible, workable and durable.  The markets are watching and the pressure on member states has spread and intensified in recent weeks.  In our work tomorrow, we will focus on progressing the agreement reached at last week's meeting of Finance Ministers, which has been the subject of serious work by officials since then.  At their meeting, Ministers reaffirmed their absolute commitment to safeguarding financial stability in the euro area.  They stated that they stood ready to adopt further measures to improve the euro area's systemic capacity to resist contagion, including through increasing and enhancing the flexibility and scope of the EFSF, lengthening the maturities of the loans and lowering the interest rates and collateral arrangements, where appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">Ministers also discussed the main parameters of a new multi-annual adjustment programme for Greece.  As the House is aware, the Greek Government has demonstrated political determination and courage in securing parliamentary support for the serious reform programme which will be necessary if the country is to recover.  It deserves great credit for this and delivery on its programme will be tough but essential.  At their meeting, Ministers called on the Greek Government to sustain its efforts and to meet commitments in full and on time.  They noted that responsibility for resolving the crisis in Greece lies primarily with Greece but recognised also the need for a broader and more forward-looking policy response to assist the Greek Government in its efforts to achieve debt sustainability.  It was also accepted that there is a need to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole.  In that context, Ministers asked officials to propose measures to reinforce the current policy response to the crisis in Greece, including exploring how a new multi-annual programme for Greece would be financed, steps to reduce the cost of debt servicing and means to improve the sustainability of Greek public debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">The results of this ongoing work, which will be progressed later today at a meeting of key senior officials in Brussels, will form the basis of tomorrow's discussions.  It is, therefore, not yet possible to say what precisely will emerge from our meeting and, as we know from hard-won experience, it is unwise to speculate on these matters.  As I stated in the House yesterday, we need an outcome that offers certainty and security for the future.  My main priority will be to ensure an agreement that has positive implications for Ireland.  While the focus will be on Greece and the parameters for a new programme for that country, what is proposed for one member state cannot be taken in isolation.  The countries, like Ireland, which are already in a programme, as well as those which are coming under pressure in the markets, are alive to the real danger of contagion and negative read-across.  I will be watching carefully and working to ensure that what is agreed for Greece does not make our progress and eventual return to the markets more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">I will also work to ensure that any element of the new arrangements for Greece which might be of benefit to us is given wider application.  The Government has long argued for greater flexibility for the EFSF.  I am pleased to see this is now back on the agenda.  The point we have made all along is that the purpose of a programme is to contribute to recovery and growth.  This is a shared goal of the recipients of loans and those who guarantee them.  It is necessary that conditions be imposed but they should not be such as to undermine this fundamental and central objective or else we are all wasting our time.  The type of elements now being considered, including lower interest rates, longer term loans and greater flexibility of instruments, have the potential to make a positive contribution.  On interest rates, we know the specific issues that have arisen for Ireland and we will continue to press for the reduction in interest rates agreed in March to be applied to us.  However, a wider question also arises.  It is worth recalling that the complex method of calculating interest rates under the EFSF was agreed when no country had sought assistance from the facility and the question was, to an extent, academic.  There were some who argued that there was a need for the margin imposed to be such as to deter any member state from entering into a programme lightly.  This was presented as an argument against moral hazard.  In light of experience more realism has entered the debate and there is a wider appreciation that the strictures of a programme, namely, the pain of adjustment and the accelerated pace of reform, are more than sufficient deterrent.  No country would seek assistance other than in a situation of last resort.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">A number of other possible adjustments to the operation of the EFSF are also under consideration.  Until these are thrashed out more fully and tabled as proposals, there is little to be gained from speculating on what they might mean for Ireland and others.  However, as I have already pointed out, the Government has supported the principle of increased flexibility and I hope a positive outcome on this can be secured when we meet tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">I will seek an outcome that is good for Europe and for the eurozone, settles nerves in the markets and sends a clear and positive signal that we are going about our work in a committed and productive way.  We have all lost count of the number of times we have discussed in this House crunch meetings for Europe.  The crisis has been long and sustained and criticism of the decisiveness and leadership of key figures has become widespread and commonplace.  However, in the interest of balance it is important to remember that we are engaged in a process of learning in which new territory is being charted day by day.  This week's meeting will be important.  The danger facing the euro area and the very currency itself is real and present.  This week's meeting will not resolve all these matters but I hope it will demonstrate our capacity to act in a way that begins to restore confidence and momentum and arms us well for what lies ahead.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_529">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_888">While the specific agenda for tomorrow's summit is still uncertain there is no doubt about how serious the issues are.  The leaders have what may well be their final chance to show they are capable of addressing the crisis engulfing the eurozone.  There is no longer any doubt that only dramatic, fast and comprehensive action can stop the situation becoming much worse.  The key principles for action were agreed in February but the repeated delays and unforgivable inaction since then has spread the uncertainty which was supposed to be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">This summit is happening because the chairman of the euro group, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker, looked with clearly escalating panic at what is happening to Greece, Spain and Italy and understood there is no more time.  If Europe's leaders departed for their August breaks without taking action they might return to find a greater emergency and the end of the common currency.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Juncker, is an experienced and knowledgeable leader.  He does not exaggerate and he was right to request that the summit be convened.  It may well be that full and final agreement is not possible but the constant uncertainty which comes with acknowledging problems and failing to deal with them has to end and be seen to end.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">When Greece was given funding last year every country acknowledged that a more formal and comprehensive system for providing financial aid was now required.  This was done only in part.  Markets did not believe that the measures agreed were strong enough to deal with all possible eventualities.  Instead of properly appreciating how widespread the contagion could be, there was a belief held by many that the only issue was that of a few errant countries on the periphery.  This formed part of what lay behind the regular and deeply damaging briefings in October and November as a prelude to Ireland's financial programme.  At that stage it was again agreed that the programme was too inflexible and needed to be made less onerous.  No negotiation was possible on the interest rate because the policies agreed earlier in the year did not allow for it.  The parties in the new Government have consistently refused to acknowledge this until today in the Taoiseach's speech and they know that their posturing on the issue before the general election was part of just another short-term political game on their part.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">In the first two months of the year there was a strong sense that the European Union needed new policies to provide enough funding to be able to support even a large country; change the duration and cost of debt repayments to make them more sustainable; and introduce fiscal rules which would provide confidence in the medium and long term.  Each of these was agreed to in principle in February and included in the 11 March <i>communiqué</i>.  Unfortunately, only the fiscal rules element was implemented quickly.  The delay, uncertainty and anonymous briefings turned a confidence-building initiative into one which has had the opposite effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">The threat to the euro is not some abstract theory or the fantasy of doomsayers.  The common currency can only survive if member states continue to see that the alternative would be much worse and if investors have faith in it.  Ireland, with others, has always accepted very serious constraints on its ability to act because of its commitment to collective action by states, but the <i>status quo</i> is no longer credible and something must give.  For the sake of the European Union, I hope there is unbending resistance to debt restructuring rather than the currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">The Greek Government has taken many brave steps in addressing a fiscal crisis which has been developing for 20 years.  It has shown that it is different from its predecessors and deserves extra time and greater flexibility.  Greece does not have Ireland's export base or a number of our other long-term strengths and it started this crisis with a dramatically higher debt than ours.  There is no evidence that it can sustain its debt and repayment burdens and a failure to acknowledge this with each new plan continues to be a root cause of the escalating crisis.  Whether it is through buy-backs in the steeply discounted market or any other range of moves, Greece's sovereign debt needs to be restructured now rather than waiting for a more uncontrollable default in the future.  The availability of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, for a second round of financing needs to be fully nailed down by leaders.  A combination of a restructured debt, secure medium-term funding and the economic plans of the Greek Government can see the country through.  We should support it in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">The role of the European Central Bank in this matter has been, at best, controversial and, at worst, extremely negative.  At a time of such crisis the bank should not be falling back on technical rules to stand in the way of an essential policy.  Its threat to withdraw all funding for Greece if there is even a technical credit event confirms once again that its rigid orthodoxies serve the European Union badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">It has been this country's policy since last year to seek to impose significant losses on bank bondholders.  Our proposals were vetoed by the ECB because of its fear of a contagion, which has happened.  Unilateral action was not and is not an option because of other funding realities for the banking system and public spending.  However, the reality of the deep discounts which the markets have imposed on bond values shows that the risks arising from imposing significant losses on bondholders are lower than ever.  The late Brian Lenihan provided for this in legislation and imposed the first haircuts.  The Fine Gael and Labour Party Government likes to ignore this when using the legislation.  Where once the valid argument was that imposing bondholder losses would provide a fatal blow to Ireland's ability to return to the market, the evidence today is that the failure to impose losses is undermining our ability to return to the market.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, have repeatedly said they do not intend to raise the issue of bank bondholders until the autumn.  They have done this, even though they have worked to hype minor announcements as being deeply significant.  If the Greek debt issue is being addressed, so too should the Irish bank bondholder issue.  We took on large parts of the debt because of a Europe-wide policy of avoiding imposing investor losses.  If this policy is to be relaxed on the much more serious issue of sovereign debt, we must inform our colleagues that there will be significant losses imposed on bank bondholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">One of the most ridiculous developments in recent months has been the lengths to which the Government has gone to claim credit for developments in which it played no serious role.  The ESM announcement of a few weeks ago was a classic example of the genre.  On the Monday morning the Minister for Finance said it did not relate to Ireland but was welcome nonetheless.  By the Tuesday the Taoiseach was hailing a great strategic victory.  He appears to be the only person left in Europe who believes it was a wise decision to leave the debt and interest issue in the hands of the finance Ministers.  The hands-off approach failed miserably and the momentum towards action evident in January and February disappeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">Having spent months spinning the idea that Ireland had undertaken a diplomatic offensive, the facts show that there has been no initiative whatsoever.  During the general election the Taoiseach went to Berlin to show how he would lead from the front, directly engaging with European leaders.  In the four months since he has failed incredibly to hold a single bilateral meeting with a eurozone leader and yesterday he stated he had had no personal contact with a eurozone leader in the run-up to the emergency summit.  Just like his personal commitment to Roscommon County Hospital has now been denied, so too has his pledge in Berlin of personal diplomatic leadership been dismissed.  Given the amount of time the Taoiseach and his Ministers have invested in attacking predecessors for supposedly failing to meet people, the complete absence of personal action is incredible.  Perhaps if they had been less concerned with partisan attacks, they would have been able to arrange a diplomatic initiative.  There will be a reduction in Ireland's interest rate and there should be a move on the issue of bank debt.  The Taoiseach will no doubt be unstinting in his praise of himself, but any progress will happen because of an overall decision which he and his Ministers have played no serious role in influencing.  His approach has been to sit on the substitutes bench and claim credit for the goals scored.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Only three hours have been provided for the summit, including lunch.  Some are already trying to talk down the likely outcome, but the issues involved go beyond anything which can be spun for the sake of media headlines.  This is one of the most important summits in the history of the European Union.  It falls on the leaders to show that they can rise above the crisis and that they will take measures to help member states and restore confidence.  The can must not be kicked down the road again.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
          <p eId="para_899">It is welcome that there will be a special summit on the European debt crisis, but its handling by the Government since taking office has been appalling.  We heard much guff during the election campaign about not putting another penny into the banks and about Fine Gael acting differently.  Within the next ten days the Government will inject over €19 billion of taxpayers' money into the banks.  During the election campaign the Tánaiste was presented by the Labour Party as a Taoiseach in waiting and he declared that it would be "Labour's way, not Frankfurt's way".  The Government has set aside all of these commitments, shredded the manifesto and proceeded to implement Fianna Fáil policy.  It has also blamed Fianna Fáil for every decision it has had to take and Fianna Fáil stands condemned for the mess it created.  Fianna Fáil is no longer in government and its members are not going to the summit.  The Taoiseach will attend instead and will have choices to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">Sinn Féin wishes the Taoiseach well and wants him to stand up for the citizens of the State and Irish interests.  Our parties represent different interests and the reality is that our so-called partners in the European Union are set to benefit to the tune of nearly €10 billion owing to the penal rate of lending, which is scandalous.  The Taoiseach must renegotiate on this issue this week.  The leaders of France, Germany and other EU states have made decisions not in the interests of the European Union as a whole but in their own national interests and the Taoiseach should follow their example.  He should not see himself as a observer at the summit, rather he should make it clear that the EU plan for Greece, Ireland and Portugal has failed and that the medicine is killing the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">Ireland is unlikely to be in a position to return to the international bond markets in 2013 and Irish debt has been rated as junk by one of the leading ratings agencies.  The EU-IMF plan is junk and must be dumped.  The Taoiseach should say this clearly and directly.  From our perspective, the Government's priority at this summit needs to be to ensure Irish debt is brought to a sustainable level.  We cannot tackle this debt crisis by taking on more debt.  Payments to unguaranteed senior bondholders should be stopped.  If they are not, all bondholders will receive €4.3 billion before the end of September.  The closure of accident and emergency units is one of the social consequences of this policy.  Almost 500,000 people are unemployed.  Our elderly citizens are being forced to decide between paying bills and buying food.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">We could argue about the efficacy of the Government's negotiating strategy and tactics.  It has spent five months negotiating an interest rate reduction, but it has failed to achieve such a reduction so far.  When the reduction is agreed, it will save the Exchequer €150 million per annum.  It will not apply retrospectively to money that has already been drawn down.  In 2001, the Government has pumped €3.1 billion of taxpayers' money into zombie banks like Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  As I have said, our EU partners will benefit to the tune of almost €10 billion from the exorbitant interest they are charging on these loans.  While the interest rate reduction will be welcome — Sinn Féin predicted some time ago that it will come — it will amount to very little when considered in the context of the profits our partners are making, the tens of billions being pumped into the banks to pay for their mistakes and the hardship being endured by our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">The ECB policy of protecting bank bondholders, whatever the monetary or social cost, makes no economic sense.  It is economic madness.  It is reckless.  The Government needs to call time on it.  The policy being implemented is leading to dangerous social consequences for our citizens.  We are seeing it everywhere.  I am sure the Taoiseach has first-hand experience of it.  The Government has chosen to retain the universal social charge and to introduce new taxes on property and water.  We are familiar with the forthcoming household charge.  Schools are losing special needs assistants.  I have referred to the plight of patients in our hospitals.  Young people are having to emigrate and almost 500,000 citizens are on the dole.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">The Taoiseach needs to impress on the other eurozone leaders that the Irish people are no longer prepared to carry the can for the gamblers and speculators in the finance and banking sectors.  To date, he has refused to listen to Sinn Féin's advice on these matters.  That is his entitlement.  Sin é.  That is his choice.  All of us have had to learn to listen to opposing voices.  The Taoiseach represents us all at this summit.  As he has testified on many occasions, Ireland is a good place.  Our people are good people.  They do not deserve to be walked over.  The Taoiseach needs to make a stand.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_905">When I spoke a number of weeks ago, before the previous European summit, I gave the Taoiseach two messages.  First, I told him that we are in the middle of a hostile negotiation.  From day one, the people we are negotiating with have acted explicitly against the interests of this country and its people.  Second, I said the Taoiseach should remind those he meets in Europe that they are not bailing us out.  We are bailing them out.  There is a net transfer from the Irish people to European financial institutions.  If that message can get through, it changes the conversation.  The Minister of State with responsibility for Europe responded to me by saying I did not understand the situation.  She started to defend Angela Merkel by saying her actions needed to be seen in the context of her political needs.  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled recently, the Minister for Finance as good as denied any knowledge of any threats by the ECB to Ireland, despite the fact that Professor Honohan went on the record and spoke about those threats on television.  It is worrying that the response of the Taoiseach's team to my last message was based on a combination of deference and denial.  Therefore, I will transmit a different message today.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The Taoiseach said in his opening address that "we need an outcome that offers certainty and security".  I do not think that can be achieved by treating debt with more debt.  Europe's failed approach has put the survival of the euro at risk.  That was inconceivable a small number of months ago.  I suggest that the Taoiseach might raise the possibility of Europe printing money, which is what the UK and the US have done.  UK exporters to Ireland have a 30% price advantage over our domestic business community as a result of this approach.  The ECB is not allowed to take such action, however, because it is required to keep inflation in Europe below 2%.  If the rules can be relaxed and we can agree to higher inflation of 5%, 6% or 7% for a few years, we will have a huge advantage.  If we print money — it is known as "quantitative easing" — we will erase debt in real terms at the sovereign level, the banking level and the personal level.  It would make Europe far more competitive as an exporting zone.  I ask the Taoiseach to bring that to the table at the summit.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_532">
          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_907">I would like to echo what my colleagues have said in wishing the Taoiseach well at tomorrow's vital summit.  I am a little concerned about the message he sent in his speech.  There seemed to be a complacency about this meeting that did not exist two days ago, before Mrs. Merkel said yesterday that Germany does not expect a sudden solution to be found on Thursday.  We need a sudden solution and we need it now.  The Taoiseach said "the crisis in the euro area will not be resolved overnight".  The Taoiseach and I know that Ireland is very close to midnight.  That is not what Mrs. Merkel is saying.  We should not doff the cap to her so often.  The markets are saying clearly that Greece is bankrupt and is going to default, that Portugal is going to default and that Ireland is going to default.  There should be no shame in defaulting if that is necessary.  No shame on our part is attached to the fact that our rogue bankers borrowed money from European banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">The Irish taxpayer must not be held to ransom in Europe tomorrow by the Taoiseach.  No concessions should be made.  We do not need what the Taoiseach carefully called "a measured debate" in here today.  We need a passionate debate which says we are going to Europe with the message that Ireland comes first.  I am distressed by the pattern that was evident again when we listened to what Mrs. Merkel had to say yesterday.  The emphasis in the Irish voice moved from a sudden and immediate emergency to a direct reflection of what Mrs. Merkel had to say.  We do not need to do that.  We are almost whistling past the graveyard at this stage.  It will not be good enough to hear the mantra or message of "we will do a little better on the interest rates" once more.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">We should bear in mind that the Minister for Finance said a few weeks ago that the interest rate does not matter very much at this stage.  He said that as an excuse at a time when he was not being very successful, but he was right.  The importance of the interest rate issue is diminishing by the day.  We should not hear about how the fund will get bigger, or how the maturities will be extended.  The problem is far greater than that.  This summit should produce results for Ireland and for Europe.  We cannot postpone it any further because the markets will not tolerate it.  The message from the markets after each of the recent big summits and each announcement has been to give the thumbs-down to Ireland, Greece and Portugal.  The bond yields have headed up after each solution because it was a fudge.  I ask the Taoiseach to take to Brussels the message that Ireland is not ashamed to advocate default in the context of a structured and agreed default within the European context.  He should emphasise that we need surgery, rather than a band aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">I repeat my earlier call for the Dáil to sit on Friday or Monday so Members have an opportunity to hear from the Taoiseach and question him about what happened at this summit, which might be the most important conference ever held in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">I do not believe in the normal cry from members of the Opposition for us to come in during the holidays, but this is the most important event that has happened in the Taoiseach's term in office and it would not be too much to ask that he comes back here and that we have an opportunity to find out what happened at that conference.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_912">Will the Taoiseach go to the EU tomorrow with a clear statement that this madness must end?  Since 2008 there have been €20 billion in cuts.  These have come in charges, levies, taxes and increased interest rates on mortgage debt all across the line, and taxes on low and moderate incomes.  This policy has enormously deepened the recession.  Demand has been cut by 25%, and yet still we have an €18 billion budget deficit.  We are not one step further on.  Austerity has not worked and it will not work, and that message must go to the leaders of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">As the Taoiseach will be aware, this country needs growth and jobs.  It needs to reduce welfare costs and increase the tax base.  Another €4 billion of austerity next year would be a disaster.  It would be a slow economic strangulation of the economy, and we cannot tolerate it.  The words, "Can't pay, won't pay," are on everybody's lips.  The Irish people cannot take anymore.  On top of this, the burden of the bank bailout is not sustainable.  Apart from being immoral and unjust, the idea that a solution will come — on which I agree with the Taoiseach — with the problems surrounding the EU on Thursday is wishful thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The EU project has run up against a simple fact.  It is still a Europe based on nation states with national interests.  French banks are most exposed to the Greek write down and state that they are in opposition to debt sharing between the banks and bondholders.  On the other hand, the German taxpayers will not swallow bailing out peripheral countries.  At the same time, we are told that we must be good boys and girls and take the cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">We need a new approach.  We need to reject the rotten IMF-ECB deal that has wrecked the economy and the health, education and social services and that is destroying lives and livelihood, and we must default.  We must call for a cancellation of the debt, along with Portugal and Greece and the other countries now being affected by the euro crisis.  It is not a crisis; we are nearly facing into an abyss at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">I put it to the Taoiseach that we must also raise with the European Union that Ireland should leave the euro if it does not accept cancellation of the debt to re-finance the State and re-inflate the economy.  On the banks, we must abandon the bailout.  These are failed entities and we must start anew, take control and ownership of our banking system and use that then to release money into the economy which is not being released now.  We must set up a new bank to deal with mortgage debt, write down the debt of mortgages and release the debt burden on people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_917">As the Taoiseach heads off to this meeting, has it dawned on him even a little that the EU, IMF and ECB simply do not have a clue what they are doing, and that the policy of bailing out the bankers and the bondholders and imposing brutal austerity on ordinary people is not only unjust but is making the crisis worse and is spreading the contagion?  Has it occurred to him — flashed on his radar screen at all — that the EU-IMF medicine is a poison that, rather than curing, threatens to kill the patient?  Has it crossed his mind that the EU, IMF and ECB do not care what happens to ordinary citizens here, working people and those with special needs, but are simply acting as the agents of the financial markets and big corporate interests which want to asset strip this country, Greece and Portugal just as they have done elsewhere?</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Does the Taoiseach know, for example, anything at all about the history of the IMF and the trail of destruction, poverty and war that it has left in its wake as it has gone in to assist countries?  Does he know, for example, that two champions of IMF austerity and privatisation programmes are General Pinochet in Chile and the not lamented former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and that the IMF policies they imposed on their countries in so-called structural adjustment devastated those countries and their people?  Does the Taoiseach want to go down in history in the company of tyrants such as Pinochet and Mubarak who imposed such brutal policies on the people of their countries?  Does it jar with the Taoiseach that as he and others in this House, and the bankers, developers and politicians who helped create and preside over this crisis, head off on their holidays, hundreds of thousands of working people here will not have any holidays and will not even know whether they can meet the bills over the summer months?  Is it not time to say the bankers and financiers who caused the crisis should pay for it and that our natural resources and the wealth in our society should be used to create jobs and protect public services and the vulnerable in our society instead of bailing out the insatiable monster that has wrecked the European economy?</p>

There are options being discussed now, for instance, in regard to Spain, as to what other facilities might be made available.  I want to see, if anything is being given of benefit in respect of the difficulty arising from Greece, that the same applies to this country.  In the absence of Deputy Ross, I can tell him that the Dáil will not sit here on Monday but he will have an opportunity to go to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and give his views.</p>

          <p eId="para_932">The discussions currently going on in terms of the agenda to be determined for tomorrow are important.  Obviously, the issues that have been put out here need decision by the eurozone leaders and as I have stated to the Dáil, I hope the process of making decisions, separate from any private sector involvement here, will demonstrate that the eurozone countries are prepared to back themselves up, particularly in regard to a country like Ireland which has met all the conditions of the austere and challenging circumstance in which we find ourselves.  From that point of view, I am keen to see a situation where decisions are made that bring to an end the concern and anxiety about a contagion spreading from Greece to other countries.  That is why the meeting is taking place now.  There is a range of issues on which, I hope, the meeting will focus in order to make decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">We have gone through the process of imposing significant burdens on subordinated bondholders.  As I said, we do not regard that book as being closed in regard to Anglo Irish Bank.  However, people should be clear on what they are arguing about.  A failure on the part of a private enterprise, even one that must be taken into public ownership as a result of chronic mismanagement, is one thing — that is part of the commercial reality in which people operate — but the situation of a country is very different.  The failure of a country to pay back what it has borrowed causes real and lasting damage to its reputation and future ability to borrow.  It causes great pain and suffering for its people who must bear the brunt of any such action.  This is something countries only do only as an absolute last resort.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">I realise several countries have been pushing hard to have the private sector share the load of the public purse in any new arrangement for Greece.  This reflects the fact that in several countries it has become increasingly difficult for the government to secure the agreement of the Parliament on what is needed by way of support from others.  I cannot inform the House what will be agreed tomorrow — nor can anyone else who intends to attend the meeting of the eurozone Heads of State — whether the private sector will play a part and, if so, to what extent.  However, I will continue to do everything possible to impress upon the leaders and partners the need to ensure what takes place does not damage this country's interests.  We are implementing our programme, working hard and delivering.  This is not the assessment of the Government but that of the IMF.  It would be a great injustice if our prospects for recovery were to suffer a setback through no fault of our own.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">Deputy Martin called for this debate yesterday.  Although I do not agree with them, there were other suggestions from Deputies not elected for any party.  Deputy Martin has stated his position clearly, as he has always done.

          <p eId="para_953">notes the publication of the report by the Commission of Investigation into the handling by Church and State authorities of allegations and suspicions of child sexual abuse against clerics of the Catholic Diocese of Cloyne;</p>
          <p eId="para_954">expresses its sympathy with the victims whose suffering is set out in the report;</p>
          <p eId="para_955">expresses its thanks to the Commission of Investigation for their work carried out with sensitivity;</p>
          <p eId="para_956">expresses its dismay at the disturbing findings of the report and at the inadequate and inappropriate response, particularly of the Church authorities in Cloyne, to complaints and allegations of child sexual abuse;</p>
          <p eId="para_957">deplores the Vatican's intervention which contributed to the undermining of the child protection frameworks and guidelines of the Irish State and the Irish bishops;</p>
          <p eId="para_958">welcomes the publication of the Children First National Guidance 2011, the full and consistent implementation of which will be given priority, and welcomes the approval by Government for the preparation of legislation to require statutory compliance with the Children First National Guidance;</p>

          <p eId="para_960">welcomes the publication of the provisions concerning the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes against Children and Vulnerable Adults) Bill 2011 and welcomes the announcement made that the heads of the National Vetting Bureau Bill 2011 will be published by the end of July 2011 and furnished to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for a consultative process; and</p>
          <p eId="para_961">affirms its determination that the State will take all necessary measures to protect its children.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">The revelations in the Cloyne report have brought the Government, Irish Catholics and the Vatican to an unprecedented juncture.  It is fair to say that after the Ryan and Murphy reports, Ireland is, perhaps, unshockable when it comes to the abuse of children.  However, the Cloyne report has proved to be of a different order because for the first time in this country a report on child sexual abuse exposes an attempt by the Holy See to frustrate an inquiry in a sovereign, democratic republic as little as three years ago, not three decades ago.  In doing so the report excavates the dysfunction, disconnection and elitism that dominate the culture of the Vatican to this day.  The rape and torture of children were down-played or managed to uphold the primacy of the institution, its power, standing and reputation.  Far from listening to evidence of humiliation and betrayal with St. Benedict's "ear of the heart", the Vatican's reaction was to parse and analyse it with the gimlet eye of a Canon lawyer.  This calculated, withering position is the polar opposite of the radicalism, humility and compassion on which the Roman Church was founded.  Such radicalism, humility and compassion comprise the essence of its foundation and purpose.  This behaviour is a case of <i>Roma locuta est: causa finita est</i>, except in this instance nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">The Cloyne report's revelations are heart-breaking.  It describes how many victims continued to live in the small towns and parishes in which they were reared and abused.  Their abuser was often still in the area and still held in high regard by their families and community.  The abusers continued to officiate at family weddings and funerals.  In one case, the abuser even officiated at a victim's wedding.  There is little that I or anyone else in the House can say to comfort that victim or others, however much we wish to.  However, we can and do recognise the bravery and courage of all the victims who told their stories to the commission.  While it will take a long time for Cloyne to recover from the horrors uncovered, it could take the victims and their families a lifetime to pick up the pieces of their shattered existence, if ever they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">One day after the publication of the report the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met the Papal Nuncio to Ireland, Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza.  The Tánaiste left the archbishop clear on two things: the gravity of the actions and attitude of the Holy See and Ireland's complete rejection and abhorrence of same.  The papal nuncio undertook to present the Cloyne report to the Vatican.  The Government now awaits the considered response of the Holy See.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">The people, including the many faithful Catholics who, like me, have been shocked and dismayed by the repeated failings of church authorities to face up to what is required.  They deserve and require confirmation from the Vatican that it does accept, endorse and require compliance by all church authorities here with the obligations to report all cases of suspected abuse, whether current or historical, to the State's authorities in line with the Children First national guidance which will have the force of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Clericalism has rendered some of Ireland's brightest and most privileged and powerful men either unwilling or unable to address the horrors cited in the Ryan and Murphy reports.  This Roman clericalism must be devastating for good priests, some of them old, others struggling to keep their humanity, even their sanity, as they work hard to be the keepers of the church's light and goodness within their parishes, communities and the condition of the human heart.  Thankfully for them and us, this is not Rome.  Nor is it industrial school or Magdalene Ireland, where the swish of a soutane, smothered conscience and humanity and the swing of a thurible ruled the Irish Catholic world.  This is the Republic of Ireland in 2011.  It is a republic of laws, rights and responsibilities and proper civic order where the delinquency and arrogance of a particular version of a particular kind of morality will no longer be tolerated or ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">As a practising Catholic, I do not say any of this easily.  Growing up, many of us in here learned that we were part of a pilgrim church.  Today, that church needs to be a penitent church, a church truly and deeply penitent for the horrors it perpetrated, hid and denied — in the name of God, but for the good of the institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">Through our legislation, through our Government's action to put children first, those who have been abused can take some small comfort in knowing that they belong to a nation — to a democracy — where humanity, power, rights and responsibilities are enshrined and enacted always for their good; where the law — their law, as citizens of this country — will always supersede canon law that has neither legitimacy nor place in the affairs of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">This report tells us a tale of a frankly brazen disregard for protecting children.  If we do not respond swiftly and appropriately as a State, we will have to prepare ourselves for more reports like this.  I agree with Archbishop Martin that the church needs to publish any other and all other reports like this as soon as possible.  I note the commission is very positive about the work of the National Board for Safeguarding Children, established by the church to oversee the operation by dioceses and religious orders.  The commission notes that all church authorities were required to sign a contract with the national board agreeing to implement the relevant standards and that those refusing to sign would be named in the board's annual report.  Progress has been in no small measure due to the commitment of Mr. Ian Elliott and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">There is some small comfort to be drawn by the people of Cloyne from the fact that the commission compliments the efforts made by the diocese since 2008 in training, in vetting personnel and in the risk management of priests against whom allegations have been made.  Nevertheless, the behaviour of Bishop Magee and Monsignor O'Callaghan show how fragile even good standards and policies are to the weakness and willful disregard of those who fail to give the right priority to safeguarding our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">If the Vatican needs to get its house in order, so too does this State.  The report of the commission is rightly critical of the entirely unsatisfactory position which the last Government allowed to persist over many years.  The unseemly bickering between the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the HSE over the statutory powers to deal with extra-familial abuse, the failure to produce legislation to enable the exchange of soft information, as promised after the Ferns inquiry, and the long period of confusion and disjointed responsibility for child protection within the HSE, as reported by the commission, are simply not acceptable to me nor in a society which values children and their safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">For too long Ireland has neglected some of its children.  Just last week, we saw a case of the torture of children within the family come before the courts.  Just two days ago, we were repulsed by the case of a Donegal registered sex offender and school caretaker, which involved children and young adults reduced to human wreckage.  This raises questions and issues of serious import for State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">We are set to embark on a course of action to ensure the State is doing all it can to safeguard our children.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is bringing forward two Bills, first, to make it an offence to withhold information relating to crimes against children and vulnerable adults, and, second, at long last, to allow for the exchange of soft information on abusers.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">As Taoiseach, I want to do all I can to protect the sacred space of childhood and to restore its innocence, especially for our young teenagers, because, regardless of our current economic crisis, our children are, and always will be, our most precious possession of all.  Safeguarding their integrity and innocence must be a national priority.  This is why I undertook to create a Cabinet ministry for Children and Youth Affairs.  The legislation, Children First, proposes to give our children maximum protection and security without intruding on the hectic, magical business of being a child.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger said: "Standards of conduct appropriate to civil society or the workings of a democracy cannot be purely and simply applied to the Church".  As the Holy See prepares its considered response to the Cloyne Report, I want to make it clear, as Taoiseach, that when it comes to the protection of the children of this State, the standards of conduct which the Church deems appropriate to itself cannot and will not be applied to the workings of democracy and civil society in this republic — not purely, or simply or otherwise, because children have to be and will be put first.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_978">It is appropriate that the motion before the House is signed by party and group leaders because the only acceptable reaction to this report is unity between us all to condemn the actions it exposes, support the victims and affirm our joint commitment to action.  The report is very moving for me because I intimately know many of the communities which have been affected by this abuse.  They are strong communities with a great spirit.  They have vibrant sports clubs and family facilities.  The Church has always played a significant role.  It has been respected and valued by both people of faith and the wider community.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">The undeniable facts in this report show a different picture of the Catholic Church in Cloyne.  Abusers were allowed to use their status as clergy to carry out the most appalling crimes and the church's leadership in the diocese and in Rome showed a callous disregard for safety and the rights of the most vulnerable members of its flock.  This was done not simply to avoid scandal.  It went much further and involved a wilful refusal to respect basic moral and legal responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">The abuse of children should never take place, but where it does, simple humanity requires swift and resolute intervention.  We do not need regulations to understand this fundamental morality.  However, a significant framework of regulation and legal sanctions has been in place for a long time.  No person within any organisation, be it public or private, has any excuse for not knowing exactly what to do when there is even a general suspicion of child abuse.  The intervention of church authorities in undermining child protection rules in recent years is nothing short of an outrage and a betrayal of those who look to them for moral leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">When the evidence of their failures were exposed, the reaction of key Church authorities has given little assurance that they understand the scale and depth of the outrage felt by ordinary people.  This is not something that can be dismissed as a plot by a secular elite against a church.  In fact, most of the strongest views I have heard come from people who have great faith in the spiritual teachings of the church.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">In my meeting last year with the papal nuncio, I made it clear that the Irish State expected the Vatican's full co-operation in the investigation into abuse in the Cloyne diocese and in all other investigations.  Its defensiveness and focus on the institutional interests of the church rather than those of the children abused by its clergy and shielded by its leaders will continue to cause great damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">We should acknowledge the stand of some church leaders, most especially Archbishop Martin.  The church will only retain a place of importance in our society if his colleagues follow him in his impressive commitment to acknowledging and addressing the failure of the church over too many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">The Ryan report exposed in great detail the systematic brutalisation and exploitation of children through many decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">It showed what is probably the darkest chapter in our history as an independent State.  Thousands of children who had the right to expect their State to protect and nurture them were abused in the most appalling ways within mostly church controlled institutions.  The report has highlighted how the problem of abuse and institutional cover-up is not only a concern of the past but is also not something anyone can be complacent about.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">The Ryan report emerged because of a brave group of survivors who many years into their adult lives were determined to get justice and support healing.  I met many of them before and after I proposed the establishment of that commission of inquiry.  I did not want to add a partisan note to the debate but I was struck by what the Taoiseach said about the previous Minister and Government.  The survivors of the Goldenbridge institutions had been refused access to the then rainbow Government and officials for several years and it was only the television documentary that gave them a profile in the public arena.  They had been denied a response from the State for many years before we proposed the establishment of that commission.  I admire very much their courage, integrity and continued commitment to many survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">I also initiated the first inquiry into abuse in a church diocese in Ferns.  Mr. George Birmingham did an outstanding job on that.  We did not expect there would be further shocking revelations from the dioceses of Dublin and Cloyne.  The significance of the Cloyne report is that many of the victims of abuse are much younger than those covered by the Ryan report and, in many cases, they are clearly only beginning to come to terms with the abuse they suffered.  It is right that we thank the commission of investigation for carrying out a difficult assignment with sensitivity and thoroughness.  I welcome the general measures proposed for dealing with what has been outlined in the report.  Our consideration of the legislation should be thorough and fast.  Equally, where there is a need for further forensic investigations, particularly in regard to other dioceses, they should be carried out.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_563">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_988">I endorse the motion and the contributions of the Taoiseach and Deputy Martin.  The motion and the report send a strong message of support to those who suffered abuse.  However, on this occasion there is an even stronger message of condemnation of those who perpetrated the abuse and the strongest message should be directed at those who covered it up in Cloyne, the Vatican and elsewhere.  They, in full knowledge of the horrendous impact of abuse arising from previous commissions of inquiries, cases and disclosures and in full knowledge of the fact that it was either happening within their own organisation or in their area, proceeded with contempt for survivors and victims, contempt for their own church and the members and colleagues who serve it and contempt, in the case of the Vatican, for the laws of an independent nation state with, ultimately, a shared contempt for the truth.  That contempt had its foundations in one aim — the protection of friends and colleagues, a protection given and offered to the cost of victims and survivors, the church and, ultimately, the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">We have been here previously.  All-party motions were tabled on the Ryan, Ferns and Murphy reports and we expressed similar sentiments then, yet we are back in the House again.  The most shocking aspect of the Cloyne report is that we are here at all.  This abuse did not happen 50 or 60 years ago in a different era.  The report covers how abuse allegations were handled between 1996 and 2009.  It explicitly states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_990">The greatest failure by the Diocese of Cloyne was its failure to report all complaints to the Gardaí.  Between 1996 and 2005, there were 15 complaints which very clearly should have been reported by the diocese to the Gardaí...Of these 15, nine were not reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">This was only 15 years ago and the report covers the period after that covered by the Ferns report.  The Ferns report, published in 2005, found that bishops at that time placed the interests of individual priests ahead of those of the community in which they served, yet this practice continued unabated in Cloyne.  The Murphy report has also shown this was also the practice in the Dublin archdiocese for a 30-year period.  This gives us three dioceses with three similar practices of cover up.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">As the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs stated last week, we cannot say with certainty that the same is not true in every other diocese.  That certainty is needed.  Victims and survivors need that certainty to get the peace they deserve.  The country needs certainty to move on and the vast majority of priests and members of the Catholic Church who were not part of this need that certainty.  It must be ensured that the HSE audit of the 24 dioceses is published in September.  The church must get its act together and finalise its audit.  Surely at this stage, given the time expended on this, it is not too much to ask that the audit be published by the end of this year.  Publication of the audits will allow us for the first time to establish the scale of abuse throughout the county and we will only then be able to say with certainty that we can begin the process of moving on.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">However, there is one caveat.  The manner in which the Vatican interfered in the Cloyne diocese is appalling and the report is direct about this.  According to the authors, the response of the Vatican to the framework document "can only be described as unsupportive especially in relation to reporting to the civil authorities. The effect was to strengthen the position of those who dissented from the official stated Irish Church policy".  Those who dissented were not interested in the protection of the children.  The response from the Vatican was in the interest of the protection of friends and colleagues at the expense of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">It is exactly one week since the publication of the report by the Government and the Vatican has yet to issue a formal response.  Its only response was through a spokesman this morning who, in a personal capacity, said there was nothing in the advice given by the nuncio in 1997 to encourage bishops to break Irish laws.  He said the Vatican's advice on child protection policies could not be interpreted as an invitation to cover up abuse.  Does the Vatican take us, the people of Ireland, for fools?  The Congregation for the Clergy of the Vatican told Irish bishops that the framework document was "not an official document of the Episcopal Conference but merely a study document.  It further stated it contained "procedures and dispositions which appear contrary to canonical discipline and which, if applied, could invalidate the acts of some Bishops who were attempting to put a stop to this problem.  If such procedures were to be followed by the Bishops and there were cases of eventual hierarchical recourse lodged at the Holy See, the results could be highly embarrassing and detrimental to those same Diocesan authorities".</p>
          <p eId="para_995">This is the most damning line.  There is no indication of any concern on the part of Vatican for the children who were abused.  While the Vatican authorities might not have encouraged bishops to break the laws, they encouraged them to put the reputation of the church before the protection of children.  They were more worried about embarrassment than the damage of abuse.  In how many other dioceses did the Vatican interfere in the manner it did in Cloyne?  We need to ascertain this to truly believe the forthcoming audits.  Will the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs consider compelling the HSE to include this in its audit because we will be unable to believe other audits unless this is included?</p>
          <p eId="para_996">The legislative response will come before the health and justice committees.  I propose that consideration be given to establishing a joint sub-committee of both committees so that spokespersons in both portfolios can be involved.  I welcome the indication that the criminal justice (withholding information on crimes against children and vulnerable adults) Bill will be introduced in September.  Given the discussion that has developed around this issue in recent days, August might be used for consultation on it so people with genuine concerns will have an opportunity to put forward their views to the justice committee in a dispassionate manner.  Heads of the legislation may be ready by the end of the month.  If so, consultation would be possible in August.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">Developments in the vetting bureau are also welcome.  I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister for Justice and Equality in addressing the backlog in the Garda vetting system.  However, unless the resources issues at the bureau are addressed, our shared ambition to introduce vetting legislation will amount to nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">We cannot again gather on another report to express our disgust and anger at what has happened.  Archbishop Martin has challenged the Catholic Church by stating it can never rest until the last abuse victim has found peace.  We, too, must put legislative building blocks in place and not rest until we have done our bit to give the victims peace.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_564">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_999">While Sinn Féin supports the motion, we would have preferred to see the stronger language contained in a previous draft employed.  The motion expresses how the House deplores the Vatican's intervention which contributed to the undermining of the child protection frameworks and guidelines of the State and Irish bishops.  Previously, the motion expressed condemnation.  We in Sinn Féin still express condemnation of this scandalous intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">The events in Cloyne documented in the report may span a considerable period, but they did not take place 100 years ago.  There was still abuse in Cloyne while preparations for the commencement of the deliberations of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children were under way.  It continued up to a couple of years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">This is a 400-page document that shows that 17 years after the Brendan Smyth debacle brought down the then Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Government in 1994, the official Catholic Church has learned nothing.  While the State has neglected its duties by failing to put mandatory reporting requirements in place earlier, in Cloyne Bishop John Magee held Canon Law superior to the civil law of the land.  That disposition directly led to the abuse of more children through not adhering to correct reporting procedures and, thereby, placed more children at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">How many inquiries do we have to go through before real action is taken on this dreadful neglect?  We have seen the Murphy, Ferns and Cloyne reports.  The Catholic Church still controls many of our schools.  As stated, this report investigates incidents which only took place a short number of years ago.  I shudder to think of the real facts, the full story.  Will more reports and inquiries on the lack of adherence to reporting protocols have to be commissioned?</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">The papal nuncio refused to answer queries from a commission of inquiry and claimed diplomatic immunity.  The same papal nuncio still has the role of issuing Vatican instructions to the bishops in this country.  I expect that if a school system operated and directly controlled by a third party state in Ireland consistently failed to report allegations of child sexual abuse against its teachers and ancillary employees to the Garda, that state's ambassador would be required to answer questions.  If he or she failed to do so, he or she would be asked to leave.  The church is not above the law and it is high time it stopped thinking it was.  Fr. Federico Lombardi may claim his recent remarks were made in a personal capacity, but this is the disingenuous double-speak that must come to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">Bishop John Magee had no interest in protecting the children of Cloyne and fobbed off his responsibility to Monsignor Denis O'Callaghan who equally had no interest in reporting the abuse of children to the authorities.  Bishop John Magee actively and knowingly lied to the Government, the health service and the Garda.  He concealed information on the crimes committed by the priests in his diocese.  He actively engaged in the reckless and, at times, wilful endangerment of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">There are prosecutions to be faced by those who perpetrated crimes against children, either through directly abusing them or being complicit in the cover-up of their abuse.  Nothing less, I fear, will bring to an end this lurid regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Two thirds of complaints made between 1996 and 2008 were not reported to the Garda and no complaint was passed to the Health Service Executive during this period.  While Members of this House, including the current Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Justice and Equality, were sitting in a committee room deliberating on the rights of children, Bishop John Magee was still not reporting allegations of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">The cardinals may have apologised for this report, but that is not good enough.  The official church has disgraced itself in the handling of this most serious of issues.  It is absolutely disgusting and goes right to the top.  The bishops, with the Vatican, played a major role in aggravating the level of abuse of children in Ireland.  The Cloyne report, measured in its tone, has found the Vatican's reaction to the 1996 framework document was "entirely unhelpful" to any bishop who wanted to implement it, while giving any bishop the individual freedom to ignore it.  We now need cast-iron guarantees from the church authorities that they will adhere to the civil law when it comes to the mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse when it is introduced with immediate effect.  They have a moral obligation to do so.  However, moral obligations on members of the clergy in Cloyne have not worked well in the past.  Accordingly, we also need cast-iron guarantees from the State that if any more flagrant breaches of the law which we have seen on many occasions in the past must be held to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">For the Vatican to state the framework document of 1997 was merely a study document rather than an official document was nothing short of an insult to the survivors and victims of abuse.  It stated it had "serious reservations of a moral and canonical nature" about the document.  It is now up to it to state exactly what it meant by having moral reservations about reporting allegations of abuse or the actual knowledge that some Cloyne clerics were child molesters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">The Vatican, through the papal nuncio, refused to explain to the commission of inquiry in 2005 why the updated guidelines were not recognised officially by the church.  Monsignor Denis O'Callaghan actively obstructed the implementation of these guidelines in Cloyne.  It is this complete and unreserved disregard that some senior voices in the church have for child protection in this case that is hard to stomach.  There have now been three statutory inquiries into abuse in church dioceses in Ireland in which child protection procedures were found wanting.  Will there be more?</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">Only in 2009 Cardinal Seán Brady said Bishop John Magee was "dependable and reliable" and that he did not need to resign.  This was a man who had been found by the church's own national board for safeguarding children to be presiding over practices that were both inadequate and actually dangerous.  It is a scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">Many have said we can learn from all of these reports.  It is hard to see how so many reports highlighting similar failures can all have different lessons from which we can learn.  In looking at the lessons of the Cloyne report, will the Minister agree we can teach others?  Last December the Executive in the Six Counties announced the setting up of an inquiry into historical institutional abuse in the North.  A cross-departmental working group set up to examine how an inquiry would proceed reported to the Executive almost a fortnight ago.  A decision will be made on how to investigate crimes committed in institutions, those run by the Catholic Church and State-run institutions, in the autumn.  The Minister will also be aware that several dioceses, including Raphoe, Derry, Clogher and Armagh, stretch across the Border.  In looking at possible future inquiries in other dioceses, it may be useful to co-ordinate with the initiative under way in the Six Counties.  Members of the Northern Executive may also benefit from the experience of Members, victims groups and wider civil society as to how the inquiries into abuse in the Twenty-six Counties have been handled.  Several meetings with individuals have taken place.  We may benefit from having a more structured or formal approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">If the Vatican has demonstrated contempt and disregard for the concerns of the State and the abuse investigations, it is only in keeping with the arrogance with which it approaches the mechanisms for the protection of international human rights.  The Vatican was due to submit its second report under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1997.  Fourteen years on, it still has not done so.  It was supposed to submit its first report under the UN Convention against Torture in 2003.  Eight years on, it still has not done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">In countries and continents across the world the Catholic Church, acting as a religious organisation when it suits its interests and as a state with all the protections that entails when it suits, has covered up the abuse and torture of hundreds of thousands of innocent children and young people.  While many of these cases may have occurred in the past, the cover-ups are taking place today.  The determination to avoid accountability is therefore today's crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">As a candidate country for the United Nations Human Rights Council and one struggling to deal with the legacies of generations of abuse, Ireland should be able to show leadership on the international stage by calling on the Vatican to stop acting like a rogue state and live up to the commitments it has made by signing and ratifying binding international human rights treaties.  As a Catholic, it is my strong belief that my church should not be a reluctant convert to the protection of human rights and children.  Surely it should be in the global vanguard in respect of these issues.  That it is not saddens and offends.  This must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">The Vatican has behaved disgracefully.  Its ambiguous nature, claiming to be a state and expecting to be treated thus internationally but without the burden of its agents having to adhere to national laws in other states, has meant it has received preferential treatment under a succession of Irish Governments.  The persistent attitude of acting solely in the interests of self-protection is fundamentally anti-Christian.  It is sad to note there is a real likelihood that those who for so long have been ordained with this doctrine of complicity and silence will not easily abandon such habits.  That said, it is important to reflect that there are many good priests in all dioceses of the Catholic Church.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">When Israel compromised Irish passports it was taken to task.  Hundreds of children and young people have been raped and abused by members of an institution controlled by the Vatican.  Their actions led to the amplification of the devastating emotional and psychological consequences of abuse.  Are we to truly believe this is a matter of just a few bad eggs?  It is striking that the Cloyne report found there were concerns raised about almost 8% of the 163 priests serving in the diocese in 1996.  It is ten years since the State's official apology for its role in abuse yet the response by the relevant authorities in the report was demonstrably wholly inadequate.  The church failed to uphold child protection procedures and repeatedly failed to report complaints to the Garda.  Meanwhile, the Garda failed to fully investigate complaints.  The State must apologise again to the victims of abuse for its failings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">The report details one case where, despite Garda assurances, the commission found no evidence of police investigations into allegations by two women against a single priest.  The commission stated it was concerned and does not accept there was a proper investigation into the complaints against the priest named as Father Corin.  I welcome the joint statement issued by the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Children and Youth Affairs on the publication of the report wherein they express "profound sorrow" regarding the failures of the State.  While this motion may be about Cloyne, the State still has questions to answer regarding its procedures.  There is an overwhelming sense of <i>déjà vu</i> with all of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Only this week, as Deputies are aware, we heard of a case in County Donegal where the owners of a school premises continued to employ a man convicted of sexually assaulting a young male despite the Garda expressing concern about the matter.  I am informed that the owner of the school was in court when the individual in question was convicted on a litany of sample rape and abuse charges, including the making of child pornography.  The head of the school stated the keys of the building were taken from him when the school authorities learned of his conviction.  Despite this, the individual in question continued to do odd jobs around the school premises.  Michael Ferry should never have been allowed to set foot inside the walls of a school or any premises that catered to the needs of children and young adults ever again.  How many other similar cases are there across this country?  Either way, this case shows a wretched failure of procedure within the school in question and demonstrates the need for the Government to bring forward the publication of the national vetting bureau Bill and establish the long awaited child welfare and protection agency.  I ask the Government to resource these bodies accordingly and ensure they are effective and capable of carrying out their responsibilities.  Procedures, as we have seen <i>ad nauseam</i>, are of no use unless implemented.  I wish the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Children and Youth Affairs well in ensuring these measures are put in place at the earliest opportunity.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Halligan</from>
          <p eId="para_1019">I will share time with Deputies Catherine Murphy, Maureen O'Sullivan, Wallace and Boyd Barrett.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">I was horrified and sickened to read the findings of the Cloyne report.  That abuse was not reported in the Diocese of Cloyne is utterly reprehensible.  I call on the Government to break off diplomatic relations with a state that, at its worst, shields paedophiles.  The papal nuncio should be expelled without delay due to the Vatican's massive deceit, the office of papal nuncio stripped of the title of Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and our ambassador immediately withdrawn from the Vatican.  If any foreign government conspired with Irish citizens to break the law here, the ambassador of the country in question would be expelled.  In this case, the Vatican, a sovereign state, has refused to co-operate with the investigation into a criminal conspiracy against children here.  It instructed our citizens, who are its priests and bishops, not to comply with Irish law and our law was broken as a result.  We would not tolerate such behaviour by any other government or state.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">Ireland has a legitimate claim that the Vatican State has breached the legal principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states.  The Holy See is party to various conventions, including the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, which requires that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1022">Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State.  They also have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">The Holy See has conducted itself in a manner which belies any special relationship between it and the Irish State and it must now be held accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">Earlier this month, the Vatican went to great lengths to make its new financial watchdog agency more independent and ensure all Vatican financial transactions comply with European Union and international anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws.  What about the criminals who inflicted such terrible suffering on children here?  Surely the violation of children and sheltering of abuse perpetrators by the church should take precedence over suspicious financial transactions.  I urge the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to use every channel available to challenge the failure of the Vatican State to report on its compliance as a party under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child since 1997 and the United Convention against Torture since 2003.  I draw the Tanaiste's attention to Articles 6 and 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the failure of the Holy See to ensure on its part, in conjunction with Irish authorities, that all cases of sexual abuse are reported.  Furthermore, a clear statement as to the primacy of the convention over canon law is required.  I urge the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to set a timeframe for a response from the Vatican without delay and, once received, to place such response before the Dáil.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_566">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_1025">I was angry on reading the Cloyne report, mainly because it shows that the culture has not changed for many senior figures in the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland.  It takes great courage to come forward to give testimony and I applaud those who did so.  For years they were not believed, fobbed off and treated as though they were in a confessional, which was wrong.  The law of the State, it appears, was subverted in favour of the Vatican.  For too long in this country we have outsourced sexual morality to the Roman Catholic Church.  It was an institution that was placed in a privileged position.  What is really horrific about the report is that even after all the revelations there were people within the church who still did not get it.  The culture of protection is still alive in the church, and many are still in denial.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I am not religious myself, however, I have watched the way Archbishop Dermot Martin has been sidelined on the issue.  He is one of the few who have given me any confidence that the protection of children is an absolute and there must be no ifs, buts or maybes.  That is the approach he has taken.  His obvious alienation sends out the most appalling message, namely, that those who question his approach are more likely to take the approach of Monsignor O'Callaghan, who said "Why should we take it on ourselves to report when the complainant does not want it done".  I do not know how he could have failed to understand that the requirement was there to protect other children.  He seems to have been completely trusted by Bishop Magee, who on page 6 of the report said he was shocked to discover in 2008 that the framework document was not being implemented.  After all that has been revealed in recent years, how could Bishop Magee detach himself in that way?</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">On page 24 of the report we are told that Bishop Magee sent out a circular in 2003 which heralded a series of meetings to be held for all priests of the diocese to discuss the persistent crisis in the church in regard to child sexual abuse.  It is even more outrageous that he did not supervise those he appointed to act on his behalf when complaints were made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">I welcome the announcement that a statutory reporting requirement will include a legal duty on State agencies to share relevant information and co-operate in the best interests of the child.  After all, it is the responsibility of the State to ensure systems are in place that are capable of handling complaints in a comprehensive manner.  I am not at all confident the system is sufficiently robust.  Social workers have complained that they are being blamed although there are not enough of them in place to deal with matters that arise.  I am also appalled by the complaints being made about how people are being treated in the lower courts.  I hope the issue will be addressed in the context of the Cloyne report.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_567">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_1029">I am struck that this time last week we were discussing residential institutions redress which was about the institutional abuse of children.  I described it as one of the darkest moments in our history.  This week we have the report into the Catholic diocese of Cloyne, which accentuates further that darkness.  What is it about the institutions in this country — the church and the State — that they have this ability to treat children and young people so cruelly either in carrying out abuse or allowing it to continue?  Other nations have had their dark moments: the Jewish nation has had the Holocaust and Cambodia has its "Killing Fields".  We have had the systematic abuse of young people — abuse that is sexual, physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual — carried out by those in authority in the church, the State and within families.  While we may not have had the death toll involved in those other disasters there is a part of every young person that dies when they are abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">It is noted in the report that there were reservations about some priests while in training.  They were obviously attracted to the position because it gave them such scope when it came to abuse.  The concern for the welfare of the abuser above that of the abused, as one victim put it, and damage limitation rather than a genuine wish to help unreservedly was evident.  When the church did have clear guidelines in place on the duty to report to the Garda and the health authorities that was not done.  Inadequate records were kept and the tendency was to keep the complaint within the church.  I acknowledge that at times the complaints were handled properly.  Again, we acknowledge the complainants who came forward to give evidence.  It is harrowing to read their statements.  We also note the reference to the Vatican in the report.  There is widespread sexual abuse of young people by clerics not just in this country but in America and other countries with horrific effects.  It is equally heartbreaking for those in religious life who are as appalled as we are by what was done by other people of the cloth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">The Cloyne report stated: "The standards which were adopted by the church are high standards which if fully implemented would afford proper protection to children."  The key word is "implement".  It continues to say that the standards set by the State are less precise and more difficult to implement so the State cannot afford to take the high moral ground when cases are being investigated concerning 200 young people who died in State care.  The Donegal report has emerged this week and last week there was the case of a family who was abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">I welcome that the proposed Bill also includes crimes against intellectually disabled persons, the national vetting bureau and Children First guidelines.  We have all the measures now, but I agree with the Ombudsman for Children that we must have the resources to match.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_568">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_1033">I agree that the Government is correct to be critical of the Vatican but I regret the change of wording from the original text.  The word "condemn" has been downgraded to "deplore".  The dictionary definition of condemn is to declare to be reprehensible, wrong or evil usually after weighing evidence and without reservation, whereas deplore means to feel or express grief, to regret strongly, to consider unfortunate or deserving of deprecation.  I much prefer the use of condemn in this situation.  There is no excuse for the behaviour of the Vatican.  I am not in favour of expelling the papal nuncio simply because it is more important to keep the lines of communication open rather than out of respect, as the Vatican has been deplorable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">The Government must reassess the church-State relationship.  The church has played too big a part in the fabric of the State.  The sooner they are divided the better for both parties.  The Government should focus on the conduct of State officials and Departments in this case such as the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs which is strongly criticised in the report:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1035">The Commission found it interesting to contrast the investigations carried out by the HSE and that of Mr. Elliott on behalf of the National Board for Safeguarding Children in relation to this case.  Both investigations had access to the same material.  While the HSE dealt only with the question of the failure to report to it, Mr. Elliott took a much more robust approach to the inadequacies as he perceived them of the diocesan approach.  In the Commission's view, the National Board for Safeguarding Children and Mr. Elliott are to be commended for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">At the same time the Office of the Minister for Children was overly and unnecessarily concerned about the delivery of the Elliott report to it in July 2008.  When Mr. Elliott sent the report to the office, officials seemed to be more eager for it to go to the HSE.  The Minister seemed to be eager to absolve himself of any influence or responsibility in the area.  It would be interesting to get answers on why that was the case.  The commission makes it clear that the official who asked Mr. Elliott to withdraw his report, redraft it in a nicer way and softer manner and send it to the HSE was more concerned with protecting the Minister from involvement than dealing with the serious issue of concern, namely, the clear and certain knowledge of the failure of the diocese of Cloyne to implement child protection guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">The terms of reference of the Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin required the Minister for Health and Children to refer any Catholic diocese which was not compliant with either the recommendations of the Ferns report or church guidelines on child protection to the commission for investigation.  It was not the responsibility of the HSE or Ian Elliott, it was the responsibility of the Minister, who along with his officials appeared to have wanted to avoid it at any cost.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_569">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_1038">The pain and suffering of people who have been victims of abuse by church institutions is just too horrific to describe.  In that context the catalogue of abuse, and cover-up by the church authorities of it, and failure to act is an absolute outrage.  While this motion constitutes a good start in being so critical of the church authorities, Members must go considerably further.  First, as Deputy Halligan stated, the papal nuncio undoubtedly should be expelled until the church issues a clear and unequivocal statement that it will give precedence to civil law, that is, the law of the State, on these matters over canon law or its own concerns to defend its reputation or any other self-interest it may have.  In addition, the church and the State should be forced into some form of truth and reconciliation forum in which the victims of abuse by the church and other institutions within the State should be given the opportunity to confront the authorities of the institutions that abused them, to have their own voices heard and to articulate their demands on what they need in respect of redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">While the church authorities have, rightly, been criticised, the Minister also must consider the issue of the failure of the Garda to report complaints of abuse to the health boards, as well as the fact that in some cases, gardaí were assessing whether priests about whom complaints had been made were an ongoing risk to children.  The Garda has no qualification to assess whether alleged abusers are an ongoing risk to children as that is a matter for the health authorities.  The role of the Garda is to use different criteria to assess whether legal prosecutions can be taken.  In other words, when one talks of mandatory reporting, the key question is to what authority is one reporting and for what purpose.  Reporting should not be to the Garda alone, as I heard the Minister mention on radio today, although it certainly should be reported to.  Reporting also must be to the health authorities, which must consider the interests of the child.  Consideration must be given to whether a legal prosecution can be taken and to the best interests of the child, as well as to what measures must be put in place to secure those best interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">As has been agreed and as the wording of the motion suggests, many of these problems would not have occurred had the Children First guidelines been in place, had they been implemented fully by all agencies and bodies and had they been respected by church institutions and everyone else.  Therefore, I greatly welcome the Government's commitment to put in place and give legislative force to the Children First guidelines.  However, it is clear these guidelines cannot be implemented fully and properly unless the resources are provided to so do.  This goes far beyond the commitment to an additional 250 social workers, as many other types of supports, resources and staffing issues also must be addressed.  This comes at a time at which the public sector recruitment embargo is slaughtering staff numbers in many of the areas which it would be necessary to resource fully and this point must be considered.  If children are to come first, the resources must be put in place to ensure they do.</p>

            <p eId="para_1043">The Government is committed to tackling Ireland's economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced and that recognises the need for social solidarity.  The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department will be considered in the context of budget 2012 and subsequent budgets.  This consideration will be informed by the commitment in the programme for Government to maintain social welfare rates.  However, sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for future economic stability and growth, as well as being a prerequisite for maintaining and developing our social protection system.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  The Government believes it is appropriate, to enhance international credibility, to stick to the aggregate adjustment as set out in the national recovery plan for the combined period of 2011 and 2012.  Accordingly, there will be an ongoing requirement to curtail expenditure in 2012 and in later years.  This is necessary for many reasons, not least so that the State can continue to make social welfare payments at appropriate levels, sustaining social cohesion and treating people with dignity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">The priority of the Government is to get the economy moving, restore confidence, fix the banking system and support the protection and creation of jobs.  The success of its economic plans will lay the foundation for the rest of its agenda for change.  The jobs initiative is the first step in its recovery strategy and includes a number of initiatives that will be administered by my Department, including the recently-announced internship scheme, JobBridge.  In addition, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the halving of the lower rate of employer PRSI, thereby making it cheaper for employers to take on and retain workers and thereby reduce unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">There are considerable challenges ahead including the need to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by my Department.  This process will be informed by the comprehensive review of expenditure currently under way in all Departments and Government agencies, with the key decisions being made in the context of framing the budget for 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1046">I thank the Minister for her initial response.  While I acknowledge I have asked this question in the past, I do so in the context of more recent developments such as last week's cut in fuel allowances and so on.  The question also arises in the context of the statement made by the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, on the Government's 100th day in office when he stated categorically that welfare rates would not be cut, as per the commitment in the programme for Government.  When asked previously, the Minister stated that while she could not necessarily stand over that commitment, she would do what she could for it.  Only last week at a meeting of the Select Sub-Committee on Social Protection, she spoke of the efforts being made to make further savings in respect of anti-fraud measures——</p>

            <p eId="para_1048">It is envisaged that only €50 million will be available in that regard over and above what was saved last year.  This is what an official stated in the Minister's presence in response to an answer last week.  Where does this sit in respect of the commitment made in the programme for Government or in respect of the Tánaiste's statement?  Where does it sit in respect of the statement by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, who also entered the debate some weeks ago, to the effect that the Government would protect rates as far as possible?  Does it remain the case that rates cannot be guaranteed as per the commitment in the programme for Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_1049">My Department, in common with every other Department, is engaged in the comprehensive review of expenditure.  Budgetary decisions will be made in the context of that review and in the context of the budget for 2012.  As I have stated to the Deputy previously and as he will appreciate, I am not in a position to make statements or announcements on budget 2012 or in respect of the comprehensive review, given it is under way at present.  However, I point to two issues.  The Deputy referred to reductions in respect of certain elements of the household benefits package.  One legacy issue from the previous Government relates to certain indicative savings, as I discussed in this Chamber during Question Time previously, pertaining to social welfare which included savings in the household budget scheme.  Those commitments related to 2011, but they had not been published.  They had not all been identified by the previous Government, but the indicative headings had been.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">I have a problem with the second legacy issue arising from the period in office of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.  In its budget plan for this year it made provision for an unemployment job seekers' figure of 405,000, which is way out of line with the actual average figure, 445,000. There are attendant pressures.  The decision taken last week was very difficult.  However, as I said this morning at the committee meeting, there have been savings; for example, the Department no longer pays for the rental of telephone handsets from Eircom for which it was paying a significant amount of money.  A discount has been achieved and the service has not been altered for individuals, but there has been a saving to the Department.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1052">My Department will spend over €530 million in 2011 on the fuel scheme and the telephone, gas and electricity elements of the household benefits package which will benefit over 630,000 people.  Difficult decisions have had to be made in the light of commitments made by the previous Government.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to reconsider the changes to the fuel allowance and household benefits package announced last week.  From September, the fuel allowance is to be standardised at €20 per week, the current rate for the majority of customers, with no additional allowance payable to those living in a smokeless fuel area.  The cost of the telephone allowance will be reduced following negotiations with Eircom which will ensure customers will receive €26.86 of value on their bills, at a cost to the State of €22.22 per month.  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance scheme will be reduced to the level at the start of 2007 from 2,400 units to 1,800 per month.   These three measures will generate savings of €17 million in 2011 and €65 million annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">While we have had to implement these measures, the House should be aware that the savings were provided for last December in budget 2011 but were not specified or announced by the Government at the time.  While, of course, we want to protect the basic social welfare payments which have very positive economic and social effects, regrettably there is an ongoing necessity to achieve savings owing to our commitments with the IMF-EU-ECB troika.  There will be an ongoing necessity to curtail overall expenditure in 2012 and later years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">Energy poverty is a factor of income, energy prices and the thermal efficiency of the home.  The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to reduce their consumption of energy through improving the thermal efficiency of the home.  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are working towards this end.</p>

            <p eId="para_1055">The Minister's reply contains an amount of information but an amount of information is not contained in it.  The Minister states €530 million will be expended this year, while the Estimates suggest a figure of €395 million; this is without taking into account the cut of €17 million which the Minister did not announce to the committee last week when we dealt with the issue.  This is a time of rising prices and the Minister is cutting gas and electricity allowances by 20% and 25%, respectively, for pensioners in the main.  In attempting to defend these indefensible cuts in recent days the Minister has repeatedly argued that 21% of those in receipt of the household benefits package do not use all the units included in the allowance.  Will she acknowledge that neither she nor the Department knows anything about the circumstances of these 21% of recipients or, in fact, in many instances, the circumstances of the remaining 79%?  Will she admit she does not know who they are, whether they are the ones sitting in the dark and the cold, scrimping and scraping and afraid to turn on the light and use up their allowance in case they exceed it?  This is especially pertinent, given the recent hard winters we have endured.  Many of them may be in hospital or even on holidays abroad, but we do not know.  The Minister is basing a cut on the 21% on whom she has no information as a result of which the remaining 79% of recipients who exhaust their full fuel allowance will now be hit by a 25% cut.</p>

            <p eId="para_1056">In reply to the Deputy's first point and his justified concern about the rise in energy prices my Department supplies a number of units, in this case, 1,800.  If the energy price changes and is increased, the Department will cover this increase.  I reassure those in receipt of energy units under the household scheme that any rise in the cost of the units is covered by my Department.  If there are exceptional needs, community welfare officers can provide additional specific exceptional needs payments for those who may have specific additional needs.  I have also said that should there be a third bad or very cold winter — I hope this will not happen — I will be open to considering, as was done by the previous Government last year, additional payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">Total fuel allowance payments amount to €228 million, while the amount for electricity, telephone, TV licence and gas allowance payments comes to €367 million.  The free travel allowance is a separate allowance and not under discussion, but the total amount comes to €74 million.  I do not know from where the Deputy got his figures.  Perhaps we might compare them.  It may be that they relate to people in receipt of allowances as opposed to those in receipt of benefits who may be counted separately in a different part of the volume.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_579" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1059">The presumption underpinning this question appears to be that, by enabling people within five years of retirement to reduce their employment and, presumably, have their income supplemented by the State, unemployed people will benefit from such an arrangement.  Apart from the budgetary implications attaching to such an arrangement, there is no guarantee that job creation would result from such measures.  In fact, recent research on intergenerational solidarity by the OECD demonstrates that the rate of employment of younger people has no relationship with the rate of employment of older people.  The OECD states, "the idea that public policy can re-shuffle a fixed number of jobs between workers of different ages is simply not true in anything but the very short-term".</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">The critical factor is that if we are to deliver on our social contract to those in retirement, we need people to remain in work for as long as possible in order that we can deliver the supports necessary on retirement.  In this context, the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  The population share of those aged 65 years and over is expected to more than double between now and 2050, from 11% to 26%.  Thankfully, people are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in future, up to 88 years for women and 83.9 for men.  In contrast, the share of the working age population is projected to decline gradually from 68% to 58%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two workers to one pensioner by the middle of the century.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">Spending on public pensions, that is social welfare pensions and public service occupational pensions, is projected to increase from approximately 5.5% of GDP in 2008, to almost 15% by 2050.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">For these reasons, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of State pension age at 66.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">The introduction of a scheme which encouraged reduced participation in the labour market for older workers would, therefore, be inconsistent with the interaction of current working age and pensions policy.  In regard to occupational pension schemes, the trust deed and/or scheme rules will determine the retirement date for such schemes.  Any change to these provisions would be a matter for the pension scheme trustees and/or employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">Regarding assisting those on the live register to secure employment, the Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  These measures are consistent with efforts being made to encourage and facilitate people to continue to work up to and beyond pension age.</p>

            <p eId="para_1067">I originally submitted this question to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and it has been transferred to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  The question has also been reworded.  As there are approximately 450,000 unemployed people we need to promptly introduce some jobs initiatives.  I proposed to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that we should sponsor a programme across the private and public sectors whereby employees who are within five years of their normal retirement date could, with the approval of their employer, job-share with a person on a fixed-term contract.  The scheme should be attractive to a person agreeing to a job-share arrangement for a specific number of years within the five-year period.  Therefore the person opting to work should have each job-sharing year counted as a full year for pension purposes, whereas the person on the fixed-term contract, while not having pension contributions made for him or her by the employer would have the benefit of getting off the unemployment register and entering the workforce where he or she can develop and acquire new skills.</p>

            <p eId="para_1069">The Minister said some people would not avail of the scheme because of the age difference; it would not be relevant.  In principle the scheme should be workable.  Graduates coming from college cannot get to develop what they have and are losing what they acquired in education.  It is very demoralising for these people and I believe many would avail of such a scheme which would allow them to go into semi-retirement and take up other recreations and so on.</p>

            <p eId="para_1070">I thank the Deputy for the question.  He indicated he had submitted a proposal to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  I would also be very happy to receive the submission.  There is an issue of balancing.  Many older people wish and need to work longer to build up their pension entitlements for when they are retired, particularly women who might have been out of the labour force because they were on family duties during part of their working years.  Some older people may wish to reduce the number of hours they work, but there are also older people who definitely want to stay working.  The Polish Presidency of the EU has been holding a number of discussions on the issue.  There is no absolute link between older people retiring and those jobs being made available and created for younger people.  In some cases the jobs may simply be suppressed entirely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">I understand the Deputy's motivation and perhaps the watchword is to try to produce a flexible system for what people may wish to do as they approach retirement.  Up to approximately 2007, there was a pre-retirement payment that was abolished by the previous Government in 2007.  That payment recognised that people who left work at a certain age were unlikely to resume working again or perhaps for health or other reasons did not.  I understand and share the Deputy's concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">Regarding jobs for young people, we have just created the national internship scheme, which is designed to do some of what the Deputy is suggesting.  We are beginning to roll it out and seeing the first people getting six and nine-month internships with employers in a variety of occupations throughout the country.  I would be delighted to receive the Deputy's submission and I share his concerns.  However, I am not sure it is possible to match older retiring workers exactly with younger people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1074">I am satisfied that there are sufficient supports in place to help people with their electricity, fuel and other utility bills.  Energy poverty is a factor of income, energy prices and the thermal efficiency of the home.  The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to improve the thermal efficiency of the home.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has administered an energy efficiency programme for privately-owned low-income households, the warmer homes initiative, since 2001.  More than 65,000 such households have benefited to date, with a further 15,000 expected to receive energy efficiency upgrades this year.  A similar upgrade programme is also in place for social housing with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government supporting local authorities to improve the energy efficiency of older social housing stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">On income supports, my Department assists low-income households with their energy costs through their basic payments, through the means-tested fuel allowance scheme and the household benefits package.  The fuel allowance of €20 per week is paid to people who are dependent on long-term social welfare and unable to provide for their own heating needs.  It is paid for 32 weeks, from late September to the end of April.  The household benefits package, comprising telephone and electricity or gas allowance, as well a free television licence, is available for all those aged 70 or over; those in receipt of carers allowance; those who are 66 to 70 and in receipt of a qualifying payment and generally living alone; and those aged under 66 and in receipt of a disability or caring related payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">Under the Department's supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs because of ill health or infirmity.  In addition, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">Unfortunately, because of commitments made by the previous Government it was necessary last week that the Government approve changes to the fuel, telephone and electricity or gas allowances which will generate savings of €17 million in 2011 and €65 million annually.  While this Government has had to implement these measures, the House should be aware that these savings were provided for last December in budget 2011 but were not specified or announced by the Government at that time.  While we want to protect the basic social welfare payments which have very positive economic and social effects, regrettably there is an ongoing necessity to achieve savings due to our commitments with the IMF, EU and ECB Troika.</p>

            <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_1079">I still believe last week's measures will have a detrimental effect on many vulnerable people.  In her earlier response pertaining to the issue I refrained from asking a second supplementary question, because I wanted to put this question in context further to the answer just given.  The Minister mentioned in her earlier response that this was a legacy issue upon which the Government was forced to act and the Tánaiste said the same thing in the Chamber last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">Is it not a fact that the previous Minister met providers and other stakeholders to secure a better deal on electricity and communications elements of the household benefits package, which would have been a win-win situation?  As the Minister said, we are paying approximately €500 million per annum in guaranteed payments and it was not unreasonable to seek a discount of approximately 10% which would have resulted in savings for the Exchequer but would not have affected the package of benefits.  This is even documented on page 24 of the budget brief for 2011 from the Department of Social Protection.  In the context of those savings being sought, which were not pursued by the Minister or her officials on the Minister assuming office — she took the soft option of informing the House it was a legacy issue — is the Minister willing to confirm that the previous Government at no time proposed the reduction in the free electricity units and had instead proposed a reduction similar to the Eircom reduction to be negotiated with the electricity suppliers?</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_586" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">

            <p eId="para_1081">In the 2011 budget, the previous Government included indicative headings of savings that it did not announce or, in some cases, specify.  I have advised the Deputy of this fact previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">The Department is a major purchaser of utility services.  Upon becoming Minister, I was surprised to learn that the Department did not get much in the way of discounts.  The change to the telephone allowance is effectively a discount, with free rental of telephones provided by Eircom.  The previous Minister may have been affected by this problem and I do not know whether he entered into negotiations.  The nub of the problem seems to be that, according to the advice of the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Department of Social Protection does not have the right to go to the market to procure electricity as it is not the customer in the first instance and, therefore, has no entitlement to approach the market.  To make matters even better, the Competition Authority stated that it is more important than ever that any scheme administered by the Department should not favour one electricity supplier over another.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">I am obtaining legal advice on this matter.  I do not know whether the previous Minister did so.  Effectively, the current advice means that, although the Department is spending more than €500 million purchasing gas, electricity and other utilities for its clients, we have no right to get bulk discounts.  I am confident that previous Ministers must have been aware of this feature of competition law, but we may need to change that law.</p>

            the criteria by which placements offered by organisations in the national internship scheme are judged appropriate and posted to the JobBridge website; her views on introducing a clear set of rules that must be adhered to by all organisations providing internships in order for them to avail of free labour; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_598" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1096">The objective of JobBridge, the national internship scheme, is to assist individuals to bridge the gap between unemployment and the world of work.  It will provide those seeking employment with an opportunity to undertake a six or nine-month internship in a host organisation.  Participants will benefit from learning new skills to complement their existing skills.  Participation on the scheme will assist in breaking the cycle of unemployed people being unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers whose existing skills will not be appropriate to the types of jobs that will emerge in post-recession Ireland.  On completing their internships, participants will have improved their prospects of securing employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">A host organisation participating in JobBridge must be in a position to provide a substantial commitment to its intern to ensure the provision of a quality internship.  To this end, a clear set of rules has been developed to protect the intern and safeguard JobBridge from potential abuse.  In addition, potential host organisations can avail of the JobBridge guidelines, toolkit and other helpful facilities available on the JobBridge website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">In order for an application from a host organisation to be put up on the JobBridge site, it must meet a number of criteria.  The placement must not allow the intern to work unsupervised, he or she should accrue significant experience throughout the entire placement and an internship will not be approved where, in the absence of the intern, the organisation would need to recruit an employee to carry out the tasks identified in the internship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">Following this application process, in order for an internship to commence, a standard internship agreement must be signed by the intern and the host organisation.  It specifies a number of conditions, including the number of hours worked, rest breaks and so on.  To ensure compliance with the scheme, the Department of Social Protection and the employment services division of FÁS, which is operating the scheme with my Department under the national employment and entitlements service, are monitoring internships to ensure they are of sufficient quality and that both host organisations and interns are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">In this regard, each host organisation will be required to submit monthly compliance reports verifying that the internship is proceeding as set out in the standard internship agreement.  The employment services division of FÁS will also undertake random site visits of internships as part of this process.  In addition, a whistleblowing feature has been introduced whereby any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme's criteria may contact the national call centre.  All such claims will be investigated.  The control mechanisms and conditions have been put in place to protect the integrity of the scheme and to ensure the intern and host organisation both benefit from the arrangement.</p>

Such a person would replace someone who should have a job.  Given that the State is paying all the money, the employer is getting someone to drive his forklift for nothing.  Another advertisement was for someone to help a gardener weed.  That helper will replace a labourer and will not learn much from weeding flowers.</p>

Should this not be a compulsory condition rather than a general guideline imposed on participating organisations, given that the entire scheme is paid for by the State?</p>

            <p eId="para_1107">I thank Deputy Wallace and other Deputies who are following the website and closely monitoring the positions on offer.  Their efforts are important and I have a number of volunteers, departmental staff and people in the labour services side of FÁS doing likewise.  Some 1,100 opportunities are available on the JobBridge website.  Given their range, the Deputy will agree that many of them are good and there has been a significant number of expressions of interest in them from people wishing to become interns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">I recognise what the Deputy is saying.  In some situations, people might try to migrate an ordinary job, one that is not an internship experience as most people would understand it, on to the website.  I do not have the exact figures, but approximately 30 or 40 such advertisements have been taken down from the website.  We must continually monitor the site to try to ensure the quality of job offerings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">The Deputy asked why the regulations were not more specific.  We are trying to provide a general template for a range of different internship opportunities without being so restrictive as to prevent people, whatever their level of training or educational qualification, from taking up interesting internships.  The people interested in being interns range from postgraduates to those who have completed various levels of FETAC training.</p>

            <p eId="para_1112">The Department monitors the website, as do the people in FÁS.  This is an important job.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">Internationally, internships have a good history of filling in the gap for someone who has qualified at a certain level but in a recession cannot get a job because he does not have experience and cannot get experience because he cannot enter a job.  We want to stop that catch-22 situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1114">There is monitoring at each stage and, ultimately, when an intern is matched with a host employer, an agreement is made between the two of them, including an agreement to be monitored and to check, for instance, on the intern's side if he or she shows up, because he or she will get his or her social welfare and an extra €50 per week, and on the employer's side that the internship delivers what it said it would deliver.  In addition, if interns have problems they can complain and if an employer abuses the internship scheme, he or she will not be granted further internships.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">We are still at the start-up stage but I appreciate Deputies monitoring this.  It is helpful because it is the first time we have done it and there has been a hugely positive response.  I want this to work as well as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_608" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1118">I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 25 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">There will be an ongoing necessity to curtail overall expenditure in 2012 and in later years.  The comprehensive review of expenditure currently under way in all Departments and agencies will form the basis for making the necessary decisions to achieve this.  The outcome of the review will be considered by the Government in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">There are not 161,000 carers in receipt of payments from my Department.  That figure is the number of persons identified in the 2006 census as providing as little as one hour of care per week.  There are currently just over 51,000 full-time carers in receipt of a carer's allowance payment from the Department.  This includes almost 22,000 who are receiving half-rate carer's allowance in addition to another social welfare payment.  There are just over 1,700 people in receipt of carer's benefit.  In addition, more than 17,000 people who are not in receipt of a carer's allowance or benefit payment received the annual respite care grant of €1,700 in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">Since the introduction of the carer's allowance, payments to carers have been expanded greatly.  Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively and recipients are also eligible for household benefits, free travel and the respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">The rate of carer's allowance for those over 66 was maintained at €239 in the budget for 2011.  The current rate of carer's allowance for those aged under 66 is €204 per week.  The estimated expenditure for carers in 2011, including carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant is approximately €658 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">The means test for carers is one of the most liberal means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  The income disregard is currently €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €35,400 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  A couple with an income in the region of €59,300 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.</p>

          <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_609">
            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_1124">Last week the Minister indicated her intention to do a U-turn on the commitment to maintain social welfare rates by introducing a cut in the household benefits package.  That caused huge anxiety among carers and even the words she used in her answer about the means test, calling it one of the most liberal means tests, will cause further anxiety.  Will the Minister commit today to not cut or restrict in any way the carer's allowance, half rate carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance or respite care grant in the budget in December?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_610" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1125">A couple with an income of just under €60,000 can still qualify for a minimum payment in respect of carer's allowance while still getting the associated free travel and household benefits package.  In anyone's language, that is a generous income disregard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">I have already said the comprehensive review of expenditure is under way and budgetary decisions will be made in the context of the budget in December.  I am not in a position to indicate at this point what decisions will be made in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure and in the context of the budget.  I am simply not in a position to say anything; these are budgetary matters for the Minister for Finance and I am not in a position to give an undertaking on them at this point.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_611">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_1127">When talking about the liberalism of the means test for the carer's allowance, is it not the case that the real story is that carers save the State an estimated €2.5 billion euro per year, according to the Carers Association?  The cost to the State would be massively higher if those being cared for had to be looked after fully by the State.  Is it not also the case that what the Minister calls the generosity of the scheme results from the fact that carers have extra financial burdens, such as increased electricity costs, extra washing and lighting costs, extra heating costs and extra medical bills, along with many other extra burdens that other people do not have to face?  That is why we need a carer's allowance.  Carers are already shocked that the Minister has cut the home benefits package.  All they want is an assurance that given the contribution they make to the State and the welfare of sick and vulnerable people, the Minister will not cut their allowances further.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_612" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1128">I agree with the Deputy that carers do a very important job.  Their contribution in looking after members of their own families with particular needs, who are ill or may have a disability is truly heroic in many cases.  However, as I have said, I am not in a position at this time to make any commitments regarding the outcome of the comprehensive review of expenditure or budget 2012.  During the years when the economy was doing well we perhaps lost an opportunity to develop services which were often as important to carers, if not more so, than cash amounts, although they are important also.  In looking at the best way to assist carers in the important job they do within their own families I will certainly do everything I can to ensure carers are treated as fairly as possible within the system.  Given their significance and importance, particularly those providing full-time care for people with various needs, including disabilities, their needs must be recognised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Derek Keating</from>
            <p eId="para_1130">I will be very brief.  I know the Minister fully appreciates the value of the role and task of carers, as well as their commitment to helping those most in need of care.  Recently I have received a number of complaints from people who are experiencing delays in having their applications for carer's allowance processed.  Is the Minister aware of this and does she have any suggestions to make or plans to help to fast-track applications for carer's allowances?</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_615" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1131">Receipt of carer's allowance is based on medical evidence.  One of the difficulties with the system is that very often the initial application does not contain sufficient medical evidence of the quality required by deciding officers in the Department.  There is scope to improve on this because when decisions on applications for carer's allowance are appealed, the successful appeal rate is over 50% which suggests the initial application submitted is often inadequate.  There is something we can do in this regard.  Shortly after becoming Minister, I appointed an extra nine appeals officers because I was conscious of how important this matter was.  They will not just be deciding on appeals from carers, they will be working throughout the entire appeals structure.  We are beginning to make progress in reducing the time taken to process appeals.</p>

We already know how valuable it is from a human viewpoint.  Has any proposal been examined to differentiate between the levels of care provided, for example, low, medium or high dependency?  Does the Minister agree it would make sense for somebody who needs high dependency care who is bed-ridden to receive more assistance than someone who needs low dependency care?</p>

            <p eId="para_1133">It is alarming that the Minister cannot confirm there will not be cuts in this area in the budget.  The EU-IMF-ECB troika requires that there be "reforms" — as they are euphemistically called — in the social welfare system.

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_1134">I have a brief question about carers and the programme for Government.  The Labour Party made a commitment in its election manifesto to abolish the habitual residency condition for family carers, in particular.  Has there been any such move since the Minister has announced that she cannot stick to the commitment that there will be no social welfare cuts?</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_619" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1135">As regards Deputy Stanton's point on carers providing care for adults or children with a severe disability, I am not aware if such a study has been conducted.  The previous Government made commitments in respect of a carers' strategy.  From my own experience, the provision of services is as important as providing income.  For instance, the provision of services for a child with a high-level disability is absolutely critical.  I will come back to the Deputy on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">As regards the European Union and the IMF, I can only say to Deputy Boyd Barrett they have not mentioned the matter to me, but that is not to say they have not mentioned it, perhaps to officials, in their detailed discussions with the Department of Finance.  What they said about budget 2012 concerned reductions of €3.6 billion, if I remember correctly.  These included reductions in expenditure across the board.  However, as far as I am aware, they did not specify any particular areas.  As regards social protection, they did specify the need to activate people to move them from social welfare back into education, training and gaining work experience.  Mr. Chopra was extremely keen on this, as were some of his associates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">As regards the habitual residency condition, I will have to revert to Deputy Ó Snodaigh in some detail.</p>

          the position on the integration of community welfare officers into her Department, including whether it will be fully completed by September; if the necessary accommodation is available; and her plans to inform the public of the new situation.

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1139">The transfer of the community welfare service to the Department of Social Protection is part of the process of streamlining the health service.  By taking income support functions from the HSE and merging them with my Department, the HSE has more capacity to concentrate on its core functions of health service delivery.  As a first step in the process, the staff of the community welfare service were transferred on secondment to the Department from the Health Service Executive on 1 January this year.  During this time they have remained employees of the HSE and retained their current terms and conditions of employment.  Plans are well advanced to have them fully transferred to the Department by the end of September.  Talks are ongoing at the Labour Relations Commission to agree the terms for the final transfer.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the labour relations aspects of the transfer at this time.  The Department is confident that the talks, taking account of some recent recommendations from the Labour Court, will conclude in time for the transfer to be completed by the target date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">The community welfare officers coming into the Department are part of the creation of what one would call a public employment service, to be called the national employment and entitlements service, whereby somebody will be able to have an integrated service for entitlements to payments and income, as well as advice on jobs and training opportunities.  This will ensure people will be positively encouraged to take up options and opportunities offered in respect of training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">The transfer of the community welfare service to my Department is also part of the process of developing and implementing the national employment and entitlements service, a commitment given in the programme for Government.  In establishing this new service, the aim of the Department is to integrate employment and benefit payments within one service and thus provide a more complete service for customers. The focus of the new service will be on activation; enabling and encouraging the individual to take up job opportunities and engage on developmental pathways to employment.  Continued payment of full welfare allowances and benefits will be conditional on the individual engaging in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">Since January my Department and the HSE have been working closely to ensure the various HR and administrative systems such as payroll records and IT systems will be put in place for the full transfer of staff at the end of September.  Significant progress has been made as follows: legislation providing for the integration of the community welfare service with the Department, including the transfer of staff and buildings, was passed in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010.  This provision is subject to a commencement order which will be signed as soon as the full service is ready to transfer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">A programme of communications with community welfare service, CWS, staff is being implemented and this includes ongoing communications about the transformation agenda through newsletters, question and answer updates and information through the intranet and email.  In addition, all CWS staff were issued with a welcome pack at the beginning of the year and a number of meet and greet sessions for all staff have been held at six regional locations as follows: Dublin, Cork, Sligo, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">In relation to communications with the public and customers, a comprehensive external communications strategy is being prepared.  This will provide relevant and timely information for all stakeholders and key customer groups on changes to service delivery as they are implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">Until the end of June CWS staff continued to provide appeals and means-testing services in relation to medical cards and other health services.  The HSE has now established an alternative system for providing these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">An interim management structure has been put in place for the community welfare service.  This will be finalised as part of the full transfer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">As regards location, CWS staff will, on transfer, continue to be headquartered at their current base location or town.  However, in the interests of improving customer service and reducing costs, opportunities for co-location with other departmental staff will be pursued as appropriate.  This may involve staff of the Department moving to CWS locations or <i>vice versa</i>.  Any changes that may be proposed in relation to geographical deployment will take account of the relevant provisions on staff deployment contained in the public service agreement 2010-14.</p>

            <p eId="para_1149">I welcome the changes being brought about, as well as the concept of a one-stop-shop, as the Minister has described it.  My questions were not about labour relations and IR issues, and I welcome the fact that there is progress.  They were more about accommodation.  If they are being transferred, has the accommodation been made available?  Will it be available by September to ensure that they are in the same building as people dealing with applications for social welfare payments?  Will there be an advertising campaign on this so that the public know about the change?  It is a substantial change, given the fact that many people have been dependent on the community welfare officer system.  I hope people will understand what they are entitled to apply for in the future, so that if they are refused at one hatch, they can go to another hatch rather than to another building.</p>

            <p eId="para_1150">I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  It is anticipated that there will be no change to current base locations immediately following transfer.  However, as the establishment of the national employment and entitlements service progresses, there will inevitably be changes in office locations to facilitate the integration and the provision of the so-called one-stop-shop area to customers.  This may mean that departmental staff could transfer to community welfare officer locations or vice versa.  The Department is working on a stakeholder communication strategy to ensure that communication is made with internal and external customers in the most appropriate way at the most appropriate time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">I am aware that there is a long history of particular individuals having an ongoing relationship with a particular community welfare officer in their district or area.  That is very valuable to certain people, and we will do our best to ensure that this service remains intact.  However, there is also more direct payment of certain services at the local office, such as the one-parent family payment.  That often entailed visits to community welfare officers while the payment on the status was being sorted out.  That should now happen directly in the social welfareoffice.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_631" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1164">I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 26 and 37 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">Figures on the breakdown of decisions in respect of the 28,166 appeals disposed of by the social welfare appeals office during 2010 are enclosed in the following table.  I am informed by the social welfare appeals office that the number of appeals waiting to be processed on 17 July was 19,525.  There are limited statistics available on the number of individuals in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance for greater than three months pending an appeal for a social welfare payment.  However, Department records show that there are currently 1,257 such  individuals awaiting the outcome of their appeal on either a jobseeker's allowance, a jobseeker's benefit or an illness benefit claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">In an effort to reduce the backlog of appeals, I made nine additional appointments to the appeals office in recent weeks.  These assignments will augment the three appointments made to the office in 2010, bringing the total number of appeals officers serving in the office to 29.   In addition, since July 2010, eight retired appeals officers, equating to a further three full-time officers, have been assisting on a strictly part-time basis with the backlogs of appeals and it is intended that they will be employed until the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">I am assured by the chief appeals officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the social welfare appeals office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the office and to reduce the overall processing times for dealing with appeals.  In that regard, 3,000 cases registered prior to 31 December 2010 have been ring fenced and a team of ten of the most experienced appeals officers have been freed from all other work in the office and will concentrate on clearing this backlog.  This project began on 1 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">More emphasis is now being placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis where possible to increase productivity.  In some cases, if applications were made more clearly and the medical evidence more clearly laid out, that would certainly assist the process of making a decision in the first instance.   As a result, the number of appeals dealt with by way of oral hearing was reduced from 42% for the first six months of 2010 to just over 30% for the same period in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">I have been to the appeals office to visit the staff.  They are under tremendous pressure and to give them their due, they are working flat out to deal with the backlog.</p>

            <p eId="para_1191">I thank the Minister for her reply. I am delighted to hear of the progress that is being made.  Has the Minister a target set for waiting times, whether it would be acceptable to have three weeks or five weeks or what would be the target time at the end of this process?  Is it true that the number of appeals received by the social welfare appeals office has increased by more 100% from 2007 to 2010?  Can the Minister advise as to why this might be the case?  Has it anything to do with claims being refused by deciding officers or the application of stricter qualifications criteria?  Can the Minister advise on the impact of the office deciding more appeals by summary decision?  Is this translating into more appeals being turned down?  How is the decision on whether to grant an oral hearing made?  Who makes the decision?  Are there transparent criteria for that?</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1192">I will arrange for the details to be forwarded to the Deputy.  There has been an enormous increase in the number of appeals.  The number of them has multiplied several times in each of the recent years.  There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals in 2009 compared with 2008, and that was 27% greater than the number in 2007.  There was a further increase of 26% in the number of appeals received in 2010.  There has been an enormous increase in the number of appeals.  I will forward the Deputy the statistical information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">On the question of cutting back the time involved in the processing of an appeal, we are not yet at the stage where we can give an indicative time for this.  We have to reduce the backlog and improve the system.  People will be familiar with the idea that in the case of passport applications and citizenship applications, it has become a standard that an applicant must complete the application properly and that greatly increases the opportunity to deal with the application at first instance.  If applications can be dealt with on a summary, first instance basis, then the matters which go to appeal can be dealt with much more rapidly.  Because there is more than a 50% success rate on appeals, that is a strong indication that many of the appeals are not fully presented with the fullest amount of information that would enhance the making of a decision by the person who decides initially and, subsequently, on appeal.</p>

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_1194">The Minister has referred previously to the review by a deciding officer before an application would reach the stage of an appeal.  I wonder if anything more can be done in that respect.  For instance, in many cases where an application for carer's allowance is refused, a simple telephone call or an explanation of the information that is missing would probably prevent the application having to be appealed in the first instance.  Can more be done at the early stage of the processing of applications before the stage of appeal?  This would help to reduce the waiting list.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_635" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1195">That is a very sensible suggestion.  As the community welfare officers move into the Department, this is an area where they in particular probably have enhanced experience and sensitivity.  Perhaps we can have better advisory services and a better quality of information available in citizens information centres.  Various organisations supply excellent information which enables people to make a much more directed application that is likely to be successful.  We will return to this topic as, hopefully, we reduce the backlog and we will see what can be done to streamline and improve the quality of the application process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1196">I did not realise that Question No. 26 was being taken with Question No. 22.  These are difficult times and the appeals system is under severe pressure.  The Minister said that community welfare officers will be transferring to her Department.  Will that require the introduction of legislation?  Under the 2005 supplementary welfare legislation, SI 412, a community welfare officer has exceptional powers of discretion when it comes to emergency funding or in circumstances where he or she and the primary team who might work with the community came across a situation that allows them to override the system.  The Minister is aware that the supplementary welfare legislation is known as the payment of last resort and considerable changes have taken place in practice whereby the community welfare officer can now act as a buffer until the appeals system is dealt with.  I am mindful of extraordinary cases, be they of poverty, where a special appliance is needed, a payment is required by a person who is terminally ill and there may be no time to carry out a means test, or a payment is required to cover the cost of a funeral.  Is there a need for the supplementary welfare legislation to be reviewed?  When community welfare officers transfer to her Department, will they no longer have the title "community welfare officers"?  What level of community contact will they have and will there be a service available for people with exceptional needs, some examples of which I gave?</p>

            <p eId="para_1197">Negotiations are ongoing in the Labour Relations Commission in regard to the community welfare officers.  They will become full civil servants and they will be community welfare officers.  On the matter of whether changes are required to the legislation, I will return to the Deputy on that.  First, we must achieve the integration of the service.  The community welfare officers have a potentially extremely valuable and important role to play in improving the services of the Department.  The number of people getting special needs payments and the amounts of the payments have grown significantly in recent years.  It is perhaps an area which could be reviewed but first we want to get the integration of the community welfare officers into the Department and that in itself is a big job.  There will be up to 1,000 extra staff and that will be a big change for the staff in the Department of Social Protection.  Obviously it will be a very big change for the community welfare officers.  There has been a fair number of meetings of senior staff in the Department with community welfare officers and I am very anxious to see them successfully joining the staff of the Department.</p>

Durkan — the need to amend legislation in order to provide accommodation for persons becoming homeless by being made redundant; (3) Deputy James Bannon — the need to debate the decision which has led to the suppression of the posts of resource teacher for Travellers and the rural co-ordinator for disadvantage at St. Mary's national school, Edgeworthstown, County Longford; (4) Deputy Thomas P. Broughan — the provision of acute psychiatric services in the north Dublin and Fingal area; (5) Deputy Joe Costello — the reason persons in receipt of income less than the supplementary welfare allowance are ineligible to apply for a medical card; (6) Deputy Michelle Mulherin — the need to confirm DEIS status for Inver national school, Barnatra, Ballina, County Mayo; (7) Deputy Kevin Humphreys — the cost to the taxpayer through the four local authorities in Dublin of acquiring the incinerator site at Poolbeg; (8) Deputy Noel Coonan — the need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to outline his policy on the future of court sittings in Roscrea and Borrisokane, to state whether his Department will revisit and reconsider the proposal by the Courts Service to cease sittings at Roscrea and Borrisokane District Courts and merge both areas with the District Court area of Nenagh, taking into consideration the considerable inconvenience and expense this move will incur for the people of the locality, the lack of consultation with communities and shareholders, the displacement of gardaí from both areas to attend the court sittings and to make a statement in this regard; (9) Deputy Mattie McGrath — the extremely serious changes being introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, namely, the motion on planning and development regulations that are literally with the stroke of a pen condemning each and every parcel of land perceived to be wetland over 30 sq. m requiring planning permission and any parcel over 2 ha. requiring an EIS to never again being utilised by rural families for any productive use; (10) Deputy Anthony Lawlor — the need for funding from the environment fund to be ring-fenced for the remediation of the landfill site at Kerdiffstown, Naas, County Kildare; (11) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett — the introduction of a national home retrofit loan scheme; (12) Deputy Gerald Nash — the pardoning of former Defence Forces servicemen who deserted during the Second World War in order to fight fascism; (13) Deputy Ciarán Lynch — the need to amend the Litter Pollution Act 1997 to allow local authorities to take action when waste is not visible; and (14) Deputy Dessie Ellis — in the light of the fact that since the economic collapse there has been a considerable rise in the incidence of suicide across Ireland and specifically in my own area of Dublin North West which has been very hard hit with a number of deaths of young people by suicide and there being no doubt that the desperation of the recession is a major contributory factor, to ask what is being done to tackle this problem and what more can be done.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
          <p eId="para_1203">Last Wednesday I published the Cloyne report and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I set out the Government's response.  On that occasion I said it was difficult to read the report and avoid despair.  My feelings have been strengthened by the reactions of victims and their families in the week since the report was published.  Sadly, some of the victims are no longer with us, but their families have spoken.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the victims for their courage in telling the commission of investigation about their experiences of abuse and what happened afterwards when they came in contact with those in authority who were in a position to take action which would have made a difference to their plight and that of others.  I share the commission's hope the report's publication may to some degree alleviate the hurt and anger they rightly and naturally feel.  We should also pay tribute to the work of all those individuals and organisations that have supported them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">I acknowledge the contribution of Judge Yvonne Murphy and her colleagues on the commission of investigation.  They have delivered a report of clarity and carried out their difficult task sensitively and meticulously.  The victims had to relive painful memories and the commission members had to help them to relive these memories in the least distressing way possible, while at the same maintaining a professional approach.  They succeeded admirably in doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">The report's findings are unambiguous.  It is severely critical of the diocese of Cloyne.  The response of the diocese to complaints and allegations of child sexual abuse in the period from 1996 to 2008 was totally inadequate and inappropriate.  Specifically, church guidelines were not fully or consistently implemented in the diocese.  Primary responsibility for this lies with the bishop who the report describes as ineffective and the vicar general charged with investigating complaints against priests of child sexual abuse who did not approve of the procedures set out in the church guidelines, in particular, the requirement to report to the civil authorities.  The diocese failed to report all complaints to the Garda.  Out of 15 complaints in the period that should have been reported, nine were not.  In two of these the subject of the complaint was a minor at the time the complaint was made.  After reporting complaints against one priest in 1996, the diocese did not report any complaints to the health authorities again until 2008.  Furthermore, it did not put a proper support system in place, as mandated by church guidelines, nor did it operate an advisory panel which was independent.  The panel's documentation was inadequate and the diocese did not properly record and maintain information on complaints of child sexual abuse up to 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">The report describes as quite extraordinary the failure to read and take heed of the 2004 McCoy report on the diocese's procedures and processes which showed that the diocese was not implementing required procedures.  The diocese did not carry out proper canonical investigations, nor did it comply with the 1999 child care guidelines.  It is appalling that those who presented a public face of concern had a private agenda of concealment and evasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">The commission found that in 2008 the diocese had started to follow the procedures set out in the church documents and it is satisfied that the diocese now has an independent advisory panel.  It commends the diocese for its efforts in training both church personnel and the laity in the area of child protection and for recruiting risk assessment specialists in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">Particularly disturbing is the commission's finding that the Vatican's response to the church guidelines was entirely unhelpful, describing them as "merely a study document".  This gave comfort and support to those who dissented from the guidelines.  The Vatican's intervention and the letter sent by the papal nuncio undermined not only the obligation of dioceses to comply with the church's own framework document but also the application of the State's child care guidelines.  Rightly, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has pursued this matter with the papal nuncio.  We await the Vatican's official response.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I are taking a twofold approach.  We are responding to the immediate problems identified in the report and, importantly, introducing measures which will help to establish the system of child protection children need and deserve.  We cannot depend on the undertakings of others to correct failings and introduce robust and effective structures of protection.  The Cloyne report irrefutably confirms that some who in the past gave such undertakings acted in bad faith.  It is important to remember that the people primarily responsible for the abuse at the centre of the report were the abusers themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">The Garda Commissioner has appointed Assistant Commissioner Derek Byrne to examine the report and determine whether further action can be taken against the abusers referred to in it.  The Garda has set up a special telephone line which victims of clerical abuse or anyone who has information on abuse can contact.   Following the publication of the report on the Dublin archdiocese, Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney was appointed to examine it specifically in relation to how complaints had been handled and investigated by the church and State authorities to determine whether there had been criminal behaviour.  A number of files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the examination will now be extended to the Cloyne report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">After the publication of the Dublin archdiocese report, the Garda Inspectorate was requested to carry out a comprehensive review of Garda arrangements for dealing with allegations of child sexual abuse.  I have agreed with the chief inspector, Kathy O'Toole, that in the weeks prior to the publication of its report, it will be given a chance to review its findings in the light of the Cloyne report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">Most regrettably, the commission was very concerned about the approach adopted by gardaí in a small number of cases.  Following consultations with the Garda Commissioner, I have sent the report to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to examine it as a matter of urgency and see whether further action is warranted.  That examination is taking place.  I repeat to the House the apology I gave last week on behalf of the State for the Garda's failure in three cases detailed in the report.  These failures should not have occurred.  It is important to note that the commission's overall conclusion was that the Garda response to the cases covered by the report had been generally adequate and appropriate.  A number of complainants were highly complimentary about the way in which gardaí had dealt with their complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">I am also determined to deal with the deeper gaps which underlie the report.  Last week I published detailed legislative proposals for a criminal justice (withholding information on crimes against children and vulnerable adults) Bill.  Deputy Calleary proposed that my proposals be considered by the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and I have no difficulty with this proposal.  What I am proposing will make it an offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment for a person who has information that could help in the arrest, prosecution or conviction of an offender of a serious offence committed against a child or vulnerable adult not to pass that information on to the Garda where he or she knows that information could help.  We have already done substantial work on this in consultation with the Attorney General and her office and I intend that it will be a Government legislative priority to have it enacted in the autumn.  Its enactment will enable the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate and prosecute those who conceal and fail to report to the Garda sexual offences against children.  The legal position will be clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">We have to ensure in so far as possible those who come into contact with children do not present a danger.  There is widespread agreement that we need to make it possible to disclose what is called soft information where this is necessary to protect children.  The need for legislation in this area was most recently highlighted in the report published by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children which in September 2008 called for the necessary legislation to be published by the then Government by the following December.  Unfortunately, the Government failed to meet that commitment and the legislation was not published during its lifetime.  I am working to bring proposals to the Government next week setting out the heads of a national vetting bureau Bill to place the vetting of persons working with children and vulnerable adults on a statutory basis.  The vetting of persons for certain employment positions is available on a non-statutory basis.  The Bill will provide a legislative basis for existing arrangements in line with the recommendations of the joint committee and the disclosure of soft information for the purposes of child protection.  Following Government approval the heads of the Bill will be furnished to the Attorney General's office with a view also to its publication in final form and enactment in the next Dáil session.  As part of the Government's new approach to legislation, the Oireachtas justice committee will have the opportunity to consider its content and to propose in September any constructive amendments or additions, and to contribute to the Bill's developmental process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">I am determined to ensure that the church and State do what is necessary to protect our children from those who sexually prey on them or physically abuse them.  I am determined that those who work with children and those who recruit others to do so, in either the public or private sector, in commercial or voluntary organisations, behave with awareness and responsibility and in the best interests of children.  I am determined to ensure that those who know a child has been assaulted or abused will be required to report such offence to the Garda and that there will be consequences for their failing to do so.  I am determined that children will not be put in the way of harm to be preyed on by those already known to have harmed a child.  We cannot correct past wrongs perpetrated on our children but we can take action to prevent, in so far as is possible, the wrongs of the past being perpetrated on our children in the future.  Let us on all sides in this House join together in clearly stating that in addressing and bringing to justice those who perpetrate child sexual abuse, the era of "mental reservation" is over and the laws of this land will prevail and be applied.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_642">
          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
          <p eId="para_1216">Shock, revulsion, dismay and sadness — the full lexicon of condemnation has been used in response to the report of the Murphy commission into the Diocese of Cloyne.  I share those sentiments while realising that no words of mine can do justice to the horrors that were inflicted on those who suffered child abuse.  It is the survivors that should be foremost in our thoughts when dealing with this subject.  The hurt they feel must only be surpassed by the bravery of those who came forward to give evidence to the commission of investigation.  I only hope that the publication of the report will give them some comfort that, at last, their dreadful experiences are being believed and acknowledged.  We must bear in mind the many other survivors whose experience of abuse is known to themselves alone and who continue to feel unable to articulate what they went through.  The State owes a significant debt of gratitude to those survivors who gave evidence to the commission and to the members of the commission itself — Ms Ita Mangan, Mr. Hugh O'Neill and its chairperson, Judge Yvonne Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The most shocking aspect of this report is that the failures it describes are not ancient history.  All of the complaints, allegations, concerns and suspicions of child sexual abuse referred to in the report occurred between January 1996 and February 2009.  The year 1996 is the crucial dividing line in the handling of clerical sexual abuse in Ireland as it was the year in which the Catholic Church in Ireland put in place detailed procedures for dealing with child sexual abuse.  The mishandling of complaints of child sexual abuse by members of the Catholic hierarchy can never be excused no matter when it occurred, and the fact that the Cloyne diocese simply ignored the guidelines and procedures put in place by the hierarchy is utterly unforgivable.  It placed children in greater danger and compounded the suffering and feeling of betrayal of survivors even further.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">That the authorities in the Diocese of Cloyne, in particular Bishop John Magee and Monsignor Denis O'Callaghan, failed in their duty until so recently gives the lie to the oft repeated mantra that the response to abuse reported in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was a product of its time, when bishops and others had little understanding of the nature and scale of abuse.  This was never a defence and has been rubbished even more by the revelation that the church's own guidelines were not being followed in Cloyne until 2008.  In addition, the attitude of the Vatican towards the Irish church's guidelines and to the commission of investigation was nothing short of deplorable. It is not the behaviour that we expect from a sovereign state with whom we have friendly relations, and it certainly lacked the moral courage and integrity that one would expect from an entity that preaches such values.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">When the Cloyne report is added to what we have learned from the Murphy commission's report into the Dublin archdiocese, the Ryan report and the many other aspects of the scandal of clerical abuse, one conclusion is very clear — self regulation is not enough, and it must be backed up by a robust legislative framework.  In that regard, I welcome the proposals put forward by the Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Fitzgerald, and I look forward to debating the detail of them in the House.  I hope that will occur as a matter of urgency when we return in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">I particularly welcome the commitment that persons in certain professions, including clergy, will be obliged to report suspicions of abuse or face criminal penalty.  This is an important step but it must be backed up by the appropriate resources.  The experience in other jurisdictions, where a mandatory reporting requirement has been put in place, is that the volume of reports of abuse increases massively.  For example, the number of reports made increased six-fold when mandatory reporting was introduced in New South Wales in Australia.  It is vital that the number of social workers is increased to cope with this.  If this does not happen, the mandatory reporting requirement may actually end up doing more harm than good, with social workers sitting at their desks assessing the urgency of cases rather than getting out of the office and fulfilling their role of supporting families and protecting children.  I urge the Minister to assess carefully over the summer the resource requirements involved in mandatory reporting before coming back to the House with legislation in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">The other main policy issue which arises here is whether to extend the remit of the commission of investigation to the remaining dioceses.  Fianna Fáil's position is that at the very least all survivors should have the opportunity to have their experiences acknowledged in a formal setting.  It would be unfair to survivors of abuse in the 23 remaining dioceses that they would not have the chance to give testimony to what they endured.  I appreciate that many do not wish to revisit this painful chapter in their lives.  However, many survivors were met with scepticism or denial when they first came forward with their stories and so desire to have it acknowledged that they were telling the truth.  Fianna Fáil has an open mind on whether this needs to be done through a full blown commission of investigation and we hope that we can have a discussion on it in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">It is sensible that the relevant Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Fitzgerald, should wait for the completion of the HSE and the Catholic Church's national board for safeguarding children audits to be completed before making a final decision on this.  I know some doubt has been cast — not unreasonably — on the usefulness of these audits given that they rely on voluntary information from the church authorities.  We should wait to see Mr. Ian Elliot's assessment of the audits and what level of compliance there is from bishops in publishing the audits.  It is our belief that nothing short of full publication by all bishops would be acceptable.  I note that the stance being taken by the Government now differs from that expressed by the Fine Gael spokesperson on children a few months ago, who called for the Murphy commission to be extended to all dioceses.  We should continue to consider the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">There is also a cross-Border dimension to the question of extending the commission's work.  Six dioceses fall into this category, and we believe it is important that the two Ministers consult their colleagues in the Northern Executive regarding co-operation to ensure that the audits and any possible extension of the Murphy commission can take place effectively.  Perhaps they could update the House on their contacts in that regard when responding to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">The systematic and endemic abuse of children by clergy that has been revealed in report after report shames our State and our nation.  Church and State failed far too many children by exposing them to predatory abusers and then compounded their suffering by failing to act in an effective manner when the abuse was brought to light.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">For the sake of some of the survivors, I hope prosecutions will follow from the publication of the Cloyne report.  More importantly, perhaps, the outcome of the work of the Murphy commission should be total dedication on the part of official Ireland to ensuring all children are protected to the greatest extent possible.  That is the priority of my party, as I am sure it is of all Members of the House.  I am sure we will disagree on nuances, but Ministers can be assured that they will find willing allies on this side of the House in all their efforts to protect children.  I hope we can work towards that objective on a cross-party basis.  In that spirit, I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1228">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and would like to deal with one aspect of the issue.  Just as it is right that we abhor child abuse, it is important for us to understand its effects and destructive outcomes for children.  When child abuse occurs, the victim can develop a variety of distressing feelings, thoughts and behaviours.  No child is psychologically prepared to cope with repeated sexual stimulation.  Even a two year old who cannot know sexual activity is wrong will develop problems as a result of his or her inability to cope with over-stimulation.  A child of five years or older who knows and cares for the abuser will become trapped between affection or loyalty for the person and the sense that sexual activities are terribly wrong.  If the child tries to break away from the sexual relationship, the abuser may threaten the child with violence or loss of love.  A child who is the victim of prolonged sexual abuse usually develops low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness and abnormal or distorted views on sex.  The child may become withdrawn or mistrustful of adults.  He or she can become suicidal.  Children who have been sexually abused have difficulty relating to others other than on sexual terms.  Some become child abusers or prostitutes, or experience other serious problems, when they reach adulthood.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">There are often no obvious physical signs of child sexual abuse.  A number of signs can be detected through physical examination by a doctor.  Sexually abused children may develop an unusual interest in, or avoidance of, things of a sexual nature.  They can experience sleep problems and often have nightmares.  They can suffer depression and become withdrawn from friends or family.  They may make statements about their bodies being "dirty" or "damaged".  They might think there is something wrong with them in the genitals area.  They may refuse to go to school, or become delinquent and have behavioural problems.  They often become secretive.  They sometimes display aspects of their sexual molestation in their drawings, games or fantasies.  They may be unusually aggressive.  The child may be extremely fearful of telling someone, although he or she might talk freely when a special effort has been made to help him or her to feel safe.  If a child says he or she has been molested, parents should try to remain calm and reassure him or her that what happened was not his or her fault.  They should seek a medical examination and a psychiatric consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">The initial and short-term effects of abuse usually occur within two years of the termination of the abuse.  These effects vary depending on the circumstances of the abuse and the child's stage of development.  They may include regressive behaviour such as a return to thumb-sucking or bed-wetting, sleep disturbance, eating problems, behavioural or performance problems in school and non-participation in school and social activities.  The negative effects of child abuse can affect victims for many years and into adulthood.  Adults who were sexually abused as children commonly experience depression.  High levels of anxiety in these adults can result in self-destructive behaviours such as alcoholism, drug abuse, anxiety attacks, situation specific anxiety disorders and insomnia.  Many victims encounter problems in their adult relationships and adult sexual functioning.  Revictimisation is a common phenomenon in people who were abused as children.  Research has shown that child sexual abuse victims are more likely to be victims of rape or be involved in physically abusive relationships as adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">The ill-effects of child abuse are wide-ranging.  There is no one set of symptoms or outcomes.  Some children report little or no psychological distress from the abuse.  These children may be afraid to express their emotions and may be denying their feelings as a coping mechanism.  Other children may have sleeper effects — experiencing no harm in the short term but suffering serious problems in later life.  In an attempt to assess whether a child can recover from sexual abuse and to better understand the ill-effects of child abuse, psychologists have studied the factors that seem to lessen the impact of such abuse.  The factors that affect the amount of harm done to the victim include the age of the child, the duration, frequency and intrusiveness of the abuse, the degree of force used and the relationship with the abuser.  Issues such as the child's interpretation of the abuse, whether he or she discloses the abuse and how quickly he or she reports it also affect the short-term and long-term consequences of the abuse.  As I said, it is very easy and important to abhor child abuse.  It is just as important to understand its effects and destructive outcomes for children.</p>

          <p eId="para_1232">I welcome the motion.  I am pleased that the proposed mandatory reporting of knowledge of abuse of children and vulnerable adults, as envisaged in the Children First national guidance document and recommended in the Ryan report, will be set in stone through legislation of this Parliament.  I commend the Taoiseach, the Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Fitzgerald, and all Members who are grasping the nettle.  The institution of the Catholic Church failed to act correctly to protect the innocence of the country's children.  Those involved did not live up to their responsibilities as representatives of God's kingdom on Earth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">Many of us who were raised as Christians in the Catholic tradition are absolutely dismayed by the failure of the institution in these matters to honour and stand by Christian principles that transcend Canon Law.  The separation of church and State is an imperative.  It is in keeping with the worldly authority given to us as Christians.  If it were not the case that the rule of the Earth was given to men and women, surely the perpetrators of these most heinous crimes, including some priests, would be struck down by God.  We know this has not happened.  Therefore, it is a matter for us as human beings to correct these wrongs politically and by means of the law.  In this case, we can do so by introducing appropriate legislation.  This domain is our God-given responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">The comments of Fr. Vincent Twomey, professor emeritus in theology in Maynooth, demand a response.  He spoke about the sanctity of the seal of the confessional, as set out in Canon Law.  He said, in effect, any interference by the civil law would offend God in some way.  He also said he was "incandescent with rage" when he learned of the contents of the Cloyne report.  He is unrepentant about the shocking truth of how the systems of the Catholic Church served to protect abusers and sacrifice innocents in the process — not just in years gone by but also today in modern Ireland.  This attitude created a climate favourable to abuse in the first place and will allow it to continue.  We will not address the problem by calling for the heads of a few bishops to roll towards atonement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">It is nothing short of idolatry to regard the institution as a sacred cow.  Idolatry is forbidden in the first and second commandments because it creates a substitute God.  Evil acts like child abuse are carried out by individuals who are individually accountable to God who gladly pardons repentant sinners.  It is not written anywhere that God's forgiveness and divine law will protect, or be used to protect, someone who has committed a crime from the full rigours of our criminal justice system.  No institution is sacred but for the God they worship.  When an institution's members accept acts contrary to God's will, God rejects and judges the institution.  No institution is infallible.  Every institution is a human construct, even if it has a divine mandate.  The Old Testament is full of examples of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">Our Lord — Jesus Christ — said that if anyone harmed one of "these little ones", it would be better for that person "to be drowned".  He never spoke more seriously, other than when he said it would have been better if His traitor had never been born.  Members of the Catholic Church who truly love God should be glad that this evil which was perpetrated by false shepherds has been exposed in order that they can be rid of it.  It is because I care very much about the Catholic Church and want to see it at its best that I say this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">Again, I congratulate the Government on taking this step which is long overdue and for which we as a nation have been crying out for decades.  If we do not protect our children, who will?  I am proud to be part of this Government which is taking this action.</p>

        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_647">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_1238">I wish to share time with Deputy McLellan.  As was previously stated this morning by my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, while my party welcomes the motion, we certainly would have liked to have seen more robust wording in some areas.  Yesterday's draft motion was more definitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">As someone who is a devout Catholic and who puts great stock in his faith, I must say reading the Cloyne report was very disturbing.  Not only has the action or, depending on how one looks at it, inaction of the church caused untold suffering on victims, it has betrayed the many people like myself who placed faith in the teachings of the church.  The church authorities have failed to live up to the expectations of those who believe in its teachings, and who are still committed to the teachings, by failing to get their house in order and putting their own self-interest above the protection of children.  They have done themselves a disservice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">No doubt this is a depressing and painful chapter in Irish history, with each new revelation even more shocking than the one that preceded it.  The Catholic Church, the State, society and all of us as individuals must ensure there is real change in this issue.  We could not afford the failings of the past and we certainly cannot afford to leave our children exposed in the future.  There is no easy solution to end the vile crime of child sexual abuse but we must ensure all the necessary protections available to us as a society are in place.  The safety of our children is paramount.  There is no room for political points scoring or ambiguity.  Society demands action and our children deserve action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">We failed to learn from the lessons of the past.  We have seen the Ferns, Ryan and Murphy reports, and now we have Cloyne.  While the Cloyne report did not investigate the abuse, but rather how the church did or did not deal with the allegations, it was still very sickening to read.  The various infractions contained in this report have been detailed in the House, in the media and in homes throughout this State.  The unacceptable lack of recording surrounding child sexual abuse allegations and the failure to report nine out of 15 complaints made against members of the clergy is a shocking indictment on the church as an entity.  Abuse allegations that the report states very clearly should have been reported to the relevant authorities and were not tell their own story.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">The Commission also tells of how the papal nuncio said that he was unable to assist in this matter when requested for information.  The personal statement yesterday of Fr. Lombardi just does not cut it.  What we need, and demand, is an official response from the Vatican.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">The State must also face up to its failings.  Concerns regarding the approach of Garda investigations in two cases and a dispute between the Commission and the Garda on whether an investigation actually occurred in a third case are worrying revelations.  This level of State incompetence is particularly worrying in the context of the recent reports on the Ferry-Donegal school abuse controversy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">One lesson we must learn from this report relates to guidelines and rules.  It is now clear that guidelines are meaningless unless there is a legal requirement placed on those tasked with implementing them or the guidelines themselves are put on a statutory footing.  That is why I welcome the comments from the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and their strong, unequivocal response in the wake of this report.  I assure both Ministers that Sinn Féin will not be found wanting in supporting promised legislation by the Government that can ensure increased protections for children.  We have long advocated the use of soft information on persons who have had allegations of child sexual abuse made against them.  It is a vital tool in protecting children in the future and we look forward to the publication of the promised national vetting bureau Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">There is no room for knee-jerk legislation in this area.  We should not do something for the sake of being seen to do it.  We need good, well thought-out and comprehensive legislation on the mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse.  The proposed legislation on withholding information on crimes against children and vulnerable adults is urgently needed and we welcome the commitment of the Government to move swiftly on this.  Then, and only then, can we bring about a situation where the children of this State have adequate protections.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_648">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_1246">At the outset, I commend the rigorous work of her honour Judge Yvonne Murphy and the commission.  It is an absolute disgrace that it was necessary at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">Regrettably, we have all been down this road before.  We have seen the Ferns, Ryan and Murphy reports and now this particular report on the diocese of Cloyne — more cases of the abuse of children by priests and a church reluctant, at the very best, to live up to its responsibilities to protect its flock.  Unfortunately, it is no longer shocking that the Catholic Church failed our children.  We have been over similar ground previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">Far too often we have investigated the unhealthy relationship between church and State and the horrors that have been perpetrated on children by both over a long period.  My party believes the motion before the House today should have acknowledged the failure of this State to protect children in law and in reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">What astonishes most people about this report is that it related to a time when the Catholic Church in Ireland had put in place detailed procedures for dealing with child sexual abuse, and during a period of constant revelations about child abuse by priests.  Best practice, as contained in guidelines and rules, does not matter one iota if there is not implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">There was abject failure on behalf of the church and to a lesser degree the State.  This report details a litany of concealment and evasion by the Catholic Church, including Bishop Magee's incomplete account of how he was handling allegations; the diocese failure to report nine out of 15 complaints made against priests which clearly should have been reported; the failure to report the two cases in which the alleged victims were minors at the time the complaint was made; the placing by the diocese of far too much emphasis on the concerns of the alleged offenders; Monsignor O'Callaghan withholding the identity of an alleged perpetrator from authorities and attempting to have a particular Garda carry out the investigation; the commission statement that it cannot understand how the monsignor concluded no sexual abuse had occurred in a situation where clearly and unequivocally it had — the mind boggles; bad policing practices by the Garda in three cases; an allegation made against Bishop Magee in 2008 which called into question his judgment; and one complaint in 1996 and another in 2008 being all that was reported to the health authorities.  I cannot imagine the pain, hurt and suffering caused by this abuse.  I extend my deepest sympathies to all the victims.  In the case of Cloyne, they are my friends and neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">I am glad that the Government has taken issue with the disgraceful lack of engagement by the papal nuncio with the commission and the outrageous interference of the Vatican in matters of child protection in this State.  While we still await an official Vatican response, the comments today from the papal nuncio do not go nearly far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">I welcome the Government's stated priority of bringing abusers to justice, in particular, the appointment of the assistant commissioner to examine the possibility of doing this.  In addition, I make a personal call on all abuse victims to go straight to the Garda as the body best able to deal with allegations of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">Sinn Féin will not be found wanting in supporting promised legislation by the Government if it can be proven to improve child protection.  Like my colleagues, I call for well worked-out, good legislation and the resources to ensure the outcomes we desire.  Sinn Féin is heartened by the Children First child protection guidelines being placed on a statutory footing.  The Government has made firm commitments on these following the Cloyne report.  We are determined to ensure these commitments are delivered upon.  We support the motion before the House today with the caveat that we would have preferred some areas to be stronger.  This has been a long and painful chapter in Irish history and the reports and investigations are set to continue.  The Legislature must ensure that from this day forth no child is ever subjected to the horrors visited upon the victims detailed in the reports to date.  This must end immediately.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ReginaDoherty" eId="spk_649">
          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_1254">I am pleased to speak on the motion but I am distressed and saddened that we are discussing the matter in Parliament today.  I wish to focus on something one of the victims said last week. She said, "I smell freedom".  The phrase has been going around and around in my head.  In many ways I am pleased for that lady because people who have been sexually abused or those close to people who have been sexually abused explain that there is no escape or freedom.  I am glad that lady feels that she is nearing the place of escape from what she has been through.  There is a great deal of suppression by victims but there is no escape because one can never be prepared for the trigger that set off the roller-coaster of pain, the vivid memories, the re-living, the "if onlys" and the "what ifs".  The life of victims is one of constantly rehashing something over which they have no control.  For many victims the only escape is to suppress the myriad emotions which sexual abuse causes and not to deal with them.  It gives me great hope that at least one victim has stated that she smells freedom and I pray for a good deal more of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">The hierarchy of the Catholic Church has let down the children of Ireland very badly.  According to Rome, the church is infallible in its definitions on faith and morals.  Plainly, this infallibility only takes regard to the principles rather than the application.  The rules of conduct differ so widely when one considers the Vatican's direct intervention in Ireland undermined our child protection framework and directly contributed to the vast number of victims of the clerical sexual abuse.  The church's ideals around the Canon Law versus State law argument clearly demonstrate how out of touch the church is.  Clerics assumed and continue to assume the high moral ground using the cloak of Canon Law, while contributing directly to the abuse of children and then to covering it up.  This is heartbreaking for any Catholic or Christian in this country and it causes its own set of internal faith dilemmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">I am encouraged that we are putting on a statutory basis the measures necessary to ensure every child is protected here.  There is no more doubt.  No longer will we leave it to chance or to an internal moral code which, we now know, does not exist among some members of our infallible church.  The church as an institution has a great deal for which to atone.  It must reflect on this moral dilemma and leave law-making to the legislators.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">I take great solace in my faith, my spirituality and in God.  The gospel of Mark states, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God".  It gives me solace that the gospel goes on to state that "those whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea".  I believe in heaven and an afterlife and I believe that someday we must all stand before God Almighty and be judged.  It gives me solace that all of those who perpetrated these crimes against children and young adults in the past must stand before their maker at some stage one day.  It gives me comfort that our State will enact legislation at this time to take care of people who have failed children by directly involving themselves in the abuse of children or thereafter covering up alleged abuse by members of their organisations or members that were known to them.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekKeating" eId="spk_650">
          <from>Deputy Derek Keating</from>
          <p eId="para_1258">Like all Members, I am appalled at the findings of the commission of investigation report into the handling by the church authorities of the abuse of children in the Catholic dioceses of Cloyne.  It makes distressing reading.  I stand beside and in support of those who have been abused in the diocese of Cloyne.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">The diocese of Cloyne is more than 800 years old, it has 46 parishes and a population of more than 160,000 people.  There are 12 religious communities working in the dioceses with approximately 140 priests.  I make this point because I wish to highlight to the House the power that one person, one bishop, has over a dioceses and how that one person in Canon Law and in practise is all-powerful.  I emphasise the point because page 33 of the report states that "as long as he operates within the canon law the bishop is free to organise the day to day running of his diocese as he sees fit".  The commission of investigation is aware that some 40 people may have been affected by clerical sexual abuse in the diocese of Cloyne.  It is unacceptable and appalling that the diocese of Cloyne never attempted to ascertain if there were other complaints involving the 19 clerics within its remit, of which 12 had a single complaint made against them.  I was also shocked to discover from the report that only one priest has been convicted of child sexual abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">Perhaps the most distressing and shocking aspect of the report, other than the abuse against children, is the fact that the then Bishop of Cloyne, Bishop Magee, lied, concealed and frustrated investigations into the abuse of children.  Effectively, this gave individual Irish bishops the freedom to ignore the procedures agreed nationally by the Irish church.  It allowed Monsignor O'Callaghan to dissent from the stated official church policy on protecting children.  Here, the conflict between Canon Law and civil law clashes.  No individual, organisation or group can act autonomously under the law here.  Yet we have seen that through Canon Law the Bishop of a diocese may decide to ignore civil law with the protection of the Holy See.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">I refer to the issue of mandatory reporting and why we must have it in this jurisdiction.  Mandatory reporting requires citizens to report all suspicions of serious crime, including child abuse.  Mandatory reporting of child abuse requires all citizens or designated professionals to report child abuse if they are aware of or suspect that child abuse exists and that a child is at risk.  However, mandatory reporting of child abuse, suspected child abuse or wilful neglect in the European Union falls into four categories.  Of the 27 member states, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom do not have mandatory reporting as of yet.  I was pleased to hear the Minister, Deputy Shatter, announce last week as part of the Government's response to the report on Cloyne a new programme to protect children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">It is interesting to note that the majority of member states have a form of mandatory reporting of child abuse and wilful neglect.  For example, Minister Paula Bennett of the New Zealand Government is currently presenting a Green Paper on child protection which will include mandatory reporting.  It is expected to be finalised in the autumn of this year.  In Ireland, some 90% of school principals have supported mandatory reporting of child abuse and wilful neglect.  More recently, Cardinal Seán Brady has called on the Government to introduce mandatory reporting in its fullest form.  The State has seen numerous reports including, the Kilkenny incest case, the Kelly Fitzgerald case, the Roscommon investigation case, the Ferns report and the Murphy report on the Dublin dioceses.  All have called for the introduction of mandatory reporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">A basic civil right for children is that they should be treated the same if not better than adults, especially if a crime is committed or suspected to have been committed against them.  They should have the full support of the State and its professionals if there is a question of abuse or wilful neglect.  Child welfare issues should not be used by social workers and other professionals to highlight the problem of child protection.  The wrong message is being sent to victims when we have one law for adults and another for children.  It is unacceptable that this is so, which is why I endorse wholeheartedly the Government's approach to dealing with this problem in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">In the last few days I have received a number of items of correspondence, some from members of the clergy, and telephone calls about the discussion on mandatory reporting.  I will not be put off my responsibility to this House and the people who sent me here.  The Government has sent a very clear statement, expressed today, deploring the Vatican's intervention which contributed to the undermining of the child protection framework and guidelines in the State.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1267">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak in this important debate on the Cloyne report.  I thank and commend Judge Yvonne Murphy, Ms Ita Mangan and Mr. Hugh O'Neill for their excellent work.  I support the all-party motion on the report and the issue of child abuse generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">In the debate it is important to sympathise with and support all of the victims and remind ourselves of the trauma they have gone through.  Sympathy is not enough, however, and words are very hollow, unless action is taken to deal with the issue of child abuse and put in place practical supports.  In the overall context of the wider debate, let us put the blame where it lies.  The leaders of the church, the State and people failed the victims.  We should never forget this.  We can have all the legislation and all of the reports we like, but they are no good if people do not act in the interests of the child and the victim.  There can be no running away from this reality and we all have a responsibility to ensure it happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">I dedicate my contribution to the protestor at the gate of Leinster House, Mr. Peter Preston, who himself was a victim of a miscarriage of justice in regard to his family.  He spends every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday protesting on the issue of child abuse and neglect, as well as the drugs issue.  I commend him for his magnificent work in carrying on his protest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">I express my dismay at the disturbing findings of the report and the inadequate and inappropriate response, particularly of the church authorities in Cloyne, to complaints and allegations of child sexual abuse.  I deplore the Vatican's intervention which contributed to the undermining of the child protection frameworks and guidelines of the State and the Irish bishops.  When I read this 421 page report and see the evidence, I wonder what is going on in this country after all the talk on child abuse and the so-called protections introduced.  The church, the State and the people did not take the necessary measures to protect children — that is the reality and it must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">My other major concern on the issue of child sexual abuse concerns the fact that there is another core group who have not been discussed in great detail, namely, children with an intellectual disability who were abused and who often have no voice.  They have been and are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse.  We will always have paedophiles in society who will look at new ways to access children and children with disabilities are a soft, open target.  Many have suffered already and my concern is that because they are forgotten, they will suffer again.  I appeal to all front-line caring staff to be vigilant and keep a close eye on all children and adults, particularly those with an intellectual disability.  I do not want to read about another Roscommon or Galway case.  Those involved in front-line services must be extra careful in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">The Cloyne report at page 351, paragraph 2, states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1273">Children have been placed at risk of harm within the Diocese of Cloyne through the inability of that Diocese to respond appropriately to the information that came to it regarding child protection concerns involving the clergy.  It failed to act effectively to limit the access to children by individuals against whom a credible complaint of child sexual abuse was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">That conclusion is the bottom line in this debate.  We have had enough talk.  We have had professional, objective and sensitive reports.  What the victims want is real action.  They deserve compassion, support and justice.  The church, the State and the people must face up to that reality and, once and for all, try to end child abuse for all children.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_654">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_1275">If this was the first report on clerical child sex abuse, it would be tragic.  The fact that it is one of many indicates the scale of the horror our society has allowed to continue for far too long.  I do not believe it is something that would be tolerated or would have happened in any other country.  It is a legacy of the privileged position of the Catholic Church and the manner in which it has been intertwined with the development of the State from the framing of the Constitution to its primary role in schools, hospitals and so on, as well as in the horrors in residential institutions as discussed last week.  That special or privileged relationship with the church is graphically shown by the all-party motion before the House.  On the one hand, it shows how far we have come, but, on the other, it shows that we have not really moved at all.  The fact that the original wording was changed from "condemns the actions of the Vatican" to "deplores the actions of the Vatican" sums up the situation in which we find ourselves.  I do not just deplore what happened.  In the dictionary the meaning of "deplore" is to regret deeply.  The feelings of people in this country go way beyond regretting deeply.  They are absolutely outraged at what has been allowed to happen.  If these actions had been taken in any other country, there is no question but that it would have been deemed to be a hostile act.  If the Libyan ambassador behaved in the same way as the papal nuncio, there would almost be calls for the Army to assemble at the Libyan border.  The reality is that, between the Murphy and Cloyne reports, the Vatican was a party to a criminal conspiracy to prevent the Irish authorities from being informed in a timely fashion of reported cases of abuse.  The refusal of the Papal Nuncio to respond to questions is an affront to victims and Irish society at large.  As other Deputies have said, at a very minimum, he should have been expelled.  One wonders what it would take to have some people here condemn the actions of the church if the revelations in the Cloyne report are not enough for them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">It is clear that words are inadequate to describe the harm inflicted on children abused by the clergy.  I express my own and my party's solidarity with the victims and commend them for their bravery in stepping forward and telling their stories to the commission.  The fact that these crimes were perpetrated after 1996, by which time the church was supposed to have child protection measures in place in the aftermath of the Brendan Smyth case, goes to the heart of the matter and demonstrates that the public repentance of the church hierarchy cannot be trusted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">This is the most serious incident to date and the lack of prosecutions post the Murphy report means many do not have huge confidence that justice will be meted out to the perpetrators mentioned in the Cloyne report either.  This is an issue for which the Minister must account.  Much funding has been expended on these reports but very few have been brought to justice.  We need to see action in this regard.  Obviously, the State is also hugely culpable and while it is very convenient to allow the church to take the blame, it must step up to the mark also.  Unless there is full separation of church and State, these issues will never be adequately addressed.</p>

        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_655">
          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_1278">I would like to step back in time a little to the Ireland of the 1970s.  A young man enters a seminary; the priestly vocation is a challenging one and, accordingly, in 1978 the young man goes for a psychological assessment which does not go well.  There is an indication of deep sexual repression and he scores very high on the psychosis scale.  However, no obstacles are put in his path.  He is ordained and joins a parish in north Cork in the mid-1980s.  We will call him Fr. Calder which is not his real name.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">People became worried almost immediately.  In 1988, a young man alleged a sexual assault but did not make a formal complaint.  There were reports that Fr. Calder had been giving alcohol to young adults and spiking their drinks.  Another report of sexual abuse was made but again no formal complaint followed.  Fr. Calder then moved to another parish in Cork where another "soft" complaint of sexual abuse was made.  In July 1997, the diocese announced that Fr. Calder was to move to a new parish in north Cork beside the one in which he started his career.  However, the locals there did not want him near their children and they mounted a campaign.  The diocese made some inquiries, asked Fr. Calder about the allegations, which he denied, and the transfer went ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">Almost immediately, Fr. Calder was appointed chairman of the board of management of the local national school.  The principal was concerned for the safety of the children in her school but was unable to do anything or bring it to the attention of the board of management because Fr. Calder was its chairman.  There had previously been a custom in the school of letting boys leave school during the day to serve as altar boys for daily mass.  The principal had stopped this practice some time previously but her new chairman, Fr. Calder, now asked her to start letting the boys out again and moreover, he asked that they come to him for altar boy training during school time.  The principal, out of concern for their safety, refused.  Was Fr. Calder embarrassed, uncomfortable or ashamed?  No, he threatened her and stated that effectively, he could withhold her salary unless she did what he asked.  Finally, the diocese launched an investigation into Fr. Calder.  In October 1997, he was sent for assessment to the Granada Institute, where he was unco-operative.</p>

          <p eId="para_1282">What happened?  He was neither defrocked nor stripped of his right to practice as a priest.  Instead, he returned to ministry, albeit this time to an old folks' home, and further reports then ensued.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">This story is at the heart of the Cloyne report.  A possibly abusive priest was placed in a position with access to children and with authority over the school principal.  When the church finally took note of the concerns about the priest, it apparently launched an inquiry but the Cloyne report implies the documents may be deliberately inaccurate.  The priest was moved but not supervised and Bishop Magee made no attempt to monitor his progress.  A report was made to the Vatican but nothing has been heard of it since.  This organisation controls 93% of primary schools in Ireland.  This organisation actively discriminates against children who do not belong to it from joining the State schools it controls.  There is a problem in this regard.  It is not simply about secularisation or multiculturalism but is about care for our children.  I believe in the value of faith formation.  However, the Catholic Church has proved it is absolutely unfit and absolutely not competent to run our schools.  It is time for it to remove itself or be removed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1286">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  What has happened in the context of Cloyne is appalling.  It is immoral, illegal and disgusting and during this week, more of this spin, this language and these questions have emanated from people who are at the centre of the report.  I refer in particular to Monsignor Denis O'Callaghan, who is a former chairman of County Cork VEC.  He served on boards of management and was involved in an authority that educates young children in County Cork.  There was zero accountability from that man this week and when it was put to him by a reporter that he had failed the victims of this abuse, he had the temerity and cheek to ask in what way.  That is damned brazen, to say the least.  Moreover, no account has been given of Bishop John Magee's whereabouts.  Allegedly, he could be in Rome or in America.  Is one honestly expected to believe that people involved in that organisation do not know where he is?</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">I find it equally appalling that the Vatican would meddle in affairs of the Irish State.  Deputy Clare Daly was quite correct to state that had it been any other ambassador, he or she would have been expelled.  This is an option the Government should consider.  One should note that although guidelines were established in the wake of the horrific abuse perpetrated by Fr. Brendan Smyth, people like Monsignor O'Callaghan did not believe in them.  Moreover, he openly admits to not having any faith in the aforementioned guidelines and did not consider it necessary to pass on details of abuse to members of An Garda Síochána.  It is critical that Members bear in mind the timeframe in this regard.  These are not atrocities one can consign to the 1950s, 1960s or the 1970s as the period under investigation extends from 1996 to 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">One should note that the church authorities in the present era are still fumbling when it comes to this issue, to put it mildly, and that this is the fourth major clerical abuse inquiry to take place in Ireland.  An absolutely disturbing aspect of this report is that it is patently clear that church authorities appear to have learned nothing from previous reports.  On foot of the Murphy report, the papal nuncio stated that the Vatican was ashamed of its findings and that he would undertake to assist in the forthcoming report into the diocese of Cloyne.  He and the Vatican did so by doing their level best to obstruct it.  Judge Yvonne Murphy has proved the nuncio's statement to be absolutely and utterly redundant.  She has accused the Holy See of being "entirely unhelpful" in its reaction to inquiries from the commission.  As Judge Murphy has concluded the Vatican was unhelpful despite a commitment given by the papal nuncio to the effect that it would assist in the investigation into abuse, I believe it is a resigning matter for him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">It is important to stress that the report was not an investigation into allegations of child sexual abuse but rather a report into how allegations made in Cloyne were handled after January 1996.  In that vein, the report has singled out Bishop John Magee, who was a personal secretary to three Popes, for misleading inquiries into the mishandling of abuse claims.  The report concluded that Rome effectively gave Bishop Magee <i>carte blanche</i> to ignore guidelines and offer comfort and support to senior clerics such as Monsignor Denis O’Callaghan who defied official policy on paedophile priests and did not believe they should be reported to the authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">One aspect of this abhorrent case is that Monsignor O'Callaghan refers to survivors of this abuse as "accusers", almost as though their claims were spurious and without foundation.  That man, who was the delegate of Bishop John Magee, has contributed singularly to the hurt and pain of the survivors of this abuse.  Moreover, this man contributes to the ongoing pain and hurt of those who have been victimised and abused by paedophile priests.  I echo the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach, who eloquently spoke in this Chamber this afternoon about this ugly and disgusting saga of Irish history.  I also agree with the Tánaiste's comment that what has happened was totally inappropriate and unjustified and constituted an unacceptable intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">I welcome the plans proposed by the Minister for Justice and Equality to jail for up to five years any priest who fails to disclose information on serious offences against a child.  I also welcome confirmation from Garda assistant commissioner Derek Byrne that the Children First guidelines will be incorporated into Garda training.  While the findings of the Cloyne report are abhorrent, it singles out the individuals who were responsible and who continue to contribute to the hurt and suffering experienced by victims.  It goes against the teachings of the Gospel and of Jesus Christ and these people are nothing short of being outright criminals.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</from>
          <p eId="para_1292">I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality for the prompt manner in which he has published this unfortunate report.  I am sure that any new Minister in that portfolio would have gained some relief during the early months of his or her tenure from not being obliged to deal with this subject matter.  However, it is part of our history and thanks to the report by the commission, is now public knowledge.  I also wish to mention the commission's members, namely, Judge Yvonne Murphy, Ms Ita Mangan and Mr. Hugh O'Neill for the valuable work they have done.  More importantly, I wish to single out those mentioned in the report who have been hurt the most, that is, the victims who have suffered in isolation.  I pay homage to them and to their bravery in coming forward to co-operate with this commission as it has not been an easy decision for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">Human beings have inflicted different types of cruelty on children.  Cruelty can take different forms such as the denial of food, bullying or lack of adequate clothing.  These are examples of the neglect of children by adults.  However, there is no more horrible crime against children than sexual abuse and this is what some members of the clerical orders of the Roman Catholic Church engaged in over a long period of time in this country.  Other speakers referred to other various reports in this regard.  It is part and parcel of the hidden Ireland and, as the previous speaker said, has been happening in more recent times.  The church has many questions to answer.  People are angry with the church and rightly so.  Those who committed the crimes and those in the church who knew but who said nothing are all guilty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">Previous speakers have referred to the church and the State.  I seldom use the word "state" because of what was happening during the period since our independence.  The church failed these children and so did politicians.  The Roman Catholic Church had a special position in this State and it used it.  A very few in this House questioned the authority and the rule of the Roman Catholic Church but they paid a great price and one or two notable people spoke out to their cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">I refer to an interesting example of an individual speaking out on a "Late Late Show" 44 years ago in 1967.  An unknown person who was a member of a movement called Reform was invited onto the guest panel.  His name was Frank Crummey — he is still alive, in his 70s and I am honoured to say he is my neighbour and a good friend.  During the panel discussion Frank stated that as the panel members were sitting in the studio, children in institutions in Ireland were being abused.  He paid a big price for his statement.  Apart from the fact that he was heckled and could not continue, he was almost physically attacked during the break in the programme.  It did not end there.  His children were ostracised at school on the following days and he was spat upon in public.  Frank Crummey was the first man to state publicly that abuse of children was taking place and that politicians and the church should deal with it.  Let us hope this is the end of this and that this report is the last report.</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_1296">I join with other speakers in supporting the motion and I commend all parties for agreeing the motion.  Like others, I deplore the Vatican's intervention which contributed to the undermining of the child protection frameworks and guidelines of the Irish State and of Irish bishops.  I further concur with the condemnation of the inadequate and inappropriate response of, in particular, the church authorities in Cloyne, to complaints and allegations of child sex abuse.  I understand the frustration and anger of many people with regard to these matters.  I can empathise with the call for the expulsion of the papal nuncio.  However, it is this line of communication which must be continued to be used and which must be continued in our efforts to demand answers from the Vatican.  I also compliment Judge Murphy and her colleagues on the commission for their sterling work in this regard.  I compliment the victims for their courage and fortitude, for the initial telling of their abuse and their subsequent dealings with those in authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">I refer to a statement in a newspaper today from Derek Mulligan who is connected to the case in Donegal.  I note the eloquent manner in which he described his feelings and the consternation caused in his life before he came forward with details of his own abuse:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1298">I carried this cross on my back for 12 years, unable to forgive myself for what this demon did to me.  He took my soul, my faith and my heart.  He also haunted my dreams.  I was unable to love.  I was scared of everyone and everything.  I kept running from place to place, Dublin to Spain to Letterkenny and to Derry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">This is a snapshot of the hurt and pain and the feelings of many young people throughout the country and specifically of those we talk about today and we commend them for their part in bringing forward this report and in bringing forward what will be a new direction for the State in imposing the will of the people and the will of this House as to how these matters are dealt with in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">I commend the initial response of the Government and I commend the programme for dealing with this issue.  I commend the movement from voluntary reporting to that of mandatory reporting.  However, I ask what measures will be put in place to augment this policy.  Examples from other jurisdictions show that the move from voluntary to mandatory reporting results in a significant increase in the number of reports.  I refer to the example of New South Wales in Australia which in 1998 adopted a policy of mandatory reporting instead of voluntary reporting.  Thirty thousand cases were reported in 1998 and in 2008 the figure was 180,000 cases reported.  There had been a sixfold increase in a ten-year period.  The number of social workers was doubled from 1,000 to 2,000 on the day mandatory reporting was introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">In Ireland today, between 5% and 10% of children in the care of the State do not have an assigned social worker.  There is already pressure on our system and this is before putting in place the correct facilities, implementation plan, funding and personnel.  We should take lessons from the Ryan report which was issued two years' ago.  It dealt with abuse in residential institutions.  The subsequent implementation plan was accompanied by funding of €24 million.  The plan provided for the provision of 270 new social workers.  A total of 200 have been employed but 70 are still required in that area.  In addition to the percentage of children who do not have an assigned social worker or care assistant, there is a deficit of 70 social workers for those affected by the Ryan report.  These are further strains and further pressures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">What assessments have been carried out by the relevant Departments of the move from voluntary to mandatory reporting?  What provisions are consequent to that assessment?  What funding or personnel can be provided in order to ensure the success of the plan?  Will the Government publish any assessments which have been carried out?  Can we scrutinise them and ensure adequate resources are being provided?  If it has not been carried out can the Government commit to carrying it out forthwith?  Can it commit to augmenting it with the relevant funds and personnel to assure our people that these children can be assured of the sort of care that is required further to the publication and further to the distress heaped upon them?</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">I commend the strength, depth and quality of debate that has been forthcoming from all sides of the House today.  I commend the Government on its initial reaction and for its goodwill, good faith and commitment to introduce the sorts of measures that will prevent issues such as this from arising again.  However, in the recent Donegal case there was reporting and the HSE and Garda were informed and yet it still persisted.  We are at a major juncture in the history of the State in this regard.  The Members of this House can have a significant impact on how we deal with these issues in the future and we must deal with them correctly.  Every effort should be made to ensure that the provisions and steps being discussed are followed through, not only by means of words and reporting, but we also need the support system in place to coincide with that report.  I refer to a support system in the area of funding and in personnel and then we will be able to address all the issues that have arisen in Dublin, Cloyne and Donegal.  Despite the drip-feed of this terrible saga in the past 20 years, the Cloyne report refers to 2008 and the Donegal case refers to the present day.  Reporting is not enough without the relevant funding and personnel in place to augment and support it.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
          <p eId="para_1304">It is important that we together declare our determination in one voice, clear and unequivocal, to stand with the nation in seeking to safeguard our children.  We have done that today by the adoption of an all-party motion in this House.  I welcome that and I express my appreciation for the all-party support in the range of contributions here today.  For our part and on behalf of the Government, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and I are acting with an urgency and absolute determination to bring forward a programme of firm actions to strengthen our nation's child protection framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">I commend the bravery of all those individuals who came forward and told the commission of their experiences.  Without their crucial input we would not have a report of such detail and quality.  I appreciate that events of this nature can cause painful memories to resurface.  For any person affected by the report's content I wish to repeat that help is available and join the Minister, Deputy Shatter, in expressing our sincere apologies for any failings of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">For all of us last week is one that we would love to forget, but must always remember.  This is not the first investigation into the handling of allegations of child abuse by church authorities, but is one of many.  However, unlike previous reports, the Cloyne report showed us that child abuse and endangerment is not something that happened back in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s or 1980s.  The report showed us that child abuse and endangerment can happen and is still happening today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">Chapter 27 of the report goes into some detail about the experiences of the victims of clerical abuse.  It is the last chapter and has a simple and almost bureaucratic title: "The Complainants".  It contains the evidence of what happens to little children when child protection guidelines are declared by the Vatican to be nothing more than "study documents".  While the study continued, so did the abuse.  Chapter 27 quotes the adults those little children become.  The Complainants is a chapter largely made up of their words, which I wish to put on the record of the House.  One comment was: "my mother reared five children, how did she get one so different.  I am like a shadow."  Another comment was: "Separate instances.  They all mulch into one, one long brain turning, nauseating role of events."  Yet another comment was: "what was so awful about all of this all of my life is I felt that I was the one who did something dreadful, that I was the one so isolated in shame until I knew better, you know, and that is exactly what he wanted."</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">Over the past few days we have heard additional commentary from individuals affected by clerical child abuse in the Cloyne diocese and their families.  It is heartbreaking to hear of normal lives being thrown so far off course that some of those affected have never experienced the stability we all yearn for in our lives.  Modest goals such as relationships, family and employment eluded people who just could not cope.  Some individuals have taken many years to rebuild their lives.  Some, tragically, never recovered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">The publication last week of the Cloyne report has generated significant public anger and concern as was reflected in the contributions here today.  However, reports since then of cases in Galway and Donegal have further heightened that anger and concern — and rightly so.  We owe it to our children to ensure that whether in the family home, at school, in church or in engaging in any other activities, formally or informally, they are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">The Government must be assured that all legal and practical measures are being taken to guarantee this.  On behalf of the Government and in conjunction with my colleague the Minister, Deputy Shatter, we are engaged in a series of measures designed to achieve this.  As the Minister outlined to the House, he has published the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes against Children and Intellectually Disabled Persons) Bill 2011.  Last week I published the Children First National Guidance 2011.  It provides a robust code for the protection and welfare of children offering clear direction to individuals, organisations and agencies on what they need to do to keep children safe.  I urge people and organisations to familiarise themselves with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">In recognition of the importance of Children First, the HSE will publish an associated child protection and welfare practice handbook, which will be very helpful for front-line professionals.  These two publications will provide clearer direction and support to front-line staff and organisations working with children.  They will also set out the respective roles of the statutory agencies responsible for child protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">Last week I received Government agreement to introduce legislation to require, for the first time, statutory compliance with Children First.  This will include a statutory requirement on individuals to report to the relevant authorities where, in good faith, they have reasonable concerns over the abuse or neglect of a child.  However, the scope of Children First extends beyond the narrow focus of reporting on its own.  We do not want to create simply a reporting culture and nothing else because protecting children involves more than making a once-off report.  Instead, through requiring statutory compliance with Children First, I propose a much broader-based and comprehensive approach to child protection laying down the broader responsibilities of organisations that are in contact with or providing services to children.  This will include a requirement regarding the sharing of information, which is so important if we are to protect children.  The need for such requirement was proven again this week on foot of reports of the Donegal case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">Last week, we learned of the shocking inadequate and inappropriate response by the diocese of Cloyne, to complaints and allegations of child sexual abuse in the period from between 1996 and 2008.  The diocese did not comply with the church guidelines, nor did it comply with Children First.  It is therefore vital that guidance translates into implementation on the ground.  We must have compliance without exception or exemptions.  Never again should someone be allowed to place the protection of the institution or organisation above the protection of children.  As I stated last week, the days of voluntary compliance are over when it comes to child protection.  The new legislation I will introduce will provide for a strong system of inspection and oversight.  On the need to provide demonstrable evidence that the guidance is being implemented correctly across all sectors, we will also have what is called an assurance framework, an assurance setting out the responsibilities of each Department and sector working with children and it will be implemented.   I will chair an interdepartmental committee in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">We need capacity in our child protection services, but it is equally important that we focus on appropriate management, consistency of response and the creation of a world class model of child protection, as stated by Mr. Gordon Jeyes, the new director of the HSE's child and family services section.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">Yesterday, I laid before the Houses the second progress report on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Ryan report implementation plan.  Putting Children First on a statutory footing was a key recommendation of the Ryan report.  As to those Deputies who raised doubts in this regard, this is the policy of the Government and every political party in the House.  Although it was promised by the previous Government in 1999, it is being done only now.  The proposed recruitment of 270 additional social workers will go ahead.  These posts are exempt from the public service recruitment embargo and 260 of them will have been filled by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">The Department of Justice and Equality, with some support from my Department, is close to completing its work on the vetting legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">The report's principal findings cast cold light over the practices of church authorities in the diocese of Cloyne.  It is particularly disappointing that the diocese did not as a matter of course report and notify allegations and concerns to the statutory authorities.  This would have been in keeping with State guidelines and the reporting procedures adopted by the church.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">For those who reported painful and horrific episodes in their lives in the expectation that some positive action would be taken by the diocese, I cannot imagine the sense of disappointment and anger at what can be only seen as the inaction of the church authorities in Cloyne.  The initial surprise response yesterday from a Vatican spokesman, whether in a personal capacity or not, has not helped.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">The church in particular must fully engage with the outcome of and responses to the Cloyne report.  Last week, I called for a decisive shift to a culture of transparency and public accountability.  In particular, I called for the publication by the National Board for Safeguarding Children of the audit of each diocese it undertakes and for acceleration in its conduct of all such audits.  I note and welcome that Archbishop Diarmuid Martin has joined in my call to publish the diocesan reviews by the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">I will soon be in receipt of the long awaited report of the HSE audit of child protection in Roman Catholic dioceses, which should indicate whether all allegations known to church authorities are being properly reported to the State authorities, namely, the Garda and the HSE.  In the meantime, I have asked the HSE's national director for children and family services, Mr. Jeyes, to engage directly with the National Board for Safeguarding Children on a programme of action designed to ensure that the Catholic church is responding properly and comprehensively to all child protection concerns.  Mr. Jeyes has already made contact with the board in this regard and will report to me on the progress achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">I commend all those who already work so hard to ensure every child with whom they interact is cared for, supported and protected.  These are the practitioners in the professional and voluntary sectors, medical professionals, gardaí, youth workers, teachers and coaches all over Ireland who already passionately employ best practice in child protection.  They understand their duties and do not need legislation to keep children safe.  As the reports recount, though, there are those who do not make child protection their prime objective, whether by omission or commission, out of ignorance or malice.  We are introducing new laws to use the State's powers of prosecution to protect our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">Although we will introduce laws, it takes a community to protect a child, as evidenced by recent cases.  The measures proposed by the Government will, with Opposition input and support, cumulatively leave a lasting legacy when it comes to child protection by putting in place laws, practices and mechanisms to ensure the evils highlighted in cases such as Cloyne and other cases are never again allowed to take root in any setting.</p>

          <p eId="para_1328">I regret I cannot take on board the Deputy's amendment.  I will reiterate some points we have already discussed about the Bill's origins.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">Under section 11 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, is statutorily independent in the exercise of its functions.  A regulator independent of postal service providers is an explicit requirement of article 22 of the directive.  Where member states retain ownership or control of postal service providers, the effective structural separation of regulatory functions from activities associated with ownership or control is required.  Since the post office is in State hands, it is a requirement that we must separate regulation from ownership.  For this reason, I cannot have conferred on me power to overrule the regulator in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">I understand that an issue aired in the debate in the Seanad and on Committee Stage in the Dáil concerned the perception of a lack of accountability by ComReg to the Houses.  I assure Deputies that the 2002 Act, which established ComReg as an independent statutory body to regulate and take key decisions on the electronic communications and postal sectors, also provides in section 34 that ComReg is accountable to the Oireachtas concerning the performance of its functions.  Where it is strategically necessary, the Act allows the Minister to issue policy directions to the regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">As I stated last week, the proposed amendment would create uncertainty around ComReg's operations and could compromise its independence.  ComReg's statutory functions and objectives, as amended by sections 9 and 10, respectively, of the Bill, require it "to ensure the provision of a universal postal service that meets the reasonable needs of postal service users".  Thus, any decision taken by ComReg must take account of the reasonable needs and interests of postal service users.  Under the Bill, the regulator's decisions on postal services can be appealed to the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">Deputies will have noticed that a Government amendment to section 17 tabled and agreed to on Committee Stage provided that certain decisions made by ComReg relating to the designation of a universal service provider would be subject to the Minister's consent.  I hope this gives Deputy Martin Ferris some comfort in terms of what he is trying to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_1335">Deputy Ferris only proposed that, when it was in the national interest, the Minister could intervene.  He did not propose the Minister would intervene willy-nilly.  It would only happen when it was in the national interest.  It would have to be an issue of overriding national interest and it could not be in the interest of An Post.  The argument, therefore, that this is impossible because the regulator is independent is untenable.  The Bill is full of provisions where the Minister's consent is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">The only way ComReg can be brought to heel by the House if it disagrees with what ComReg does is by changing the law.  We can ask ComReg to appear in committees and we can debate with it forever.  If ComReg then decides to ignore us, it can and there is no sanction.  The only sanction on ComReg is that we change the law or allow for cases where the Minister's consent or direction is needed.  That is how simple this is.  Many of us have experienced bodies that come in for meetings and give an account of what they are doing but we have little influence on what they do because they can do what they want.</p>

          <p eId="para_1341">I will not delay the House because we are going round in a circle with this Bill.  This amendment seeks to ensure the commission, otherwise known as ComReg, takes into account in all its decisions the value of the post offices and the nature of the country we are legislating for, and that it would not make decisions that would jeopardise that fabric.  It is important to provide for that in the Bill.  We cannot over-emphasise the need, in the national interest, to try to direct ComReg from this House in the direction we see fit.  Most people believe that for the vulnerable in society especially, those who do not use digital media, the post office is an important service and that should be taken into account in all decisions made by the commission.</p>

          <p eId="para_1343">I also support this amendment.  Last night there were references to the Dutch postal services, with someone mentioning there had not been deregulation.  The Minister said yesterday that we are all afraid of competition but postal workers have a right to be afraid of competition judging by an article on the Dutch postal service in <i>The Guardian</i> on 29 April:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1344">Somewhere in the Netherlands, a postwoman is in trouble.  When I visited her, bad health, snow and ice and a degree of chaos in her personal life had left her months behind on her deliveries.  She rents a privatised ex-council flat with her partner and so many crates of mail had built up that it was getting hard to move around.  Twice a week one of the private mail companies she was working for, Selektmail, dropped off three or four crates of letters, magazines and catalogues.  She was sorting and delivering the fresh crates but the winter backlog was tough to clear.  I counted 62 full mail crates stacked up in the hallway [...] The postwoman had a similar problem with the other private mail company she works for, Sandd, a few years back.  "When I began at Sandd in 2006, I delivered about 14 boxes of mail every time," she said.  "I could not cope and at Christmas 2006 I had about 90 of these boxes in the house.  By New Year's Day we had 97." [...] Each week, Dutch households and businesses are visited by postmen and postwomen from four different companies.  There are the "orange" postmen of the privatised Dutch mail company, trading as TNT Post but about to change its name to PostNL; the "blue" postmen of Sandd, a private Dutch firm; the "yellow" postmen of Selekt, owned by Deutsche Post/DHL; and the "half-orange" postmen of Netwerk VSP, set up by TNT to compete cannibalistically against itself by using casual labour that is cheaper than its own (unionised) workforce.  TNT delivers six days a week, Sandd and Selekt two, and VSP one.  From the point of view of an ardent free-marketeer, this sounds like healthy competition.  Curiously, however, none of the competitors is prospering.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">The article outlines how many workers are sorting the mail in their apartments on their beds and that, curiously, when such backlogs build up, there is no system for complaints about delayed mail.  That is why postal workers are fearful of competition and that is why I fully support the amendment.  The Minister should take this on.  It is not about trying to protect a corner.  It is about providing proper, regulated and safe conditions and that postmen and women are provided with proper gear for the weather.  These workers get a bag and a jacket and that is all.  We should take this more seriously.</p>

          <p eId="para_1346">I agree with the spirit of the amendments but I am advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that there is no requirement or necessity to put this into primary legislation because the cornerstone of the Bill is the universal service obligation, which is the real tacit recognition of the importance of the role of the postal service.  I fully acknowledge the social function of the postal service and agree with it.  The postal network is not affected by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">Deputy Ó Cuív cannot argue that his Government introduced a regulator for the postal service, the electronic communication service or the energy service and then say the Government can overrule those regulators when it feels like it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_1349">The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  Either we set up a statutorily independent regulator or we do not.  The requirement behind this is that An Post is a State-owned postal company and we must separate regulation from ownership.  Either he accepts that basic principle or not but he cannot argue for both sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">I accept the importance of the social role of the postal service in Ireland.  As Deputy Ferris said, it was the subject of much debate during the evolution of this Bill and on Committee Stage.  Of course I recognise the important role of the postal service in this country and I accept the spirit of the amendments.  I would point out to Deputy Ó Cuív, however, that the post office network does not fall within the remit of the postal directive and is not affected by the provisions of the Bill.  I am sure the Deputy will be glad to hear that section 12 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 is remaining unchanged.  An Post will continue to be statutorily obliged to provide nationwide counter services both for its own business and that of the Government.  That has not changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">The social importance of a universal postal service is encapsulated in the universal service obligation, the essential element of which is the collection and delivery of mail to every home and premises in every corner of the State on every working day.  This key principle is enshrined in the Bill, which designates An Post as the universal postal service provider.  Designating An Post offers certainty to postal service users and the universal service obligation will be met throughout the country with no urban-rural divide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">In addition, ComReg, as the postal services regulator, is charged with ensuring the provision of a universal postal service that meets the reasonable needs of users.  Deputies will be aware that the Bill augments the functions and objectives of ComReg to promote the development of the sector, to promote the interests of users and, subject to these two objectives, to facilitate the development of competition and innovation in the market.  These are not equal objectives and I believe this hierarchy of objectives adequately addresses the concerns Deputy Ferris is seeking to address in this amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_677">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_1353">When the Minister talks about an independent regulator, is he referring to one that is totally independent of direction either from the Oireachtas or the Minister?  Unless we change the law, it is independent of the Oireachtas and that is why I have very little faith in this so-called accountability to the Oireachtas.  It is true to say, however, that this Bill is full of cases where the Minister's permission is needed and therefore this independence is not absolute.  The idea that An Post or the regulator can do what they want is clearly constrained by the Bill.  Presumably the Minister's officials have advised him this is all kosher.  The simple question then arises as to when the Minister should have the right to intervene, because it is clearly stated in the sections every time the Minister's consent is needed.  How far should the Minister retain control and over what?</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">All that Deputy Ferris suggested, and I support him, is that where the national interest is involved — not An Post's interests — the Minister should step in.  That is what was proposed.  To rubbish that means the Minister thinks ComReg's independence is more important than the national interest.  The Minister has made his point and so be it.  We have clearly heard where he stands on that issue.  It is his decision and we will remember it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">The Minister said this does not affect post offices but of course it does, although it is not directly related to them.  It is like saying that if the wall falls down it does not necessarily bring the window with it.  If An Post loses the universal service in future, the post offices will follow.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_1356">The spirit and principle of my amendment are to protect the postal service indefinitely.  That is the reason I have tabled the amendment.  We either have faith in politics or we do not.  In his reply, the Minister said ComReg will protect the service in future, but I would dispute that.  What we have seen from past regulation in other spheres has certainly not been in the national interest.  It is so important that a service which is provided in the national interest continues to operate as such.  We can be proud of the postal service that has been consistently provided across this island.  I have major worries going forward, despite the fact that, as was stated yesterday, ComReg can continue for a further 12 to 20 years.  I do not believe that to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">I am not pointing the finger at the Minister in any way, but this Bill is all about the liberalisation of the postal service and its privatisation in the long term.  That will be a huge disadvantage to people who are most in need of the service, including those living in isolated areas who are dependent on that social contact.  Effectively, privatisation or liberalisation is all about profit before anything else.  Therefore any protections we can insert in the legislation to assure postal workers, as well as the recipients of the service, need to be taken on board.  I would like the Minister to reconsider the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1358">I have listened to much of this debate because I have considerable concerns about the postal service.  I agree with the Minister that the main threat to the service comes from email and other electronic forms of communication.  I have sought assurances on a number of aspects of the legislation, but I wish to read into the record one such aspect.  There are provisions in the legislation dealing with an industrial levy which are designed to ensure that if there is cherry-picking of profitable routes and An Post — as the universal postal service provider — is left with the unprofitable ones, it will be compensated by way of contributions from the profitable commercial sector.  That is an important aspect of this Bill.  The Minister has done his best to protect An Post and our postal services generally.  It is important that should be done and I entirely accept the importance of having a good postal service for the country.  I also acknowledge the social aspects that Deputies Ferris and Ó Cuív have mentioned, but it is not simply a straightforward liberalisation of the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_1359">I agree with Deputy Ferris that the service provided by An Post across the country is very important and is appreciated by the people of Ireland.  I have no doubt about that.  The universal service obligation enshrined in this legislation will protect that important aspect of An Post.  Deputy Joan Collins quoted an example from Holland, but I have no intention — neither does the Government — of privatising An Post.  It will not happen while this Government is in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">Deputy Ó Cuív states that the law is not absolute, and of course he is right.  The Minister has reserved rights under the legislation to give a policy direction if he or she thinks it is appropriate to do so.  It is entirely proper that the Minister should reserve that right, but it can be only exercised consistent with the law.  Deputy Ó Cuív asks how I can argue that there is absolute independence while the Minister's consent is called for, but he has been advocating that the Minister's consent be enshrined in the Bill since we started the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1362">I have made a number of concessions to him to put into the Bill where the Minister's express consent is required, for example, if there was any question of ComReg trying to shut down the universal service obligation after seven years.  This was the situation in the Bill when I inherited it from Deputy Ó Cuív's party.  The Minister can intervene and say "Sorry, we are not wearing that."</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">The protection of the service is one of the objectives of ComReg under the law.  Given that it has been regulated since 2000, why has no decision of ComReg ever been challenged?  It has consistently protected the universal service obligation.  I am aware of people in An Post who think that the imposition on them to deliver the mail every day to every house in the country as required can be extremely costly and extremely severe, but they do it because ComReg insists they do it.  That is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">I accept the spirit of the amendments, but it is carefully provided for in the legislation.  As Deputy Dowds said, in so far as one can do it in law, it is in law.  That will continue and it is not the intention of this Government to privatise the post office.  Whatever threat there is to postal services and to future employment in the post offices, it comes from matters other than this Bill, such as the pervasive electronic substitution.</p>

Why is there a provision that the universal service obligation can be reduced from 20 kg to 10 kg?  I just do not get it.  Perhaps the Minister can explain why he is not willing to delete this and insist on the 20 kg figure.  It is a black and white issue.  I have no good explanation for this other than to assume that this is unnecessary creeping liberalisation.  The Minister said he is all for keeping An Post as a universal service operator, but I do not think this Bill will do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">I am interested in hearing that An Post would like to get out of this area, because it shows us that even within the citadel, there are people who think it is too onerous to go to every house every day.   That will become much more vociferous as the good parts of the market are taken away.  An Post management will keep coming back and say that mail is declining and it is not profitable any more, and that the good parts of the market in Dublin 2 and Dublin 4 are gone.  The Government will try to levy the private sector but it will not be paid, as we saw with the VHI.  The pressure will come on ComReg and it will be said that it is ridiculous to go to a house every day if there is no piece of mail every day.  Then the service will begin to diminish step by step.  That is the scenario and the Minister is adding to this by reducing the service obligation from 20 kg to 10 kg.  It is very simple; he just needs to remove those parts from the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1372">I declare an interest in this.  I am the local post master in our small village and that is why I fully appreciate and value the excellent service provided over the years in rural areas.  I remember Deputy Harrington giving a very eloquent speech on rural post offices one evening in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">I fully accept the Minister's bona fides and that he may not think that this is what will result, but I am afraid that if this is opened up and others come in to cherrypick, they will not understand that the service as carried out in the past was more than just delivering mail and was more than just a business.  An Post and the postal people who ran our post offices over the years are like social workers.  It might seem like a miserable letter to some people, but the act of going to meet a person in a rural location is more than just delivering the mail.  The postman might inform the person about who died that week, tell a bit of gossip, or have a debate about politics or football.  If that kind of social interaction is taken away in the future, then it is another death knell to rural Ireland.  It is losing something that we have cherished and appreciated.  That is why I am concerned about the content of this Bill and that is why I put forward an amendment and support other amendments in the same area.  They are in the interests of rural Ireland.  I am not saying for one minute that the Minister does not have the interests of rural Ireland in his heart as well, because I know that he does.  I just have a deep concern about this, as someone who worked in the post office and who knows how important the service is to people in rural locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">Loneliness is an awful problem in rural areas, and the postman calling and delivering the mail really means so much to people.  As everything has become so money orientated, I could see people in the future saying that it does not make financial sense to deliver one letter to a person at the end of a long road.  It might not make financial sense, but from a human point of view, it makes great sense and it might mean so much to that person.  That is why I am worried about cherrypicking in the future and is why I wanted to voice my concerns.  However, I am not trying to say that the Minister is the big bad wolf putting something through against the people, because that would not be the case.  I certainly hope that my heartfelt views will be taken on board in this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1375">Dutch mail is privatised and liberalised to a point where private companies can bring their mail to a delivery area, where it is then delivered by the workers.  However, we are missing the point on cherrypicking.  The Minister said that nobody wants competition.  The reason we do not want competition is there for all to see right across Europe.  The US does not allow private mail companies to work in their states as it is a public service.  It is not a question of the profitable parts subsidising the unprofitable areas for An Post.  It is a question of jobs being lost, what companies are picking up those jobs and the conditions those jobs entail.  We have seen it happen in private companies in England and elsewhere throughout Europe where a postal worker is given a jacket and a satchel and paid much less than the postal worker employed by the State who has good conditions, reasonable pay, a pension to which to look forward and with the security of steady job he or she can possibly afford to go to a bank in the future to put a down payment on a house and take out a mortgage.  That is what is being lost here.  The security associated with being employed in a huge State body is being lost and that will have an impact.  All the money in the world that is provided by a private company that has chosen to deliver a service in Dublin 4, in the inner city area where all the offices are based or in a high residential area will not save those jobs.  That is why this Bill must be rejected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">In certain circumstances, we can bring this case to Europe and point out that this is not what we need here at this time.  I am sure something can be done in that respect.  The Bill must be opposed.  I cannot accept the Minister's arguments in this respect.</p>

The universal service obligation remains and we do not intend to go down the privatisation route.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378">I do not dispute what Deputy Healy-Rae said.  We had that discussion with Deputies Ferris and Ó Cuív who drew attention during the course of the debate to the importance of the postal service, especially in rural Ireland.  Deputy Healy-Rae is right in that the postman calling to a house can certainly be an occasion in the day for people who are isolated.  As he put it, the postman is a kind of a social worker.  Deputy Ferris had him collecting the messages and bringing them to the person in an isolated community.</p>

          <p eId="para_1380">I accept there is a social dimension, interaction, gossip and all the rest associated with the postman when he calls.  I acknowledge all of that but the postman's job is to deliver the post, not to be a social worker or to collect the messages.  If he can do all those things as well, that is a matter for the postal manager, but I have no objection.  The postman is not a multi-tasker like Deputy Healy-Rae, he is a postman.  This reminds me of a famous former Deputy from County Kerry who had a row with the postman.  It was thought a bit odd in the post office that every day without fail there was a letter for a Kerry constituent who lived three miles up a hill in an isolated farmhouse.  The postman had to cycle up the hill every day to deliver the letter.  It was very odd that the man got a letter with the Dáil stamp on it every day of the week.  When the matter was examined it turned out it was the TD's way of getting his own back on the postman by having him cycle in wind and rain three miles up the hill to deliver a letter every day of the week, and sometimes there was nothing in the envelope.</p>

          <p eId="para_1382">That is true.  To return to the amendment, Deputy Ó Cuív knows as well as I do that fashion changes.  Some of things that were everyday occurrences in rural Ireland 30 years ago have changed dramatically.  He knows that the marketplace here will change as well.  He knows that change is coming down the tracks at the post office everyday and that it is in the interests of the postal service that An Post maintains flexibility in terms of its ability to adapt to those changes in the marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">Deputy Ó Cuív's amendment would make the position of An Post less flexible and it would make the obligations on ComReg less flexible.  It would put An Post into a straitjacket, so to speak, in terms of its capacity to adapt to the changes coming down the tracks.  For that reason I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">Section 16(3) relates to ComReg's power to review the minimum weight limits in regard to the clearance, sorting, transport and distribution of postal packets that a designated universal postal service provider must provide.  The directive sets out the parameters within which this minimum can be set — a range between 10 kg and 20 kg.  The Bill sets the minimum weight at 20 kg, which is the minimum requirement set out in the current postal regulations and allows, rather than requires, ComReg, by order, to reduce that to 10 kg.  In considering any change to the weight limits allowed, ComReg must take into account the reasonable needs of users and also must hold a public consultation in advance of making any change.  There are therefore a number of built-in safeguards relating to any decision that ComReg might make to change the weight limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">Deputy Ó Cuív's proposed amendment would remove a certain flexibility from the regulation of the market which is required to meet the evolving needs of users.  This need for flexibility is particularly pertinent in regard to the parcels market which is fast becoming one of the more dynamic sections of the postal business.  The reasonableness of this section, as drafted, was supported on Committee Stage by Deputy Harrington based on his experience and knowledge of the sector.  I do not propose to amend this section as proposed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1386">Section 16 outlines what a universal postal service means.  Among its provisions is the sorting, transportation and distribution of parcels from other member states up to 20 kg in weight.  I cannot understand how a user of the service could benefit from An Post being able to say at some time in the future, with the approval of ComReg, that a package is over 10 kg in weight and therefore it does not have to carry it.  How that would benefit the user escapes me.  It might benefit An Post but it will not benefit the user.  The regulation provides that any package weighing up to 20 kg from another member state must be sorted, transported and distributed but the Minister wants to allow for a scenario where some fine day, following public consultation and so on, and we know all about public consultations, ComReg will be able to say that if it weighs between 10 kg and 20 kg it does not have to carry it.  The Minister has the gall to stand up and say that benefits the users.</p>

          <p eId="para_1387">I do not know if it is Deputy Ó Cuív's long years in government that has made him so cynical of all exchanges that take place between the elected Oireachtas and institutions established by the Oireachtas.  I have not got that cynical yet.  I believe ComReg takes into account the sensible views of Oireachtas Éireann and sensible views argued with it by other interests.  Why would ComReg approve a change that would be deleterious either to postal users, whom it is required to protect, or to the interests of An Post?  It is unlikely to happen.  The reason we are putting this in the Bill is to ensure that there is flexibility on the part of An Post to react to changes that take place in the market.  I cannot see how the regulator of the service would impose a change that would damage the interests of users and harm the commercial potential of the postal company.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">Throughout the debate Deputy Ó Cuív has posited the regulator as the big, bad bogeyman trying to do down the postal user.  We have no evidence for that since 2000.   A 2002 statute sets out a hierarchy of goals and objectives, in respect of which ComReg must function.  I do not know where this is coming from.  I hope the Deputy's 14 former Cabinet colleagues did not share his cynical view of the world because if that is the case, what is the point in any of us being here?</p>

I have never bought into the god that the European Union and its followers in this country have made out of competition.  Did the Minister ever think ComReg had arrived at an incorrect decision?  Has he ever criticised a decision made by a regulator in this country?  Did he ever think a regulator had failed in its national duty?  I put it to him that on numerous occasions he criticised the banking regulator who was acclaimed as a great independent regulator.  One of the lessons we learned in government was that giving too much independence to regulators made us vulnerable.  We often discussed this issue and, if we made a mistake, it was to make these bodies too independent of the Government, the Oireachtas and the political system.  The notion that the Minister has never criticised the decision of a regulator is laughable.  I wish I had time to count all of the occasions on which he claimed regulators had got it wrong.</p>

It is an abrogation of political responsibility to give powers to regulators without giving the Minister of the day the right of veto.  As we have seen in the recent past, the record of certain regulators has been disgraceful.  While I accept the Minister's assurance that he will protect the postal service while he is in government and I want to believe the Labour Party has as its core a commitment to public service for the benefit of all the people, I do not have the same confidence in his partners in government.  Elements of previous Governments pursued a privatisation agenda, whether for hospitals or whatever else.  The privatisation agenda does not have the national interest at heart.  The national interest and the common good have to be protected by elected representatives.  It is not in the common good to erode or undermine a national service provider such as An Post.  If we depart from the common good, we will allow a system of privatisation which has no interest in anything but making a profit.</p>

Our experience has taught us a tough lesson about profiteering, which is why I dearly value our network of post offices and delivery services.  That is the reason I see danger in this legislation.

Deputy Healy-Rae is correct about the experience of Telecom Éireann, now Eircom, and the asset stripping which resulted in a legacy of under-investment in the network.  However, he is wrong to make a comparison with the provision before us.  The regulator or competition was not at fault in the case of Telecom Éireann.  It was the privatisation of the company that caused the problems.  We are not privatising An Post.  It will remain in State hands.  While Deputy Martin Ferris asked what a Government of a different hue might do, I do not think that position would change.  Fianna Fáil has swung dramatically to the left and is now opposed to privatisation, even though it privatised Telecom Éireann.  The Technical Group which is represented in the Chamber by Deputy Joan Collins might combine into a left-wing group with Fianna Fáil.</p>

ComReg is charged with regulating the market and has the necessary economic and regulatory expertise and knowledge to do so.  If one reads the Bill in its entirety, one would appreciate that there is an onus on ComReg, through its augmented objectives and functions, to ensure the provision of a universal postal service that meets the reasonable needs of users and which must promote the availability of such a service that is affordable for the benefit of all users.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408">Any determination made regarding exemptions would only be made after ComReg had full regard to the reasonable needs of users.  It would not be appropriate to require ministerial approval for any such decision by ComReg, first because of the independence of ComReg in the exercise of its functions and because it would require the Department to duplicate ComReg's work and expertise in the area.</p>

When the parcel service was deregulated, SDS was set up by An Post as its parcel service but it collapsed because competing companies were able to open a warehouse and pay workers low wages with no conditions, contracts or pensions.  Hundreds of good jobs were lost when SDS closed down, and that is what I am talking about.  Everything should be put in place to protect strongly the workers in An Post, which is why the issue should revert to the Minister for consent.</p>

          <p eId="para_1439">Following our discussion on Committee Stage, I undertook to look again at uniform tariffs.  As I mentioned in that debate, the reality is that there has been a uniform domestic tariff in place since the introduction of the penny post in 1840.</p>
          <p eId="para_1440">Having listened to Deputy Ó Cuív — not since 1840 — and explored the issue further, I propose to require that this will be the default in law.  Under section 28, therefore, a uniform tariff will apply throughout the State to any postal service provided at the single piece tariff.  The intention is to ensure An Post's ability to compete with other postal operators is not inappropriately restricted.  Naturally, provision is being retained for the option to move away from this default position if the market develops in a way that necessitates it.  Decisions in this respect would be made by ComReg, having regard to the reasonable needs of users and with the consent of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This is in line with the postal directive that permits the imposition of a uniform tariff in the public interest.  My proposal also provides that if it is decided to undo the requirement for a uniform tariff, ComReg may — again with the consent of the Minister — undo such a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1441">I have also re-examined the issue of a cross-Border uniform tariff, as requested by Deputy Ó Cuív.  I am not proposing to change this option to make it the default in legislation.  As we know, the 55 cent stamp that is charged by An Post for delivering single piece mail covers delivery for the whole island of Ireland.  As pricing issues north of the Border are matters for postal service providers based there and are subject to regulation by a different national regulatory authority, it would be inappropriately restrictive to require An Post to have a cross-Border uniform tariff in primary legislation.  It is more appropriate for the position to remain as it is in the current legislation, which provides that a cross-Border uniform tariff may be required by An Post or ComReg with the consent of the Minister.  As I understand it, An Post has no intention of changing the position that has obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442">Arising from these proposals, I have decided to amend section 28(2).  A small number of consequential amendments are required to update cross-references.  I trust that Deputy Ó Cuív will support these amendments, which arise from our discussion on Committee Stage.  I cannot accept amendment No. 23, which proposes to add the words "which are less" to section 28(3).  The section in question provides that the application of a uniform tariff does not prevent a designated universal service provider from negotiating and concluding individual agreements with users on prices.  The proposed amendment is not necessary and may unduly constrain An Post in negotiating with other postal service providers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1443">I welcome this as far as it goes.  I thank the Minister for having gone part of the way that I wanted him to go.  I believe in the fundamental geographical and — I hope in the future — political and social unity of this island.  Therefore, I would like it to be enshrined in primary law that the uniform tariff should apply to a letter posted from anywhere within the State to anywhere on this island.  I am glad the Minister has come some of the way.  I particularly note that despite all the Minister's protestations earlier that he cannot be directing here and there, amendment No. 20 provides for the phrase "with the prior consent of the Minister" to be included in sections 28(2)(<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>).  He has proved my point that it is easy to write lots of ministerial consents into the legislation.  The idea that to do so would interfere with the independence of ComReg in some way is totally undermined by all these provisions requiring the consent of the Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_729" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_1444">There is absolutely no inconsistency between emphasising the statutorily based independence of the regulator and making express provision for the consent of the Minister to be required in certain circumstances or providing for the capacity of the Minister to issue policy directives.  Deputy Ó Cuív used a good example earlier when he spoke about the banking regulator.  He was quite right to say I criticised the banking regulator.  I was right to do so.  It is a great pity that his colleagues did not criticise the banking regulator.  If they had done so, we would not be in the mess we are in.  If I had a choice — I am speaking on the eve of the most momentous meeting in Europe since we joined the EEC in 1973 — I would prefer if the cock-ups that were made in the banking service had been made by the postal service regulator.  We could have survived that.  It remains to be seen whether we will be able to survive the legacy of Deputy Ó Cuív and his colleagues, who were asleep at the wheel when the banking regulator was failing to do his job.  There was negligence of duty on the part of the various mechanisms that were built into the system, in terms of the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance.  That left us in the situation we are in this evening, on the eve of a meeting in Europe of a magnitude of importance that this country has never experienced in its time as a member state of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445">There is no conflict here.  The areas where the consent of the Minister must be sought have been carefully calibrated.  The underlying theme in Deputy Ó Cuív's argument is that he is feigning not to accept the role of regulation.  Let me take that back.  I will take him at face value.  He does not accept the role of regulation in the utilities that have been the subject of regulation in recent years.  Ironically, the paternity of those arrangements lies with successive Governments of which he was a part.  The regulation of energy, telecommunications, electronics, the postal service and so on has come with particular directives, one of which we are transposing into Irish law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_730">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_1446">When I was in government, I was always very wary of transposing power away from Ministers.  I have always believed the Minister will get the blame, even if independent regulation has been provided for.  There seems to be some amnesia within the Labour Party about its love affair with independent regulation.  The Deputies opposite have forgotten that the demand for an independent banking regulator, separate from the Central Bank, arose from the Opposition benches.  When it turned out that the system was not great, they emphasised the fact that it had been introduced by the Government.  At the time, however, there had been great demand among Opposition Deputies for its introduction.  They wanted everything to be independent.  As Minister, I consistently made a different argument.  In the Departments for which I was responsible, I was careful to act in a way that did not allow things to move too far away.  I did that for the obvious reason that I was concerned about the problems we subsequently experienced.  I was worried that regulators who were not answerable to Ministers could make their own decisions.  I was aware, as the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has said, that Ministers would be held responsible for the actions of regulators at the end of the day even though they had not part in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1447">I am openly sceptical about European regulations.  The fetish that the regulated market would sort everything led to the banking crisis.  The EU imposed strict controls on how much governments could borrow and what they could do, but it did not impose any controls on the private banking sector across Europe.  Even if we had regulated the banks here, that would not have stopped the foreign banks from coming here, as they did, and engaging in crazy lending.  I believe we should maintain maximum control here.  The Minister has agreed with the principle here.  All we are arguing about this evening, in large measure, is where the line between ministerial oversight and regulatory discretion should be drawn.  We are arguing that the Minister has not gone far enough in ensuring ministerial oversight.  We believe anything that is in the national interest should be the subject of ministerial oversight rather than being at the discretion of ComReg.</p>

          <p eId="para_1463">To remind Deputies, terminal dues is the mechanism used by national postal operators to settle with each other for the delivery of international service mail.  In terms of international mail, given the reciprocal nature of terminal dues agreements, the handling of mail between national postal operators is inherently different to handling mail from non-designated or private postal service providers and consolidators who manage companies' large mail requirements.  The directive acknowledges this difference by distinguishing between the regulation of tariffs for universal services generally and the regulation of terminal dues.  I therefore concluded that the link between special tariffs and terminal dues was not appropriate and that section 28(5) should be deleted.  I hope this meets the arguments advanced by Deputy Deering on the last occasion and Deputy Olivia Mitchell and others.</p>

Tá súil agam go nglacfaidh an tAire leis an leasú seo.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the position of the Irish language as the first official language of the State will be taken into account in deciding the postcodes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480">We saw the difficulty that arose many years ago with the registration of cars.  We should lay down a clear direction from the Oireachtas to those who are developing this that the constitutional position of the language cannot be ignored in devising a postcode system.  It is a simple, basic and fundamental concept.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481">There are those who argue that this poses great difficulties but in society nobody has a problem with Bord na Móna, CIE, FÁS and many other terms such as Oireachtas, Cathaoirleach, Ceann Comhairle.  There was a good positive tradition in the State, which, unfortunately, in more recent years has waned, to ensure that in public nomenclature the Irish language was given its proper place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1482">It is important in this legislation that we ensure the position of the Irish language is protected.  If the Minister checks the record of the observations made on this Bill, no doubt he will find observations made by the Department which I headed up when I was in Government on this issue seeking that this matter would be addressed.  It was agreed by the previous Government that no decision was to be taken on this issue without the explicit permission of Government and the previous Government was quite clear that the Irish language had to be taken into account in any postcode system that would have been brought forward by the previous Minister.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will accept this amendment in the spirit in which it is put down and that we come up with a system that is uniformly acceptable to people across the State.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_1483">The amendment submitted by the Deputy would require the Minister to have regard to the position of the Irish language as the national language in the operation of any national postcode system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1484">While I am sympathetic to the aims of the proposal I do not propose to accept it on a number of grounds.  The first is that a procurement process is currently under way for a national postcode system.  That procurement is designed to produce a technical specification and an implementation plan for a national postcode system.  The issue of what that specification will be and how it will take effect in an operating postcode will be determined through that competition.  The issue of memorability or placename recognition by the general public will be an important consideration in any final recommendation to Government.  The Government will take a view on the proposals emerging from the procurement process before committing to a postcode roll-out process.  The language issue will be dealt with as part of the procurement but it is neither necessary nor appropriate to set language related conditions on the process at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1485">My Department has published a notice seeking candidates to implement a national postcode system.  That notice states that the conclusions and recommendations of the National Postcodes Project Board should be the basis of the implementation but that innovation with regard to the incorporation of the unique identification of properties should be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1486">Although the procurement is being managed by my Department on a ring-fenced basis, any final go-ahead will require Government approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_1487">In making a final decision on the project the Government will consider a variety of issues, including financial, operational and technical issues.  The position of the national language will form part of this consideration.</p>

            <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_1637">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this new legislation which will provide legal protection for low-paid workers.  This should be supported by all parties in the House as it protects the workers in the regulated sectors who are affected by the High Court judgment.  The Government should face up to reality and assist hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers.  Once again, the Labour Party has walked off the pitch.  It should stop hiding behind Fine Gael on this priority issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">The recent statements by the Minister for Social Protection were a disgrace, misinformed, dangerous in the current climate and, above all, insulting to the tens of thousands of people who are unemployed.  This is not acceptable from the Minister and she should withdraw her remarks or resign.  I was shocked and dismayed that a Labour Party Minister would say that.  The more worrying aspect for the poorer section of society is what the Minister has planned next in her so-called reforms, which is the new code for cuts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">The late Deputy and former Minister, Mr. Frank Cluskey, in 1977 set up the community welfare service, which was to provide a safety net for the poorer and weaker sections of society and to help people on the margins.  The current Minister plans to scrap these 1,000 front-line staff, with their transformation team, and — wait for it — turn them into social activation officers, which in fact means snoops.  These welfare police will now become hit men and hit women against the poor and the Minister will have dismantled the last line of defence.  Did anyone ever think they would see a day when a Labour Party Minister would slash and burn welfare services?</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">The Government cannot hide behind the troika of the IMF-EU-ECB.  These are choices and many of us in the Independent group have put forward options on these choices in recent months.  We have dealt openly with the debate on tax versus cuts and all proposals have been costed.  We are not just against issues; we are also putting forward sensible solutions.  However, hammering low-paid workers, the unemployed and the disabled should never be an option in any democratic republic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">This Bill seeks to help 250,000 workers over the summer period and will prevent exploitation.  Kicking the now famous can down the road is not an option and definitely not a solution.  I urge Members to support this legislation.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_749">
            <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_1642">Prior to the High Court decision, I attended a large meeting in my constituency of people, mostly women, who were employed under the joint labour committee, JLC rules.  All were low paid and all were concerned about maintaining their living standards.  Some spoke of there being little incentive to work were they to take further pay cuts or were their incomes to be reduced further or eroded through levies or charges.  Some were at pains to point out their employment was of a casual nature and their employer kept cutting their hours to the point where it was no longer worthwhile to work.  Moreover, they told me that others were being employed at the minimum wage to replace them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">Since the High Court decision, Members have been informed that those who were employed under JLCs would be protected by their contract of employment.  The experience I have just recounted outlines how vulnerable some of these workers are and demonstrates how in many cases their contracts are not worth the paper on which they are written.  These workers were employed in the retail sector and spoke of how they used to enjoy their jobs but that it now has become a battle between themselves and their employer.  Many were sick with worry about how they would pay their bills and mortgages or how they would feed their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1644">While I support this Bill in principle, I acknowledge it is flawed.  I note the Government has promised a more comprehensive Bill in the autumn and there is an absolute need to give guarantees to the approximately 200,000 people who are meant to be protected under the former JLCs.  Moreover, it is essential that information be given to these people in the shortest possible time.  When the Technical group devoted its Private Members' time to this issue, it was possible to discern a clear difference between Fine Gael and Labour Party Members as one party articulated the employers' side while the other articulated that of the employees.  It is essential to outline what exactly will be the approach to give some comfort to these people who are concerned about their living standards.  At present, it is as though it is the last secret of Fatima.  The Government should outline exactly what is ahead for these people even if there will be a delay in bringing forward legislation.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_750">
            <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
            <p eId="para_1645">On this issue, a little unlike Deputy Finian McGrath, I stand firmly behind the Labour Party.  This is an extremely difficult problem and it would not be a good idea to have a knee-jerk reaction to a highly controversial court case of this nature.  It appears as though this pertains to the discretion that is exercised by the joint labour committees and it probably will take some time to sort out this matter.  In the present climate, there is a danger of creating an industrial relations atmosphere that is conducive to old-fashioned hostilities.  In particular at present, on foot of the death of social partnership, a new plan and model for industrial relations probably is needed.  This certainly will not be built on the old social partnership model, which now is dead and which bears much responsibility for the artificial boom because of excessive payments.  However, it also demands a great deal of thought as to how to match the legitimate grievances of people for whom this Bill caters with the needs of small businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">At the time, many Deputies and Senators were lobbied extensively about the proposed increase to the minimum wage.  I could not help but be split on that issue because on the one hand, as Deputy Catherine Murphy has so eloquently noted, the plight of people who are in receipt of the minimum wage is something that cannot be allowed as a civilised society.  On the other hand, I also was impressed by small employers in the retail sector who came forward and stated with legitimacy and honesty that they could not afford to pay the premium rates that were being demanded for Sundays and so on.</p>

          <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_753">
            <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
            <p eId="para_1649">It appears as though Fianna Fáil does not seek to have this Bill passed through all Stages before the Dáil rises for the recess but rather through Committee Stage only.  In that sense, anything that might come out of it would not take effect until the autumn in any case and could not offer additional protection to workers formerly covered by the JLCs and employment regulation orders, EROs.  If this is the case, the Bill amounts to nothing more than a stunt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">Fine Gael's response has been to state that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will instead introduce an interim protection in the autumn.  The idea that the person whose stated objective is to neutralise the entire system of registered employment agreements, REAs, and EROs will somehow transform himself into its saviour is laughable.</p>

            <p eId="para_1652">The High Court decision that the JLCs were unconstitutional represents an extremely serious attack on workers who already were highly vulnerable.  Statistics were provided during the last debate on this topic that showed the enormous number of breaches that take place in these sectors in any case.  In effect, employers now have been given the green light to decimate wages and conditions and this intention is spelled out clearly by organisations such as IBEC, which is lauding the fact that pay rates for new workers have fallen by as much as 20% to 30% in recent years.  It is quite clear that over the summer, workers will face the issuing of new contracts.  My point is that if Fianna Fáil is serious in this regard and is serious about introducing protection, the legislation must be pushed through all Stages before the Dáil rises for the summer.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_756">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_1653">A lot of politics is being played with this issue.  The Government has of course questioned Fianna Fáil's credentials, and rightly so given that the latter reduced the minimum wage and signed up to the IMF-EU deal which demanded this so-called labour market restructuring.  The Government also has described this Bill as being inadequate, which it is, but that is all politics.  The Government has chosen not to oppose this Bill because it, and its Labour Party component in particular, is on a hook over this issue.  This is because the base of the Labour Party's support in the trade union movement would explode with anger were it to oversee the dismantling or weakening of the JLCs.  Were the Labour Party Members serious when stating they do not intend to oppose this Bill, they would be screaming from the rooftops both to see this Bill proceed beyond Second Stage and to demand the reconvening of the Dáil next week to push through this legislation, imperfect as it is, as a stopgap to protect the workers covered by the JLCs and REAs.  Of course, none of them intend to do this because it is all about simply pushing the issue down the road before the real decisions are made in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">I believe I speak on behalf of low-paid workers who are affected by the JLCs and REAs and who are deeply fearful because their already miserable pay and conditions are under attack when I tell the Government that if it is serious about caring for such workers, it should give Members absolutely cast iron assurances that as a result of the review it is bringing forward, not a single cent will be lost from the incomes of low-paid workers.  Moreover, it should provide assurances that none of the protections enjoyed by low-paid workers now covered by the JLCs or REAs will be taken away from them.  This is the assurance they seek and I note the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has not given to them.  This gives me reason to believe, as both Fine Gael and Labour Party Members are aware, that under the diktats of the EU-IMF, the Government intends to attack these low-paid workers, that is, those who already are the working poor.</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
            <p eId="para_1659">I have a couple of comments to make.  First, the Government is not opposing this Bill because it recognises its intention is genuine.  However, it does not believe it goes far enough and does not consider it to be sufficiently legally sound to achieve the job.  Nevertheless, it recognises that this Bill constitutes a genuine attempt.  There is nothing wrong with it on its own but it simply is not good enough.  Rushing it through tonight or allowing it to proceed would only introduce more confusion and grey areas because it will not achieve the desired changes in this area.  It will not deal with the judgment.  It is piecemeal legislation and it will not provide clarity and direction.  It is all right to move slowly in the right direction but moving fast in the wrong direction means one is no further on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has committed to introducing legislation as soon as possible, and I understand this will be in the first week of the new Dáil session, which is only five or six weeks time.  We are not taking a 12-week holiday as was the case in the past.  For the sake of a few weeks let us get it right.  I imagine Deputy O'Dea would like to get it right because it has been wrong for a long time.  Others had the chance to fix it.  They talked about it and even produced Bills and left them sitting there.  This Government will do it because it said it would.  This Government wants to see jobs being created and to protect jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">Deputy Ross referred to the debate about the minimum wage.  The former Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard calls from various groups who wanted to reduce the minimum wage.  We always asked them to prove to the committee that leaving the minimum wage alone was an impediment to job creation, but they could not prove it.  We did the right thing by returning the rate to what it had been because it was wrong to lower it.  It was not the IMF or the EU but rather a Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government that did that.  It suggested it to the Commissioner and not the other way around.  We put that right because we believe in protecting low-paid workers and we believe in protecting jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">The issue regarding the JLC agreements and other agreements is very complicated.  The structures, rules and regulations, the red tape and the procedures are a deterrent and they are costing business, as are some of the rates.  Deputy Ross gave the example of a local shop on a Sunday or a bank holiday Monday.  In some cases such shops genuinely cannot afford to employ a person at twice the rate of pay or more in some cases.  Something has to be done because this situation is costing jobs.  Our duty is to create jobs and to protect jobs.  I know that the owners of shops are working on Sundays or a bank holiday Monday rather than giving a job to a student or someone with no other source of income bar that one day a week.  They are missing out on the opportunity for work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1663">I know that Christmas, Sunday and bank holiday work is unsocial work because I did that work for years when I was young.  We have to recognise that fact but it is also a chance for a person to start a job and learn about the world of work.  We owe a debt of gratitude to many of these businesses because they have given young people a start in a job.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">It is right to reform this area to make it easier for jobs to be created.  The evidence is that jobs have been lost and that is why it must be addressed, not because of a mean Government.  The minimum wage was mean but we are planning a proper reform.  The rates of pay will be dealt with by the joint labour committees.  The Minister will not be lecturing us on the exact rates of pay because this will be done as part of the process.  The reform has to be done.  This Bill does not go far enough and it does not deal with all the implications of the judgment.  We will not have the full details of the judgment until 25 July.  It would be most unwise to push through legislation without having a proper, informed debate which would begin with a detailed judgment to hand.</p>

          <speech by="#ColmKeaveney" eId="spk_762">
            <from>Deputy Colm Keaveney</from>
            <p eId="para_1665">There are two ways we can view the recent High Court ruling on the issue of JLCs and EROs.  We can look at the situation as it currently pertains as a complete disaster or we can look at it as a new opportunity.  In my view, we really do not have the time to waste looking at this as a disaster.  It should be seen as an opportunity.  I appreciate that Deputy Boyd Barrett is very concerned about the situation, as are we all.  I remind him it was not the Dáil which dismantled the JLCs but rather the High Court.  I hope there is broad agreement in the House that this is a matter to be addressed as comprehensively and speedily as possible once we return in September.  Admittedly, however, there is no straightforward, quick-fix solution, as Deputy Finian McGrath would like to believe.  The complexity of the issues surrounding the High Court ruling on the joint labour committee agreements cannot be understated.  It is no exaggeration to say that we have a mountain to climb over the course of the summer recess to put the correct legislation before the House at the earliest opportunity.  However, we should not use any excuse to delay action because it would be regarded as a fault of this House if there were to be an attack on the working poor before the publication of the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">I am surprised that someone with the legal wisdom of Deputy Willie O'Dea, whom I have always considered to be a person of great legal mind and a good political operator, has failed to foresee the sequence of events which led to this situation.  Fianna Fáil had the time and the opportunity to enact the required change but it passed up on that opportunity.  It cannibalised its own Bill in the process and, in effect, its members have done a cut and paste job to take advantage of vulnerable working people.  I am not going to argue with Deputy O'Dea on that point because we need to focus on how we can help the situation.  The Members of this House were not elected to talk about Fianna Fáil but rather to protect those in society who are unable to protect themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">The High Court ruling does not provide an opportunity for reform.  We have to set out a goal to limit any unfair treatment by opportunistic employers and we need to decide how quickly we can put strong legislation in place.  We are faced with an opportunity to overhaul comprehensively an archaic and broken system.  The High Court has decided it is broken.  With the correct approach we can set down new, modernised wage setting mechanisms in a constitutional manner.  This is an opportunity to restore full decency and fairness to the system, for workers and employers alike, and to introduce mechanisms which realistically reflect the challenges of a modern economy and society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">We have had the dialogue and the debate.  We are all in broad agreement on the necessity of reforms.  Despite the difficulties we face and the legal complexity surrounding the issues, this is not an insurmountable challenge.  The crucial point is we must move quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">Any new system developed over the course of the summer must ensure unreservedly that workers in JLC sectors end up earning no less than their current wages.  A new system should allow for equal if not greater levels of pay for workers who are the real backbone of this economy.  When this issue is discussed in September, I do not want to hear the term "pay flexibility" thrown around as corporate and political language in an attempt to attack the working poor.  This group has been hit the hardest as a consequence of the downturn in the economy.  These are the lowest paid workers in society who are least deserving of a pay cut as a consequence of the failure of the previous Administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">I wish to highlight a recent League of Credit Unions survey which found that more than 585,000 people surveyed see no future for themselves or their families in this country.  This is a shameful number.  It is up to this Government to put a stop to this thinking.  We will not do so by undermining the ability of ordinary workers to live stable and financially secure lives without the worry that their jobs will be taken from them or that they will be subject to cuts in their wage rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">The Minister and his Department have a mountain to climb but there is nothing that cannot be achieved.  I am confident a political solution will be found and that workable, robust and constitutionally viable reforms will be put in place when the Government returns to business in September.</p>

          <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_763">
            <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
            <p eId="para_1672">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  Deputy Ross is correct that this is a complicated issue.  There is a balance to be struck in trying to ensure those who are protected under what was the JLC system continue to be protected to ensure it is more attractive to seek a job than not to, which would be the risk if the JLC system were to be turned upside down.  We would be in a much worse position on foot of this judgment had the Duffy-Walsh review not been initiated.  Otherwise we might have been looking for a suspension of Standing Orders to allow the House to discuss the situation because we had nothing prepared.  As it is, quite an advanced amount of preparation work has been done and we are awaiting the final report and conclusions from the consultation process that took place on foot of the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">We all agree on certain things.  The areas to which the main EROs and REAs apply have suffered the greatest job losses since 2008.  There has been a 60% loss of employment in construction, and 15% in the retail and wholesale sectors.  Catering and hotels have seen a 20% loss.  Something is broken and needs fixing.  Any employer will say — I am sure no employee will disagree — that there is too much bureaucracy in employment law.  While employment legislation was introduced, the law it replaced still seems to remain on the Statute Book.  The JLCs were introduced before we had a minimum wage and legislation to protect the rights of workers in the workplace and to ensure they and the employers were given equal opportunity to ensure fair play existed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">There are people on the minimum wage to whom this JLC structure does not apply.  For 4% of the working population, employers have been able to avail of a 50% PRSI reduction.  It does not apply to people on JLCs.  As a young and not so young fellow, I worked behind a bar on a Sunday, which was the only day of the week I could work.  Under the current regime I would not be able to work and there are many people in that category.  Deputy English spoke about the people for whom weekend work is critical to allowing them to go to college or whatever, and we need to be cognisant of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">We need to strike a balance and it will be difficult.  It is accepted that people come from different perspectives on this issue.  People in this Chamber can be pigeonholed politically.  If we get too political on this, we will not resolve it.  We will have a halfway to nothing solution that will still be archaic and unfit for purpose.  Let us realise that and try to work it together.  It is not often I call for all-party agreement, but on this one we need to have it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#GeraldNash" eId="spk_764">
            <from>Deputy Gerald Nash</from>
            <p eId="para_1676">As a contribution to the challenge we face over the need to protect and secure the wages and conditions of those employed in areas governed by the JLC and ERO system, I welcome the publication of this Bill and the opportunity to speak on its provisions.  Elements of the Bill attract my support and that of the Labour Party and Government in general.  The basic principals are philosophically sound and it represents a reasonable effort to address some of the fall-out from the Feeney judgment two weeks ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">However, even to the untrained eye, the frailties inherent in the legislation are all too apparent.  In whatever way we slice and dice it, the Bill is essentially a reheated version of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009.  However, that was then and this is now, and in light of the Feeney judgment, we have entered an entirely new dimension.  The JLC and ERO system which has served our economy and society well since its inception has been struck down as unconstitutional.  Despite what some members of the Opposition would have us believe, the direct implications of the judgment are such that no quick-fix solution exists that can be taken off the shelf, dusted down and represented as something it is not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">We need fresh thinking to deal with a fundamentally altered scenario while achieving the same outcomes enjoyed by those employed under the JLC and ERO system.  It would be disingenuous and dangerously misleading for anyone in this House to suggest that this, or indeed any other legislative proposition that has been put forward, whether in this House or outside in recent days, is sufficiently robust to achieve the outcome on which there is a degree of unanimity around the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">I accept the Bill represents a genuine effort to have one substantial element of the Feeney judgment settled, which is the issue to do with the glaring absence of strong guiding policies and principles from this law-making body in terms of wage setting mechanisms.  This is all well and good up to a point.  However, any reasonable analysis of this effort presented to us by Fianna Fáil is completely silent on the entire issue of property rights.  Not just in this instance, but in a whole raft of trade union and employment rights legislation, this constitutional issue of property rights has reared its unwelcome head.  It is grotesque and, frankly, disturbing to me that in the context of this and other matters, the issue of the protection of individual property rights appears to have primacy in our Constitution over the rights of the individual citizen to a decent living wage and, moreover, the right to have those circumstances protected.  This is a matter that should be pursued and examined shortly by the constitutional convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">Last night Deputies O'Dea and Niall Collins, from the party that brought us such hits as the slashing of the national minimum wage and the blanket bank guarantee, were straining at the leash to have a go at the Labour Party, asking us what we stand for.  It could be argued that the crocodile tears they shed on this serious matter are an insult to honest crocodiles everywhere.  As Deputy White said yesterday evening, we stand for legislation that will work and not for legislation that is clearly frail and frankly a bit on the anaemic side.  We will not do a Grand Old Duke of York on it and pretend that if this so-called emergency legislation is passed, everything will be fine in the morning, which it will not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">Notwithstanding all of that, the Bill requires additional examination and has a degree of merit, and I support what the Minister is doing now and what we will be doing over the summer period to address comprehensively the issues facing us and the 200,000 workers who need our protection and need a new structure to protect and vindicate their interests and rights robustly and vigorously.</p>

          <speech by="#AineCollins" eId="spk_765">
            <from>Deputy Áine Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_1682">We all agree this is a very important issue on which a balance needs to be found.  It is vital that the Government reforms the present system in order that businesses that are struggling will be able to hold on to existing jobs, create new jobs and encourage others to set up business.  The downturn in the economy has had a profound effect on the labour market, with areas such as retail, accommodation, food and construction being among those hardest hit.  For example, there has been a 60% loss of employment in construction and a 15% to 20% loss in the wholesale and retail sectors.  Hotels and catering have seen a 20% loss in employment alone in the past three years.  While demand in these sectors is clearly a key factor, labour costs represent a high proportion of total costs.  Some 39% of restaurants no longer open on Sundays owing to labour costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">In the present environment it is vital to ensure that these structures are flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances and that they reflect the realities of our present day economy.  The recently published live register figures make it clear that the time for business as usual in any sector of the economy is long past.  The challenge facing the Government is indeed enormous.  We were elected to change current practices and it is clear from the Duffy-Walsh report that reform is needed.  The policies pursued over the past 14 years by our predecessors in government have got us into the mess we are now experiencing.  The previous Government had ample time to pass such a Bill through the Oireachtas, but as usual it procrastinated.  It will take several years of good government and good policies to put things back on track.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">The Bill is largely cut and pasted from the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 which was introduced by the previous Government in August 2009 in response to the commencement of the Quick Service Food Alliance case in December 2008.  However, despite being welcomed by all sides, the Bill was never progressed by that Government beyond Second Stage in the Dáil and it lapsed with the end of the previous Dáil in early 2011.  With 446,800 people on the live register at present, we must realise that action is needed urgently which is why the Government will address the issue early in September.  We need to provide people with the opportunity to get back to work, and job creation must be on the top of all our agendas.  To that end, I welcome this debate.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_766">
            <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan</from>
            <p eId="para_1685">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I feel a sense of <i>déjà vu</i>.  I agree with Deputy Keaveney’s comments that the Bill is rather similar to one introduced in 2009.  I was Fine Gael’s enterprise spokesman in the Seanad when it discussed Second Stage of similar legislation, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, which was agreed by all parties in both Houses.  For Fianna Fáil to propose what is more or less the same Bill is a bit rich, as is its claim that it supports poorly paid workers.  For 14 years, Fianna Fáil had the opportunity to support them and could have introduced legislation in the past year and a half, but it did not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">Given our support for the Bill a year and a half ago, we will not vote it down tonight, but the legislation's thrust does not address most of the key issues raised by the Feeney judgment in the High Court a couple of weeks ago.  Deputy Doyle was correct to state that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, had done a great deal of work on this area in recent months.  Thankfully, when the Houses return in September, the Minister will be in a position to introduce a more detailed and comprehensive Bill to address a complex set of questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">Approximately 450,000 people in our society are out of work.  It must be the clear priority of everyone in both Houses to ensure we do everything we can during the lifetime of this Oireachtas to return as many of those people to work as possible.  I support the Minister's efforts to reform the JLC structure.  While debating the previous Bill in the Seanad a year and a half ago, I highlighted to the then Minister, Mr. Batt O'Keeffe, the inadequacies of the JLC system whereby different payments are made in different parts of the country based purely on a job's geographical location and not on the role being performed.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is correct to try to reform that structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">I do not agree with some Deputies who said people are playing politics with this issue.  The Government has already shown itself to be committed to protecting the poorest workers by increasing the minimum wage to the level from which our predecessors reduced it.  We are committed to ensuring the lowest paid workers are looked after, but our overarching commitment must be to the 450,000 people who do not have jobs but want them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">Before attending this debate, I spoke with a friend who has been offered a job in London and is about to leave.  I have countless friends living in that city and other parts of the world because of the policies pursued for 14 years by Deputy O'Dea's party in government.  It is disingenuous to introduce this legislation and claim that Fianna Fáil is looking after the poorest workers in the land when it is responsible for so many of them needing to leave the country in the first place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tom Barry</from>
            <p eId="para_1690">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill.  The JLCs need to be put on a strong constitutional footing.  Until this is done, uncertainty will reign, which will be of no benefit to anyone concerned.  We have witnessed the death of social partnership, although I have my doubts about whether it was ever a real social partnership.  It based its foundations on the notion that money could solve all problems.  This was true for a time, but we no longer have money and must now face the challenge of making the system work.  We must look forward and there is no point in looking back, as it will not put bread on the tables of those who constantly worry about how they will keep their homes etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">I grow disappointed with Deputies jumping up and down and getting excited about protecting workers while not realising that we are all here to stand up for workers.  As an employer, it disappoints me to see some Deputies who do not know how to create a job speaking on the subject and accusing everyone else of having no conscience on the matter.  I have trained employees who then left because of €1 or less per hour at high rates, but the circumstances have reversed.  Long-term employees bring stability and continuity to a business.  If a business has long-term employees, it is operating well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">The question of employers needs to be addressed, as it is not in many employers' interests to decimate workers' wages.  We all must come through this financial crisis, which we will do by co-operating.  Some people will try to abuse the system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1694">Regarding atypical hours, countries like Spain virtually shut down on Sunday whereas we have become used to our country working throughout Sunday.  People should only work all day on Sunday if something critical needs to get done that day.  One cannot demand money from a business if doing so will cause that business to fail in the long term.  As many Deputies will realise, the countryside has seen the systematic destruction of its shops and villages.  It has no more shops.  We need to determine what we can do about thisissue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">Optimising job creation is a skill and must be the priority.  We must use our heads in reforming the JLCs, which will play a fundamental role in where we go from this point.  We cannot buy job creation with money.  The farming industry is a good example of a cyclical system — some years one is down, some years one is up.  We need to examine JLCs in the long term and determine how to work through the economic crisis together.</p>

            <p eId="para_1698">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important legislation and I compliment my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, on drafting it.  The briefings prepared by the Labour and Fine Gael research offices on the Bill's contents and its alleged similarity with the 2009 Bill are incorrect.  Only one section of this Bill is similar to part of the 2009 legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">Deputy Nash stated that, during the summer, Government Deputies will work on this issue collectively.  There has not been much evidence to date of collective thinking, given the rush by numerous Labour Party Deputies to criticise the Minister, Deputy Bruton, via their press office.  If they were so concerned about the inadequacy of this legislation, I am surprised by their support for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">Following the 7 July High Court decision, the Minister gave a solemn commitment publicly and in his meetings with senior trade unionists that legislation would be introduced immediately to deal with this emergency issue, but it is another post-election Government commitment that will not be honoured.  Deputy John Paul Phelan claimed the Minister had been working hard on this issue, but there is no evidence of such.  No preparatory work on the High Court case's anticipated outcome seems to have been done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">Every Member has received e-mails, correspondence and telephone calls from all individuals across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">Thousands of low paid workers are concerned and fearful about this decision.  This Bill was drafted to protect those workers.  Government inaction on the issue is leaving low paid workers in a precarious position, as outlined to us in correspondence from many individuals; the trade unions went as far as describing the situation as devastating for workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">The JLC system was established in 1946 when the late Seán Lemass was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In a total revamping of industrial relations legislation of the time, he established the committees.  Not alone were they established to set wages, they were established to deal with conditions, another important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1704">The JLCs have been an important part of the industrial relations architecture since that period.  With some revamping they set minimum rates of pay, terms and conditions for classes of workers operating in more than one trade.  The individual JLCs are composed of employer and worker representatives, generally from representative organisations and trade unions, and an independent chairman.  The JLCs propose minimum pay and conditions that are then drafted into employment regulation orders by the Labour Court, commonly referred to as EROs.  Enforcement is not through the State industrial relations machinery but through the labour inspectorate in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The areas covered by the committees include hospitality, the food and retail sectors, clothing and contract cleaning.  They were hugely important in many areas of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">This emergency legislation is needed because the High Court ruled that the JLC system of setting wages was unconstitutional.  As a result, workers whose remuneration was governed by employment regulation orders on or before 7 July no longer have the statutory benefits of those employment regulation orders.  This Bill provides for the amendment of the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 and 1990 so the statutory mechanism in place for the fixing of remuneration by an employment regulation order is consistent with the requirements of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  The Bill also decriminalises any failure on the part of an employer to comply with an ERO as recommended in the Duffy-Walsh report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">If this Bill is enacted it will allow the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation to make new employment regulation orders in respect of all such workers under a new statutory mechanism that takes into account and rectifies the failings in the 1946 and 1990 Acts.  It is important the case was taken by companies in the catering sector when it can apply to so many workers in different sectors.  This is important to a huge number of workers, generally in the lower paid sectors of the economy, and I am glad to support this legislation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
            <p eId="para_1707">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2011.  I compliment Deputy O'Dea for being so quick to introduce this legislation.  One section is based on previous legislation but much of it is new and was put together in light of the recent High Court judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">I commend him for moving so quickly on the issue to protect people's rights.  It is not only a question protecting the pay rates of employees but also the businesses of the employers.  It is important people recognise this is not an employee versus employer situation.  Everyone must be balanced in our discussions.  There are benefits in this legislation for employees and, equally, there are benefits for employers in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">Without this legislation there is a gap in the system and those good employers who want to pay people the rates that had already been agreed and who want to tender for a contract on the basis of those rates could find unscrupulous employers submitting a tender based on lower wages that are not covered in previous agreements.  Good employers with long-term employees could find themselves losing business because they are being undercut by those who will take advantage of the lack of legislation or an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">The situation was so serious following the High Court decision that the Government should have lodged an appeal.  That would have bought time to draft legislation and, in the meantime, the existing regime would have remained in place.  By the time we return in autumn, the legislation could have been finalised to deal with these issues and could have overtaken the appeal.  I see no reason why the Government will not lodge an appeal on this issue in the morning to show it is committed to protecting the agreements.  That does not prevent it from coming forward with new legislation to improve the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">People have claimed the legislation is not perfect; they agree with the principles but they have found areas where the phraseology is not sufficient.  That is the purpose of this House.  The legislation can be published then teased out on Committee Stage, with amendments made, so that by the time it completes its passage through the Oireachtas, it will be better.  If Deputies on the Government side refuse to support legislation on Second Stage because there are some imperfections in it, no Bill will ever be passed because I have never seen legislation passed being the same as legislation initiated.  That is the essence of a democratic parliament, that it would make changes to legislation.  Anyone who had an issue with the Bill would have been able to deal with it on Committee Stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">People understand the gist of what we are talking about but I got an education in employment regulation orders, registered employment agreements and joint labour committees when issues arose in the catering trade when lots of hotel and restaurant owners in the midlands came to me to complain about NERA inspections.  If a wedding took place on a Saturday and it spilled over until 12.15 a.m. on the Sunday morning, NERA said those staff must be paid the Sunday rate because they had been there for half an hour after midnight.  In some cases the employees had left the business three years previously and the employers were told to find those people wherever they were in the world and to send them cheques.  Employers were made to feel like criminals because they had not paid people their proper wages but those were the wages that were agreed and understood.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">I accept some of the legislation was drafted by the last Government but the current Government and its legal advisors should have been ready for this decision.  The Duffy-Walsh report had been published and the review was underway.  The Government should have drafted legislation on that basis and should have been ready to move the next day if it did not want to go to the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">It decided to do neither, not to appeal to the Supreme Court and not to introduce amending legislation in the meantime that would meet the constitutional requirements highlighted in the High Court.  That is why so many workers are in this difficult situation.  This was struck down for constitutional reasons but I do not hesitate to say that the legislation, had it been tested with the full rigour of the law, would not have stood up in any court of law and the Department must have known that for a time and should have been ready to bring forward legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">Owners of hotels and restaurants, in particular, came to me in the last couple of years and when I pointed out their sector representative had approved of the wage agreement at a JLC, some of them who were new in the business did not know there was a JLC covering it and did not know there was a representative for them on a JLC.  If this had been tested, the practicality of implementing these agreements would have been utterly, 100% defective.  They were not representative bodies because the majority of people allegedly represented by the employers' representatives were not represented by them.  Representation should mean that people are being represented and not that representatives are there in name only.  It would have been struck down on that point.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">The Government has choices to make and has made a choice concerning these particular workers.  The Government came in with a pension levy, which is fine.  It was its decision, as it was to reduce VAT, which is fine also.  It also increased the minimum wage, but it has decided not to do anything for this group of 200,000 workers.  One must ask therefore why theGovernment is singling out this group of workers to be left high and dry over the summer months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">If the Government wanted to deal with this matter it could have done so, but it has made choices.  Neither the IMF nor anyone else is stopping the Government from doing this, so all it takes is the political will.  It is a pity, however, that in this case it is not in evidence today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">I am also concerned about the pension schemes that are now only one step away from being struck down by any challenge, say, in the construction industry.  A lot of work has gone into that over the years whereby employers in the construction industry contributed to a pension fund for their employees.  People contributed to those funds over a period of time, but the same threat hangs over those pension schemes as with other agreements that have not been specifically brought before the courts.  People therefore have a legitimate concern about current and future contributions, as well as the management of those pension schemes, especially in the construction sector.  That matter has not been highlighted to any great extent, however.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">I accept that the overwhelming majority of employers are good business people.  They create jobs and most of them are responsible, but there is an unscrupulous element who will try to win a contract at a lower price by undercutting, getting out of their pension liabilities and avoiding paying traditional industry rates.  In addition, such employers may use foreign nationals to clean local authority and government offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">Where contracts are being paid for by public funds, whether it is to build a school or pay catering staff in a Government office, agency or local authority, there should be some method of on-site inspection to ensure staff in those areas are being paid the proper rate along with proper social welfare deductions.  It is important to give fair play to good employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">I compliment Deputy O'Dea for bringing forward this Bill.  I acknowledge the Government's goodwill in not voting it down, but I would like them to follow through by letting the Bill progress to Committee Stage.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_774">
            <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk</from>
            <p eId="para_1722">I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill in the limited time available.  I support the Fianna Fáil-sponsored Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2011.  I wish to compliment our colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, on bringing this legislation before the House with a considerable degree of urgency.  The reason we are pushing ahead with this Bill is because of the ineptitude of the current Government in dealing with this crisis.  Following the ruling on 7 July in the High Court, some 200,000 people are at risk and face lower rates of pay and inferior working conditions.  The Government promised to address the situation with the utmost urgency, but that simply has not happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">Deputy O'Dea has introduced this legislation to remedy the constitutional issues related to JLCs in order to protect workers.  Unions have describe the situation as devastating for employees.  It is worth bearing in mind that it was Fianna Fáil, under the late Seán Lemass, that introduced the JLC system in 1946.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">Prior to the High Court ruling it was clear there was a major rift brewing between the coalition parties over the reforms of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to the JLC system, which went beyond those proposed by the Duffy-Walsh report.  Workers already face hard times from the recent ECB interest rate increases.  In addition, imminent household utility charges are coming down the tracks, including for water and perhaps septic tank charges in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">Fine Gael and Labour have broken a number of promises in relation to the JLCs.  Those who care about the people affected would like to see the Government focus specifically on this issue.  Who will represent the interests and needs of the 200,000 people who are directly affected?  Following the ruling, the Government promised that it would move immediately to introduce temporary measures to protect vulnerable workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, said the matter was being explored "with the utmost urgency" and an announcement would be made as soon as a specific course of action had been decided upon.  However, the Government has reneged on this, saying that no legislation will be brought forward before the summer recess.  Clearly, the Minister simply does not understand the meaning of the term "urgent".  It is not good enough that thousands of vulnerable workers will be left in a precarious position while the Government goes off on its summer break.  The Government had acknowledged the seriousness of the situation, but is still dragging its heels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">On 12 July 2011, the Taoiseach told the Dáil:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1728">The vulnerability of some workers is of concern... There are now limited protections for workers because of contracts entered into.  This is a matter the Government feels should be responded to as quickly as possible.  It will not, however, be possible for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to have the matter rectified before the summer recess.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">A study published in the <i>Industrial Relations Journal</i> in January 2011 found that two thirds of respondents surveyed considered that JLCs were still necessary in addition to the national minimum wage, while a third thought that they were not necessary.  The study is entitled “Minimum labour standards in a social partnership system: the persistence of the Irish variant of wages councils”.  Its authors, Michelle O’Sullivan and Joseph Wallace, found that the overwhelming majority of trade union and independent members believed JLCs were necessary.  Employer members were most likely to hold the view that JLCs were no longer necessary, but there was no consensus among them.  A substantial minority of one third of employer respondents believed JLCs were necessary.  The reasons with the strongest employer support — 33% of those covered — were that “JLCs are necessary because they tailor minimum pay and conditions to the specific industry/employment covered”, and that “JLCs are necessary because they try to prevent employer undercutting”.  Other well supported reasons were that “JLCs provide a negotiating forum for generally non-unionised workers”, and that “JLCs set more minimum conditions of employment than provided in employment legislation”.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">As Members will have gleaned from Opposition contributions, we are all supportive of what Deputy Willie O'Dea is proposing in this Private Members' Bill.  We are glad the Government has agreed to allow it to progress to Second Stage, but there are other stages to be negotiated.  Hopefully, the Government will recognise the merit of the legislation, support it and allow it through all stages.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_775">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_1731">In the context of a debate on JLCs and employment rights generally, it is important to emphasise that the vast majority, by which I mean 90% plus, of employers are decent and committed to the well-being of their employees.  They are conscious of how that well-being contributes to the overall success of their businesses.  The happiness of employees contributes to the success of service industries and other areas covered by JLCs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">Over the past three years, the vast majority of employers have faced unprecedented challenges, as they have tried to keep their doors open and retain people in employment.  The machinery around EROs and JLCs, which has been ruled down by the recent judgment, proved itself to be inflexible and unhelpful in that task.  I came across many situations, both as a Deputy and a Minister, where there was workplace agreement within companies on a temporary adjustment or change in conditions, but this could not be pursued because of the limitations of the then existing legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">We are lucky to have an excellent team of departmental officials who are dealing with this area.  We have prepared legislation in this respect.  Over the past two nights, I have listened to the <i>cri du coeur</i> from Labour Party Deputies in particular, bewailing where that legislation went.  Because of our wish to consult with many organisations, including their own military wing in SIPTU, we were delayed in preparing and introducing that legislation.  We were ultimately overtaken by the financial, economic and political events of last autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">It is a difficult circle to square.  On the one hand, we do not want to give an unfair competitive advantage to unscrupulous employers by allowing them to drive a coach and four through employment rights legislation.  However, we must give a chance to businesses that are struggling and that want to do the decent thing.  The redesign of JLCs must incorporate flexibilities and must show a recognition that the economic ways of doing things today are very different from those of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s when this system took hold.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">We now have the judgment and there are several operational issues I would like to put to the Minister of State. I appreciate he might not be able to give us a response this evening, but if we could get it before the end of the recess, that would be great.  What is the status of any ongoing National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, investigations into breaches of JLC regulations?  Can he confirm that NERA has begun to withdraw prosecutions related to JLC regulations and pay rates? Given that the system has been ruled as unconstitutional, is it possible that any company or organisation previously found guilty of offences under the legislation might have recourse to seek repayment of damages, fines and legal fees?</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">The judgment has presented us with a good chance to redraw the industrial relations system.  We should never waste a crisis and we should get the combined knowledge of everyone involved to produce a system that is fit for purpose in 21st century Ireland.  I welcome the appointment of Mr. Ger Deering to bring the various employment rights agencies together.  That system is incredibly complex and it does not assist employees seeking redress, nor does it assist employers.  The Bearing Point report, which was prepared by the last Government, as well as the Croke Park agreement and the changes that this is making to Departments, will provide Mr. Deering with a good road map in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">We must be realistic.  Our economy is in such a situation that this requires a rapid response.  It requires a response that realises that inflexibility costs jobs and that the old ways of doing things has to be different.  We can do things differently by offering protection to employees and by deterring rogue employers, but let us do so quickly and without any further unnecessary delay.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_776">
            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
            <p eId="para_1738">I commend Deputy O'Dea on his prompt response to the decision by the High Court to rule joint labour committee agreements as unconstitutional by bringing forward this Bill.  It is particularly unfortunate, as we come into the last week of this Dáil session, that this decision has come upon us and it has made for a difficult scenario.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in spite of his commitment to deal with this urgently following the ruling, has delayed it until the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">The JLCs and employment agreements go back a long time, while it is more than 100 years since the minimum wage was first introduced in Britain and Ireland.  The JLC structure came into place in 1946.  It served a real purpose by offering protection to employees and ensuring those who have demands on them due to the nature of their work have fair and equitable employment conditions for the job they carry out.  However, it has also served many employers well.  We want to achieve a situation whereby the industrial relations structure of the State allows for employers to operate in a way which ensures they provide an efficient service to their customers, but which also ensures employees have good terms and conditions in order that they can have the quality of life that all citizens wish to achieve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">It is not surprising that a study published in the <i>Industrial Relations News </i>found that there was much less support for JLC agreements among employers than among employees, but it also found that there was significant support for those agreements among employers, with over one third of employers expressing a need for them.  This is an acknowledgment of the fact that well-treated employees are important for any business.  In the absence of such agreements, these employers want to ensure that in providing a business and a service to their customers, they are also providing a good standard of employment to their employees and are not undercut by other people who may be less scrupulous.  This can lead to a race to the bottom.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">A rational understanding of the merit of JLCs shows that we need to continue with this kind of system.  However, we must also ensure the system is responsive and there have been issues with it over recent years.  JLCs were in place in the building industry which led to inflated prices and costs for construction.  As the squeeze came on that industry, many employers and employees found it difficult to come to new agreements which reflected the times in which we were living, even though many wanted to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">We have an opportunity to bring in a framework which ensures that employees are protected but which also works well for employers who have at heart the concern for employees.  Unfortunately, the Minister's reluctance to move on this quickly will mean that over the next few months, new employees will be employed under conditions very different to those with existing conditions.  Employees could be working side by side under very different terms.  I urge the Minister of State to give this urgent consideration and I commend Deputy O'Dea on bringing the Bill before the House.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy John Perry)</from>
            <p eId="para_1743">I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  The Government has stated it will not be opposing Second Stage of this Bill.  Speakers on the Government side of the House have expressed their appreciation for the intention behind Deputy O'Dea's Bill, since its aim is to protect vulnerable workers.  However, as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, have both stated in the House, the legal advice available to the Government is crystal clear.  The Bill as drafted is not sufficiently robust to deal with the problem Deputy O'Dea seeks to solve.  While the intentions are good, unfortunately, the Bill is not adequate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">The measure proposed by Deputy O'Dea is premature.  The judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Feeney on 7 July 2011 has so far only been made available in draft form.  It has not been finalised.  The declaration to which the High Court has said the plaintiffs are entitled has also to be finalised.  The Bill is, moreover, insufficient as it does not address the potentially far-reaching consequences of the recent High Court judgement, nor is it likely to prove a bulwark against further legal challenges.  We need legislation in this area that will withstand challenge.  There is no point in proceeding with half-measures that will only be found to be faulty before long.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2011 is not adequate to meet the need arising from the recent High Court judgment as it does not contain a sufficiently comprehensive range of reform proposals and cannot guarantee that the limited additional safeguards it seeks to put in place would survive legal challenge.  Deputy O'Dea's Bill relies on a "cut and paste" approach by importing the main provisions of the now lapsed Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, without taking into account the series of specific changes to the legislative framework put forward in the recommendations of the independent review report.  It also fails to respond effectively to the more difficult issues raised in the High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Feeney, delivered on 7 July 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">Concerns were raised yesterday and again this evening by a number of Deputies regarding the potential for exploitation of vulnerable workers by unscrupulous employers.  While the vast majority of workers behave responsibly, there will undoubtedly be a small minority who may seek to exploit the High Court decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">Workers covered by an employment regulation order, ERO, that fixed minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to be protected by their individual contracts of employment, whether written or verbal, which in many cases already incorporate the minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment set by whatever ERO may have covered their employment.  Any question of a change to an employee's contractual entitlement is essentially a matter to be agreed between each employee and their employer where this is not already a matter dealt with through collective agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">Where an employee is concerned about a possible breach of his or her existing contract of employment he or she can make a complaint under employment law by direct access to the employment rights bodies or in the law courts.  Any workers seeking information about how they can bring complaints about variations in pay or deductions made without their agreement should contact NERA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">The fact that the process of making EROs has been found by the High Court to be unconstitutional, together with the identified lack of adequate Oireachtas scrutiny of this process, only underscores some of the main features of the recommendations for reform that were put forward by the independent review report on these statutory wage setting mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">Deputies on different sides of this House have recalled the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, which was introduced by the last Government, but allowed to lapse after being left on the Order Paper for 12 months.  That Bill had sought to address the vulnerability of both the JLC and REA systems.  What is now required is a comprehensive reform measure that can address all of the recommendations for reform that were put forward by the independent review report on these statutory wage setting mechanisms as well as the implications of the recent High Court judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1750">The comprehensive reform proposals that have already been the subject of discussions with stakeholders and at Government will go some way in addressing the weaknesses identified by the court, and would therefore restore protection for workers in the relevant sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">Now the priority is to proceed with the preparation of comprehensive reform proposals since the implications of the High Court judgment for our wage setting mechanisms are not confined to the joint labour committee system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">The wide-ranging recommendations of the independent review report underscored the need to bring forward a substantive reform measure.  The High Court ruling has posed an even greater challenge.  Premature half-measures that tackle only some of these serious issues will not suffice to meet that challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has said it considers that the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 can serve as a foundation for the necessary further work.  ICTU considers, however, that the best course of action would now be to bring forward substantive legislation to deal with the problem.  This means comprehending the recommendations of the independent review report by Kevin Duffy and Dr. Frank Walsh in the form of substantive legislation.  Taking into account the High Court judgment, the Government is determined to proceed with urgency to a substantial reform of the current JLC/REA regulatory system in order to protect existing jobs in these vulnerable sectors of the economy and to increase the likelihood of employment in these sectors being increased.  The Government's intention is that legislation will be introduced to the Dáil very early in the next term with prioritised enactment thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1754">On the question Deputy Calleary raised, I will forward him that detail.</p>

            <p eId="para_1755">Tá áthas orm an deis cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille.  We should reflect on where this process started.  The starting point was when the previous Government instituted a review of the JLC system but what was not envisaged was that the total system would collapse.  All of us agree there is need for change but change should happen in a controlled and focused way.  Because of a court case taken and a ruling in the High Court that has not been appealed by the Government, the whole edifice has been knocked down.  All we have been told is that if we wait long enough we will get a new edifice.  The strategy being put forward by the Government is that we should wait and it will create a new edifice, but my concern is that the starting point of that edifice will not be the situation that pertained until the High Court gave its ruling, which was that there were very specific protections for workers, which might have been amended or adjusted to deal with the new issues that have arisen in our time.  The Government will start from a point where there will be no defence other than the minimum wage and the basic standard law for workers and from that point that it will build.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1757">That is a fact.  That could be the legal situation and once it starts with that legal situation and time passes employers will start employing people under the new conditions: why would they not do so?  Then when the Minister tries to bring in his law there will be a huge outcry from employers to the effect that he cannot do so because they are employing people under conditions that are inferior to his law.  If the conditions are inferior to the law, perhaps that is the reason for the delay in the Government's approach to this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">There is a conflict between the people who sit on this side and those who sit on that side of the House as to the approach that should be taken.  The free marketeers in Fine Gael would like to drop the whole thing but the Labour Party is very wedded to it.  There is an ideological conflict between them, which is understandable because the two parties claimed prior to the election that they were totally different.  Why would there not be ideological differences between them?  It would be amazing if two parties which said their ideologies were different before the election suddenly found they had no ideological differences once they got into Cabinet and, if that were so, one of them would have had to have been telling us fibs prior to the election.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">By holding off in bringing forward legislation, it is one up for the Minister.  The baseline of where we are starting from is zero whereas if legislation was in place, the baseline would be that legislation.  Therefore, I am concerned as to what the intentions are in regard to legislation in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">I accept that in most small businesses there is very little paperwork, dealings with unions and so on but a particular feature of 80% to 90% of good small businesses that I know is that there is great cohesion between the worker and the management and they very rarely have recourse to any of the industrial machinery unless there is a major breakdown on one or other side and they often relate to personality issues.  In long-established good small businesses, the reality is that the employers know that without committed workers getting a fair return there would be no business because it is much more of a team effort and it is much more based on personal relationships.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">In larger and more impersonal businesses, there is a temptation to take a money view because of the sheer number of employees and the personal relationship element is not such a feature.  Employees in such businesses can often themselves in a vulnerable situation.  An employer employing 200, 300, 400 or 500 employers who can save so much a week, rather than considering the importance of the personal relationships between management and workers because such relationships are not immediately identifiable because they are immediately available, may avail of that opportunity to make a cash saving.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">It is funny that it has been said that in the interim period nobody will move to take advantage of the situation.  We were surprised that an appeal was not submitted on foot of the judgment.  If an appeal had been submitted, everything would be stalled until the appeal was heard and we could then move forward and introduce a Bill before the law was struck down, but we are not in that situation.  I was surprised by the naive view that no employers will take advantage of the position now that the wall has been knocked down.  I find that strange.  I will mention two cases where people tried to circumvent the law to save money on wages.  Does the Minister remember the famous Irish Ferries dispute?  It certainly was not within the spirit of what we would like to happen here but the question arose of whether it was legal.  Aer Lingus also let staff go before hiring them again on less favourable terms.  It is not believable that somebody working in a non-unionised operation on a casual basis will be able to argue past legal cases with a powerful employer to defend his or her position if the latter finds an apparently legal means of reducing terms of employment ahead of the proposed Bill.  It is like telling somebody who is deeply unhappy about a decision to appeal it to the High Court on a point of law when that person does not know where to find the money to take on a court case.  In the mundane world where ordinary people work, it is disingenuous to suggest it is sufficient to rely on verbal contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">We propose that the Minister should accept this Bill for now and, once he has had his proposals debated in Cabinet, he can bring forward a better system.  The basic premise is to address the weakness in the system as it existed heretofore.  Nobody is against change.  We all recognise that parts of the system had to be adjusted to the new realities in which we must work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">We are hearing a narrative from powerful business interests that if only they could persuade ordinary workers to take less, our economic woes would be solved.  I do not agree with the Cuban solution of being poor and happy while refusing to pursue economic wealth.  However, I am also far from believing that the pursuit of wealth and notional increases to GNP creates a good standard of living in itself.  I would argue that the Cuban model simply makes everyone poor and I believe in the creation of wealth but it must be fairly distributed.  Those who measure the success of a country purely in GNP terms miss the point of why we emphasise economic growth and wealth creation.  I am not concerned with how wealthy people may be but I am concerned with how poor they are.  I do not begrudge somebody who owns a few million euro as long as it has not been earned at the disadvantage of those who are struggling to make ends meet.  If somebody is making money by creating wealth in society, I have no problem with it but if he or she is helping to create an unequal society in which the poor are in the majority, that is the wrong vision.  I do not agree with the narrative that as long as the people at the bottom cut their cloth to measure, all will be right with the world.  Having worked in the area of job development, I see the creation of employment as a means of bringing improvements in people's lifestyles and giving them opportunities to work within their own communities.  I did not object if those who created the jobs enjoyed a reasonable living as a result but the current narrative worries me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">I ask the Government to accept the need for this Bill.  It is not unusual when the High Court strikes down legislation that we would deal with the specific point of law that was called into question, which is what the Bill does.  The Minister can continue to pursue his agenda of long-term reform.  I do not need to give him advice because he has been around this House for a long time but all of us who have had the privilege of serving as a Minister or Minister of State understand what it is like to ask when legislation will be ready.  We take it at face value when we are told it will take several months and that we are 80% there after six months.  However, the delay arises in perfecting the Bill.  Every Government I dealt with in this House failed to deliver on the timeframes for their legislative promises.  Having been in the system for a long time, I understand why this happens.  It is easy enough to get the legislation to 80% of perfection but the final 20% will drive the Minister mad.  It will be over and back and subject to negotiation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">The Government's proposals for industrial reform will be subject to endless negotiations between the Labour Party and Fine Gael and we will wait a long time before legislation comes before this House.  The proposals will require detailed debate when we finally receive them and the Bill should not be guillotined.  If the Seanad is still around when the Minister manages to publish a Bill, he can figure out for himself how long it will take before it can be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

If we had a unicameral Parliament, I wonder how we would make all these amendments.  This is why it is important that Bills go before both Houses to perfect the language used in them.  Before the Government moves to abolish the Seanad, I suggest it should carry out a survey of all the amendments made by the second House to receive the Bills, whether that was the Seanad or the Dáil.  Such a survey will indicate that a bicameral system is required and that the proposals to abolish the Seanad are purely populist and without foundation.</p>

        <heading>Common Fisheries Policy Reform: Statements</heading>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_788">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
          <p eId="para_1775">I propose to share time with Deputies Harrington and McHugh.</p>
          <p eId="para_1776">Our purpose this evening is to discuss the Common Fisheries Policy which was debated yesterday for the first time in a real sense at the European Council when the Commissioner presented her policy reform document to Ministers.  I welcome much of what is contained in the document and the principle behind many of the objectives set regarding the introduction of reforms.  In particular, the Government is very supportive of ensuring the sustainability of stocks, with the maximum sustainable yield to be reached through stock management when and where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1777">There are, however, a number of proposed reforms outlined by the Commission which we cannot support, or at least not in their current format.  The first is the proposal to fundamentally change the way in which we allocate quotas across the European Union.  Quotas are currently treated as a national asset to be distributed by governments to fishing fleets in consultations between the government and the industry.  That is certainly what happens in Ireland.  We have done this successfully with a relatively small quota to keep our fishing communities intact and fishing harbours busy.  It is being proposed that we move away from political control of the allocation of fishing quotas to what is termed an individual transferable fishing concession or fishing quota.  In other words, we would be moving towards privatising the long-term use of quotas, although not ownership.  Boats would be able to transfer between them a quota for payment.  In other words, what the Commissioner would like to facilitate is consolidation within the industry, reducing the number of boats in the fleet and allowing trawlers with buying power to purchase quota from those looking to get out of the industry.  We cannot support this and fear, in particular, that not only would we see consolidation of the industry in two or three ports in Ireland which would damage other fishing communities but also the potential for quota to be transferred from the Irish fleet.  The Spanish fleet is an obvious issue in this respect as it is too big for the size of its quota and must buy more.  The Commissioner has insisted that her proposal will result in quota being transferred within member states only.  We do not see how she can prevent quota from being transferred out of Ireland.  That is something we cannot accept and will not support.  There needs to be much more discussion on how we reach maximum sustainable yield for fish stocks.  We need to consider how we can adopt a species-by-species, fish-by-fish approach.  I will work in consultation with the industry and the Commissioner to try to get to where she wants to go.  I do not think it can be imposed as quickly as she is proposing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1778">I strongly agree with what the Commissioner is trying to do about discards.  She wants to end the indefensible practice whereby huge volumes of dead fish, including juvenile fish and fish that were caught out of quota, are discarded over the sides of boats by people who do not have a quota to bring them ashore.  However, the Commissioner's proposal, which involves simply banning all discards in a relatively short period of time, is simply not workable for a country like Ireland that has a mixed fishery.  When one is trying to catch haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea, one will catch cod at the same time.  If one does not have a quota for cod, one cannot bring it ashore.</p>
          <p eId="para_1779">Given that cod stocks are pretty strong in the Celtic Sea at the moment, it is crazy in a mixed fishery that dead mature fish which are suitable for the market have to be ditched by fishermen who do not have a quota to catch them.  We need to make significant progress on the discards argument.  Apart from the damage it does to stocks, it is immoral that we are dumping approximately 400,000 tonnes of dead fish into Irish waters each year.  We can deal with discards in a way that makes sense by working with the industry.  Ireland has been very progressive in terms of putting together pilot projects to make a positive impact on the discards problem.  We will continue to do that in the coming year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1780">I welcome the fact that a full discussion on the Common Fisheries Policy proposals is taking place.  I welcome the Commissioner's willingness to listen to different points of view.  I look forward to working with the Commission to find an acceptable compromise.  I hope that can happen during the Irish Presidency in the first six months of 2013, or before then if possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelHarrington" eId="spk_789">
          <from>Deputy Noel Harrington</from>
          <p eId="para_1781">I thank the Minister for agreeing to share time.  One could spend 15 hours discussing the Common Fisheries Policy without touching on everything one would like to address.  Although fishing is not a nationally popular or well-versed industry, unfortunately, it is the main industry in some parts of the country.  The impact of the decisions taken under the Common Fisheries Policy has a huge bearing on the operation of the industry in coastal communities throughout the country.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will make the Irish case strongly at the European negotiations to get the best deal for Ireland under the policy for the next eight, ten or dozen years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1782">The reality is that the Common Fisheries Policy we now have is a broken model.  It was drawn up with the best of intentions to provide for communities while conserving fish stocks.  The quota system that is in place simply has not worked.  It needs a fundamental reform.  It is right that the quota system proposed by Commissioner Damanaki should be opposed by this country.  I am glad the Minister intends to resist it firmly at the European negotiations.  That is important because the individual fishing quotas that have been proposed by the Commissioner would have a detrimental effect on the Irish fishing industry if they were allowed to go through.  A great deal of work needs to be done in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1783">I would like to speak about the issue of discards.  It is a crime, essentially, to throw dead fish — good food — overboard.  It is legal to catch it, but it is illegal to land it.  Quite frankly, it is difficult to know how it should be dealt with.  If one brings non-quota or over-quota species onto the quays, it will affect the market and have an impact on the individual quota allocation of one's vessel.  It is a difficult challenge to try to minimise discards on the seas.  I hope we will find a way of resolving it successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_1784">I hope the Hague preferences, which we have successfully negotiated and renegotiated in recent years during the most recent reviews of the Common Fisheries Policy, will be maintained.  We will support the Minister's efforts to maintain these preferential agreements on the Irish fishing industry.  That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1785">I hope we will have a united front when Ireland's case is being made during the negotiations that will take place as part of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy.  We need to build alliances of like-minded allies in Europe.  That happened when it was proposed to impose sanctions on the Faroe Islands and Iceland, for example.  When those countries tore agreements asunder, they damaged the shared mackerel stock that is important for the European fishing industry.  It is important we put forward a united front.  We should support the Minister, the Department and the officials when they make Ireland's case in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1786">It is a sad fact that fishing is not a very well industry, by and large.  That is a challenge for those of us in this Parliament who are interested in the fishing industry.  We use terms like "refrigerated sea water", "polyvalent", "pelagic" and "demersal", which are as fundamental to the fishing industry as terms like "tillage", "dairy", "cattle" and "dry suckler" are to the agriculture industry.  Farming terms are well understood in this Chamber, whereas the fishing terms I mentioned are well understood by a minority of Members but vaguely understood or disregarded by a majority of Members.  The challenge for Deputies who represent coastal communities is to try to rectify that and bring the fishing industry to the fore of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1787">I am glad to have had an opportunity to speak on the Common Fisheries Policy.  I hope we can reach consensus and show a united front in the interests of an industry that badly needs the help of this Chamber.  This much maligned industry, which is under severe pressure, is of great importance in areas that are facing constant economic and social pressure.  We need to reverse the unfortunate trend whereby we import the fish we eat and export the fish we catch.  We should try to do the best we can to maximise the onshore resource that is our fishing industry.  I am grateful to the Minister for sharing time with me.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_790">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_1788">In the short amount of time available to me, I will not go over the historical issues, such as transferable quotas, discards and Hague preferences, which were covered by my colleagues.  I wish the Minister well in the ongoing negotiations.  He is the right person in the right job at the right time.  It is important to put into context where our fishing industry is at by referring to the psyche or general feeling within the industry.  It is battered and bruised and has been pulled and dragged all over the place.  We have completely obliterated the potential of our inshore fisheries.  That does not have positive ramifications for the industry itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_1789">I do not propose to focus on negative or historical aspects of the industry, however.  I will not dwell on the fact that non-Irish fishing vessels have extracted approximately €500 billion worth of fish from Irish seas since we joined the EU.  I do not think it would be productive to do so.  It would not help the debate.  We have to be cognisant of the fact that we have an international job to do.  We have to look at things in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy negotiations.  We have to consider the fact that the Faroese and Icelandic governments are allocating ridiculous mackerel quotas at the moment.  That has the potential to wipe out this country's mackerel sector.  Representatives of our mackerel sector have told me they are absolutely disgusted with what is going on.  They know it is not even the right time of the year to be fishing mackerel.  We need to pull in the pioneers, the ambassadors in the mackerel industry whom we have in this country, because they want to lead the campaign against this outlandish activity by the Faroese and Icelandic governments.  For example, as we speak there is a re-calibrated oil tanker cargo ship processing fish off the Faroe Islands.  This is the reality of what is happening.  We need international clout.  The Minister, from his experience in Europe, must use the EU as a mechanism to work together with our comrades in Canada and right across international shores to come up with mechanisms for preventing the type of mass destruction that is going on within international waters, be it by Russian factory ships or whatever.  For example, the Greenland authorities are introducing their own quota system and catching salmon and we are introducing severe restrictions for drift-net fishermen and draft-net fishermen for fish that are being completely exploited in international waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1790">We need one voice within the fishing sector.  One of the self-criticisms within the fishing industry is that it did not have one voice.  It is a challenge for the fishing industry.  I call on those within the fishing sector to look at it as an industry with potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_1791">The Minister has been focused on the aquaculture sector.  However, we need a break at the inshore.  We need a break where there are fishermen in my constituency.  Only yesterday, a fisherman from Urris, County Donegal telephoned me, not about going fishing because he knows he cannot do so but about going out in one of the BIM survey boats just to get out in the water.  We must look at our psyche as a nation.  We are a maritime nation, we have a coastal community, we are an island and we have to get people back in the waters.  This was an example of a fisherman who had fished all his life — generations down through the years fished in Irish waters — and all he wants to do is to get out on the sea on a BIM survey boat.  He cannot get out otherwise because of ridiculous rules that have been introduced down the years.  Another example up in our waters is fishermen who have been fishing lesser spotted dogfish, known locally as sand dogs, which is a scavenger used as bait and for which they cannot get a quota.</p>
          <p eId="para_1792">There are so many challenges.  I wish the Minister well.  I encourage the industry to come collectively with one voice.  It is important to lead the debate and lead the drive in an industry that has given away €500 billion worth of fish to non-Irish vessels.  That is a fact of history and we must do something about that in terms of driving a more positive future for those within the marine sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_791">
          <from>Deputy John Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_1793">I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Cuív.  I thank the Minister for bringing the debate to the House tonight.  He told me during the week that he would try to have a debate here before we adjourned for the holidays and it is important we recognise that he has come forward here tonight and given us an opportunity to talk about CFP reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1794">I was Minister of State in the Department when then Commissioner Borg introduced the Green Paper in 2008.  Obviously, it is a slow, tedious process.  There were in the region of 17,000 responses to the Green Paper at the time and one can imagine the difficulties in teasing out all the different points of view put forward.  I appreciate that the Minister has a difficulty on his hands right across the EU in the sense that he is dealing with some of the big players such as the French and the Spanish, all of whom want to protect and hold what they have.  At that time, I remember Commissioner Borg stating there would be a radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.  I do not know whether the Minister would describe what was put to him during the week as radical.  I would contend it is not in so far as Irish fishermen are concerned.  This will probably drag on until 2012 or probably 2013 before we get a final decision on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1795">There are a number of issues for fishermen, some of whom are in contact with me — like many Deputies, I come from a coastal county — and the Minister himself has referred to them.  The fishermen are concerned that the introduction of mandatory transferable quota rights for all member states would be detrimental to the Irish fishing industry as it would be only a matter of time before the Irish fishing industry was in the hands of large European companies.  The Irish fishing industry is entitled to know how the European Commission can legally ring-fence the buying and selling of quota to individual member states in order that our quota does not end up in foreign ownership.  In his reply, the Minister might outline his views on this area.  Transferable quota rights must be introduced on a voluntary basis, if they are to be introduced at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1796">The area of discards is a contentious issue which will not be resolved overnight, something on which I agree with the Minister.  We need to bring forward suitable incentives to address the problem of discards effectively.  The reality is that it is not practicable or environmentally favourable to land everything that is caught.  The discards proposal must be based on the principles of avoidance, minimisation and incentives.  Landing dead fish defeats the purpose.  This is a key area on which the European Parliament will need to come forward with practical solutions to minimise the discarding to the lowest possible levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1797">The fishermen are also concerned that there is not greater regionalisation of the Common Fisheries Policy.  They feel it has been watered down to such an extent by the Commission that the proposal put forward will not deliver any meaningful regionalisation.  The existing one-size-fits-all policy has failed to deliver for Irish fishermen, and this is their concern.  This is a lost opportunity to introduce regional management structures that have the potential to a create simpler, cheaper and more effective CFP.  Localised management structures with devolved powers have many positive effects, including increased responsibility on the part of stakeholders and a CFP more sensitive to local concerns.  It is important that the Minister would continue to battle in this particular area to bring forward effective and workable regional management measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1798">I welcome the establishment of a separate regime for small-scale fisheries.  However, as currently proposed, it will exclude a large portion of the Irish fleet.  It is important to recognise that all boats under 15 m in length must be included under these new provisions.  Over 80% of the Irish fleet are small boats under 15 m in length, fishing mainly inshore and off small coastal islands in rough Atlantic waters.  These boats are of considerable importance to the fishing communities around the coastline.  It is also important to recognise that in many cases there is no alternative employment and that is an area where the Minister must take stock of what the fishermen are saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_1799">It is also important to recognise some good points of the Lisbon treaty.  One of them is that the European Parliament, the MEPs from all political parties and none representing this country, will have a direct role in the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.  It is important that Irish MEPs would have their voices heard to ensure some of the concerns and difficulties facing Irish fishermen would be addressed through the CFP.  They need to deal with the provision of the quota transfer rights, the discard measures and regionalisation.  From speaking to Mr. Pat "The Cope" Gallagher, MEP and MEPs from other political parties in this country, they will be keeping an eye out and playing a role in ensuring the Minister will have full support in his battle to ensure Irish fishermen get a fair deal from the reform of the CFP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1800">The other area which arises every Christmas, which I dealt with and which the Minister dealt with last Christmas, is the Hague resolution.  Fishermen would like this to be written in some form into the CFP proposals with which the Minister will be dealing.  It happens on the table every Christmas where some countries want to take off the Hague preference, there is a row and the Irish fishermen insist on it being kept on.  I am aware that the Federation of Irish Fishermen issued a statement following the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, proposals last week.  They specifically called for the Hague preferences to be a <i>de facto</i> feature of the distribution of quota between countries.  They are keen for this to be written in stone in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1801">I wish to raise two further issues to which the Minister might respond, although he does not have much time to do so.  The fishing industry is important to the country with approximately 11,000 people employed directly or indirectly.  There are great opportunities in Europe now since 65% of fish is imported from outside the EU.  There are important opportunities for Irish fishermen in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1802">Deputy McHugh raised the issue of mackerel.  Last Sunday, I read in a UK newspaper about great concern being expressed about the breakdown between the Faroe Islands, Iceland and the EU.  There is indiscriminate fishing of mackerel now which will cause major problems for the mackerel industry in future, especially for Irish fishermen.  What action does the Minister intend to take in this area?  The headline stated "Super trawlers sail in to obliterate stocks of mackerel".  As Deputy McHugh suggested, huge boats and factory-type ships are now running wild on the mackerel industry.  Will the Minister comment on this?</p>
          <p eId="para_1803">At an IFA meeting last night I met our friend Richie Flynn from the IFA who deals with the aquaculture industry.  It is important that the Minister deals effectively with the aquaculture industry.  This is not an easy problem to solve because of the licensing system.  However, I call on the Minister to try to put in place a system that would speed up the issuing of existing licences and new licences in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1807">That is right.  I try to be good every day.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this subject.  When we joined the European Union I was publically opposed to it and I campaigned against it.  One of the main grounds on which I campaigned was that we would be selling away forever and a day our fishing rights.  At the time the argument was that we would get plenty of money for the farmers.  I remember predicting at the time that the day would come when the money for the farmers would reduce because any grant system is vulnerable to reduction and we would find that we had sold the huge wealth that is our fishing waters around the coast.</p>
          <p eId="para_1808">It annoys me to this day that peculiarly among all the assets of the European Union the one they insist that small countries share with the big countries is the fishing rights.  The reasons fishing rights above any other rights must be shared on a communautaire basis is because it suits the big and powerful countries.  I put it to the Minister that we can argue around the edges of this but great damage has been done to our potential as a nation to reap a dividend from the fantastic resources we have.  My understanding is that we have approximately 4% of the fish available to us but 14% of the waters.</p>

My suggestion to the Government is that the next time President Sarkozy mentions anything about corporation tax, the Government should make it clear that before it will discuss that, there is an issue that it wishes to open up, that is, we want our fishing waters back.</p>

          <p eId="para_1831">I am sure he would suggest that we could have a rational and reasonable discussion about it and further that he would agree fully that we could solve the Irish financial problems by giving back to the Irish Government its entitlements.  I have no doubt that since I have suggested this here tonight, the Minister will in turn suggest it to the Taoiseach who will see it as being a rational.  I do not say this jocosely; I mean it seriously and it would put right something which I made clear was wrong back in 1973.  I have never changed my mind on that issue because it is a natural resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_1832">One of the great questions raised all the time about the attitude towards fisheries in Europe is whether Europe is all about money and big companies or the people.  I represent a coastal constituency and I see the decimation that has taken place in coastal communities because they do not have access to their own resources which are out in the bay beyond them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1833">The only argument I was ever given on this matter was that we had not developed our fishing industry enough in 1973 and that was why we were willing to give it away.  It is like suggesting that one has a farm but because one has not been using it for one reason or another one may as well give the farm away because one has not stocked it.  Any farmer in the country would make it clear he would never do that and that he would never give away the land because he could always restock the land if he owned the farm but if he gave away the land he would not be able to restock it because he would not have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1834">It is time this country started talking tough.  I do not share the view with my colleague that bringing the European Parliament into this would be of great benefit.  We have only a small number of MEPs out of 800.</p>

Countries that have no sea resources and a disproportionate amount of our resources will out-vote and out-muscle our very good MEPs, who are in a tiny minority in that situation.  The only way this can be tackled is at government to government level.  We have a unique opportunity now with the talks going on in Europe to put this back on the table and make it clear that we no longer accept it.  If others wish to re-open things, we wish to re-open things and this is a fundamental thing we wish to re-open.  We sold the fisheries for the farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_1837">Where I live now, Europe, through its designations, is virtually strangling the life of ordinary people.  They cannot do on their own land what they have done traditionally as custodians of that land.  We have a major issue with the designations on the land and in the sea.  They are stopping our people.  The building of small piers becomes very difficult because of the Natura 2000 designation.  There is a great deal that we should raise in Europe and there was never a better time to raise these issues in Europe because the Europeans are looking for things from us.  For everything they seek, we should seek it back ten times more.</p>

          <p eId="para_1844">We can all agree that the Common Fisheries Policy has been a bad deal for Ireland.  All sides accept that and it is not the Minister's fault.  He did not negotiate it.  However, it is a reality that we must address and a fact that we must change.  To say our waters have been plundered by our EU partners is not putting it too strongly.  We gave away a most valuable resource in our coastal waters.  It is no wonder the level of employment in the fishing, maritime and ancillary industries has fallen consistently and dramatically since we gave away these natural resources.  It is also no wonder that those who love fishing, the sea and related industries are as frustrated as they are at what they see as the continuing throwing away of our resources, which is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1845">Like Deputy Ó Cuív, I spoke out at the time we joined the European Union.  I said one inevitable consequence of signing up would be the selling out of our fisheries.  Unfortunately, there were not many on Deputy Ó Cuív's side of the House who agreed with me and my party and with my analysis.  I commend Deputy Ó Cuív on his foresight and honesty in speaking up when he did.</p>
          <p eId="para_1846">Before the publication of the reform proposals, I had hoped they would open up a new era for fisheries in the European Union, one that would benefit Irish and European fishermen, food producers, ancillary industry workers and consumers, one that would be fair and reflect the level of resources EU nations had at their disposal.  I had hoped this set of proposals would amount to more than a fine-tuning of what was already in place, but it is not.  It is a tinkering at the edges and a barely concealed attempt by the Commission to take from those who are barely surviving in the fishing industry and put the money into the hands of the conglomerates.  I am delighted to hear that the Minister will, on behalf of the people, resist and oppose compulsory privatisation, which is what it is.  We will support him in his opposition to this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1847">I am new here and do not know how things work.  Were any Irish Ministers, officials or agencies negotiating with the Commission before it came up with these draft proposals?</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Colreavy</from>
          <p eId="para_1849">I find it difficult to understand, if there was an Irish input, why it was not listened to.  Is no one listening to what we are saying on behalf of the people?   Surely anybody who represents them would have come back with something much more substantial than what is contained in this document.  It is not the radical new era the country and its fishermen need or the one that will ensure the achievement of the ambitious but very necessary targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.  Unless the whole Common Fisheries Policy environment changes, we cannot achieve the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020 or the changes outlined in the management of our harbours policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1850">This is a foundation industry on which so much can be built, but the European Union has to loosen the chains and take off the handcuffs.  It is tying us up and what it has come up with is nothing more than fiddling about the edges.  We need to get back in contact with the Commission.  It is not just a question of booting out what is wrong in these proposals but of saying to the Commission that what is needed is a total re-write of the design for a new era.  We must go back to the drawing board on the Common Fisheries Policy.  I would negotiate with the Commission on what was good, right and fair.  However, it must take into account the fact we have an invaluable natural resource which we must protect on behalf of the people.  We should never have sold it from day one and must now get it back.</p>
          <p eId="para_1851">The Commission's proposals in regard to the privatisation of quota — I deliberately and advisedly call it such — will further exacerbate the problem of fish stock depletion.  The radical reform needed is not evident, nor is the re-write needed, and there is no suggestion it will be done.  We should be looking at this issue on an island-wide basis, as well as a Twenty-six Counties basis.  We need to go back to the Commission and say this is not good enough, that we will not wear it and that it has to be changed.  We will support the Minister when he opposes the more obnoxious parts of the proposals put before us.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_830">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_1852">I thank the Minister for coming to the House and giving us an opportunity to speak on what I would like to see, namely, a renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy.  I first started fishing with my father when I was eight years old in 1960.  At the time I fished out of the port of Fenit.  At certain times of the year, from October to the end of February, the port was alive because there was an inshore oyster fishery which has not been affected to date by the European Union.  During the winter months there was the landing of herring and whitefish, while in the summer there was potting and so forth.  This provided a very substantial income for the area and surrounding towns, seasonal though it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_1853">I went fishing full-time in 1969-70.  I worked on trawlers and there was potting in the summer and fishing for oysters in the winter months.  We made a reasonable living.  In modern terms we had what I would consider very primitive boats, but while the work was hard, it was very rewarding as one was working with nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_1854">In 1972, in the lead-up to the referendum on EU entry, I campaigned day and night against it for two reasons: first, the erosion of our sovereignty and, second and crucially from a practical economic point of view, the situation of the farming and fishing industries, both of which were very badly served.  For the people involved, small farmers working on 12, 14, 18 or 20 acres of land, it was hard work, but it provided an income.  They are all gone now, anyone with less than 50 acres is practically gone.  Rural Ireland has been severely decimated through the loss of its population, particularly its young and vibrant members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1855">The worst affected of all has been the fishing sector which has been utterly destroyed.  Somebody mentioned the figure of 11,000 people currently involved in the fishing industry and associated industries.  However, we must consider the potential of the industry.  We are an island nation, with huge resources off our coast.  However, no thought was given to fishing and there was no vision shown by the politicians of the day.  At the time they were looking at the carrot being dangled by the European Union.  Effectively, we have given away one of our greatest resources as a result.  What was needed at the time was investment in the fishing fleet and, more importantly, onshore to complement existing resources.  Had that happened, it would have been absolutely huge but unfortunately, it did not.  Although Deputy McHugh suggested one should not dwell on the past, I believe we must learn from it, which is the reason I have brought it up.  Having looked back on it and when anticipating how things will develop from now on, I note the figure mentioned was 4% of the European catch and 16% of the waters.  In fact, the percentage is a lot less than 4% because of a number of vessels that work out of Ireland under a flag of convenience.</p>
          <p eId="para_1856">Ireland has now been presented with a deliberate policy to further reduce its fishing fleet, which reminds me of the decommissioning aspect of this issue.  I note that fleet decommissioning has taken place in the past 12 to 14 years, whereby carrots effectively were being thrown at people who had struggled to make a living all their lives to buy them out.  This resulted in the accumulation of quota that went to the bigger boats and consequently, the fleet of necessity became progressively smaller.</p>
          <p eId="para_1857">Another attempt now is being made by the Commissioner to influence matters regarding the quota, its management and its probable transfer into a form of privatisation.  This effectively will mean that Irish fishermen will not be able to compete.  This is the reason they depend on all Members, Government and Opposition alike, to put their shoulders to the wheel to stand against these efforts and to do everything in their power to try, as Deputy Colreavy stated, to ensure a fair quota system can be made available to Ireland.  Members must stand up for this and should consider the example of Iceland, which I note has been mentioned as a predator.  In recent years, that country developed another form of economy and neglected its fishing economy.  However, after they went broke and belly-up on foot of the collapse of their banking system, they returned to exploiting their natural fishing resources and are thriving.  This is because Iceland did not give up on a national industry.  They fought a war with the Brits over their waters.  They stood up against the might of the British navy to defend their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1858">While one cannot put back the clock, this State has given away what probably is the most lucrative resource available to the people of this island for a short-sighted vision.  Members must now look ahead and plan ahead and as much as possible of what remains of that resource must be taken back.  In respect of conservation, the depletion of stocks and discards, I fail to understand how thousands of tonnes of perfectly good fish can be thrown back into the water at a time when people ashore struggle to put bread on the table.  This does not make sense and I acknowledge the Minister shares my views in this regard.</p>

It is morally wrong to throw good food back into the water to satisfy a regulation under which one operates and this issue must be considered.</p>

They have taken from us and it is time they gave us justice.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_1868">I thank the Minister for providing this opportunity to have a debate on the Common Fisheries Policy and the Commission proposals that were published last week.  It has been interesting to listen to the debate and I note there has been much mention of how the fishing industry was sold out to look after the farmers or for various reasons or because we did not know what we were doing.  This is not the case, as what happened was that while Ireland was negotiating its accession to the EEC, as it then was, it changed the rules to make fishing the sole responsibility of the Commission before we joined.  They set out to steal our resources because they knew what we had and we did not.  Funnily enough, in correspondence I received from the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, Lord rest him, a number of years ago, he accepted that fact but stated in his letter that they did not treat us as badly again.  They did not treat us as badly again because they were not obliged to.  According to Deputy McHugh, they have taken €500 billion from the seas around our coast in the intervening period and have left us with the scraps.  One million tonnes of fish are taken from our waters every year out of which we take 170,000 tonnes.  Our boats are not allowed into the North Sea to fish as our so-called European partners exclude us from there, while keeping for themselves full access to the Irish west coast.  Unfortunately, Members must consider the past and the first thing they must do is to rid themselves of the myth that we sold out fishing for farming because we did not.  Fishing was stolen from us before we even got there.  Dr. FitzGerald's words to me were that had we wished to negotiate on fishing back in the late 1960s, there would have been no negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1869">Today, Members are discussing this document and proposal that comes from the Commission.  Unfortunately, Irish fishing will be finished if they continue to talk about the Common Fisheries Policy or continue to talk about trying to work within that system.  The Irish fishing industry and coastal communities will continue to die because the more we try to work the system, the more we are being screwed by it.  We are being screwed by our so-called partners.  It is a pity that in the past 35 or 40 years, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party when in government never adopted the attitude suggested by Deputy Ó Cuív.  However, I agree with his suggestion that whenever Mr. Sarkozy mentions corporation tax, we should mention cod, haddock, hake, mackerel and everything else back to him.  I believe that were we to do a deal with regard to corporation tax on that basis in which we secured a fair deal for our fishing, we would win and derive real benefits therefrom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1870">I wish the Minister all the best when negotiating on this issue in Europe although if Ireland negotiates on the basis of this document, it is finished before it even begins.  However, the Minister still must go and still must fight it.  I acknowledge this will not happen within the next six months or the next year or two but unless an Irish Government, with the support of all Members, can propose something different and begin a conversation with our so-called partners and unless Ireland begins to build alliances around Europe on the basis of looking beyond the Common Fisheries Policy and getting rid of it completely, we never will have coastal communities that realise their potential or the benefit they could bring to this country.  Unfortunately, the Common Fisheries Policy will be adopted and quotas will be privatised.  This will constitute the first step on the road towards privatising them on a European-wide basis, whereby everything can be sold off to the Spaniards and the French and the west coast will be closed down completely.  This is what will happen because no matter what anyone involved in fishing in Ireland may think, they will be unable to compete against the might and financial power of the companies in Europe which will be able to buy out our resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1871">There are some positive elements in this document in respect of discards, which is an issue that must be sorted out and the proposals contained therein may go some way towards doing this.  Moreover, the proposal to create a regional advisory council on aquaculture would be an interesting development and I look forward to this taking place.  Perhaps then we could be advised as to the reason a more strict regime is being imposed on Ireland than on the rest of Europe or perhaps it simply is the manner in which small countries are treated within Europe.  In his closing remarks, the Minister should outline what resisting and opposing entails in respect of the privatisation of quota, as well as what steps ultimately are open to Ireland.  In addition, the Minister and his departmental officials should begin considering something different.  It is a road on which to start and to move on and then we might see some real benefits.  I wish the Minister well with the negotiations.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_840">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_1872">I am not an expert on fishing by any means.  However, I know the fishing industry is facing a massive crisis and it has been brought to my attention whenever I go to the west and by those fishermen in Dún Laoghaire who are left.  It is a coastal town which used to have a thriving fishing industry.  All the fishermen say that EU fisheries policies have been a disaster for Ireland and this is visibly apparent.  The crisis seems to be intensifying very significantly over recent years, with more people being driven out of fishing while others are struggling to make a living in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1873">I do not doubt the Minister's bona fides in this matter.  There seems to be general agreement on the seriousness and tragedy of this situation.  It is a crime for an island country such as ours that the fishing industry is teetering on the brink of extinction.  It is even more of a crime that this is the case when so many people are unemployed and there is an accelerating depopulation of rural Ireland.  Jobs must be created and, as Deputy Ferris said, the sea is probably our greatest resource.  The sea defines us.  If this country does not have a fishing industry, we will have lost something of what we are as a people.  We are perilously close to losing what defines us.  The fishing industry has provided jobs in the past and could provide many more.</p>
          <p eId="para_1874">As much as I have criticised the Government in other arenas, I commend the jobs initiative on its focus on tourism.  Our attractiveness as a tourism destination would be damaged if fishing, which is one of the things which defines us, were made extinct as a result of the policies of the European Union.  It is obvious that this plan to privatise quotas can only benefit the big fishing interests, the big European states and the multinational companies.  They are responsible for the parlous state of the fish stocks.  It is really a case of the big fish eating the little fish in every sense and this policy will further accelerate that situation and sound the death knell for Irish fishing and the small-time fisherman.  The issue of discards is an obscenity by which perfectly good fish are thrown away.  Something needs to be done about this policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1875">If the figures given by the Minister are correct, that we only receive 15% of the fish from our own waters, we must say to the EU that this is unacceptable and that we will not put up with it.  What benefit is there in being part of a European Union that is plundering our resources in this way and which has brought us to this state?  This echoes the current economic crisis.  Our so-called partners are supposedly helping us but in fact they are burying us in the interests of big financial and corporate interests in Europe.  We must stand up to these people and we have to defend our fishing industry and small fishermen.  We should oppose this privatisation of fish quotas.  We must work together on an all-party basis to decide how to stand up to these big European interests who just regard our seas as something to be plundered at our expense.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_1876">I am not an expert on the fishing industry, even though I live beside the sea in County Wexford.  However, I have seldom seen such consensus on a subject in this House as there is on the fishing industry.  The Minister will have the support of everyone when he goes to Europe to try to get a fair deal.  I have no doubt it will be very difficult for him.  Mistakes have been made in the past.  However, I do not agree with the theory that we should not look back at the past, because those who do not study their history are destined to repeat the mistakes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1877">It will be a struggle to change the arrangement with the European Union.  Ireland has not had a fair deal in this regard.  We have not only lost out on an industry with significant financial potential but serious damage is being caused to communities.  This is a small island with a very long coastline for the size of the land mass.  I refer to the culture of the communities built around these little ports.  I live near Kilmore, Duncannon and Fethard-on-Sea.  Everyone in the surrounding areas has traditionally found work in the industry, either dealing with landing the fish or going out on the boats, but this has been dwindling over time.  The rules were changed, but not in the favour of these communities.  Not only is an industry being destroyed, a whole way of life is threatened all along our coastline and it should instead be treasured.</p>
          <p eId="para_1878">Getting the Europeans to start treating us fairly, accepting that things were not done for the best in the past and achieving a more equitable arrangement is challenging.  On the financial side, interest rates are slowly creeping up because the French, Germans and Dutch are wary of inflation, even though they know well that this is the last thing the countries on the periphery, such as Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy, need.  Despite this, central Europe does what suits itself and it is doing very nicely.  We are being forced to accept the policy that suits them.  This notion of Europe being a family with all of us in together, and the notion that the big guy will help the small guy was how the Union began, and this is what we thought would happen.  Sadly, it has not worked out that way.  It would be great if the powers in Europe could bring themselves to apply a greater degree of fairness and could begin to treat the small individual countries like Ireland in a more fair manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1879">Aside from the bad deal which Ireland has received, I note the wastage of fish in the discards policy, the practice of over-fishing and the fact that Europe must now import two thirds of its fish for consumption because there is such waste and the stocks have been killed through over-fishing which is being carried out to a ridiculous degree.  We are depleting the oceans.  It is like cutting down the forests in Brazil to make money on selling the wood, despite the fact that we are damaging the environment in a dramatic way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1880">It reminds me of a saying by a Cree native North American tribe that only when the last tree has died, the last river been poisoned and the last fish been caught will we realise we cannot eat money.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
          <p eId="para_1881">I will try to respond to that profound comment at the end.  As I have only five minutes, I wish to concentrate on the job at hand which is to get the best deal possible from the existing document on the table.  I agree with Deputy Pringle that the idea that we sold out fishing to get a good deal on farming is totally inaccurate.  Ireland's deal on farming is no better or worse than that of other European countries.  That is evidenced in our Common Agricultural Policy discussions at the moment.  We have looked at the countries that have traditionally done well out of the Common Agricultural Policy and the countries that have not done well.  Ireland is right on the average.  This idea that we got some great deal for farmers but sold fishing down the drain is wrong — the two are not connected.  It is true that we persuaded people to vote in favour of EEC membership on the basis of payments to farmers.  The historical discussions on fishing are just that, historical discussions.  However, I need to deal with the realities of political negotiation to get the best possible deal to ensure we have a fishing industry in five or ten years' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1882">Some of the commentary here has been inaccurate.  The Irish fishing industry is not dying on its feet.  Last year Irish fishing industry exports grew by 15%.  There are 2,095 boats in the Irish fishing fleet employing 5,000 people.  Some 175 processing companies employ almost 3,000 people and a further 1,500 people are employed in ancillary services to the fishing industry.  While we want to employ considerably more people than that, we have a good base from which to work.  We have had consolidation of fleet as the Irish fleet has grown in terms of the trawler size and efficiency of catch.  If we did not have that we would have many more boats.  We also had some extremely wealthy people in the Irish fishing industry, in the pelagic sector in particular where there are 23 boats.</p>

          <p eId="para_1886">However, we should consider the catch.  The capacity for catch is just as high now.  That said, I am not happy with the state of the industry.  We have the capacity to expand the fishing industry but we need to use the tools available to us to do that.  In recent weeks we have been trying to encourage the catch in Irish waters by non-Irish trawlers to be landed in Irish ports to be processed and graded here, which can add significant value to the processing sector in Ireland.  We are doing what we can to expand the industry and we will do the same with aquaculture which has great potential for growth and expansion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1887">However, the idea that Deputy Ó Cuív seems to suggest that we can go over to Europe and demand that we get back all our quota from other countries and expect other people to support us and vote for that is incredibly naïve.  Let us deal in reality here.  Ireland needs to continue to get the best possible deal we can on quota allocation and we will fight for that every December when quota allocation is on the table.  In the discussions on the Common Fisheries Policy we are talking about the strategic development of the European fishing industry of which Ireland is a part.  For what it is worth, the European Union does not regard Irish waters as Irish waters but as EU waters, which Ireland has a responsibility to monitor and control.  That is the political reality of what we are dealing with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1888">In discussing what is being proposed as fisheries policy up to 2022 we need to defend ourselves against proposals that will further undermine the Irish fishing industry.  The proposal on individual transferable quotas, or fishing concessions as the Commissioner likes to call them, should not become a reality.  We are not alone on that because yesterday the German and French Ministers spoke out against it.  We are already building an alliance of countries that have real concerns over the ITQ proposal.  Ireland has led that debate and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1889">Ireland is also leading the debate on the mackerel issue the Deputy raised.  We have successfully called for trade sanctions against Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  The Commission has reassured us that it will have proposals for a legal base to implement sanctions by the start of October.  What is happening to mackerel stocks at the moment is disgraceful, particularly in Faroese waters.  The ship Deputy McHugh mentioned is the <i>Lafayette</i>, a Peruvian-registered vessel, which is the largest floating fish-processing factory in the world.  It has come to Faroese waters because they do not have the capacity to process the volumes of mackerel they are catching at the moment.  So they are doing it at sea and bringing in mercenaries to do it.  That is what is happening to European mackerel stocks which in the past we shared with the Faroese, but their take was approximately 4% of overall quota.</p>
          <p eId="para_1890">We are doing a considerable amount about things over which we have some influence and control.  Ireland is taking the lead in the debate on the mackerel issue for good reason because of the impact it will have on our fishing fleet.  Mackerel is the most important stock to our fleet and is a €3 billion industry in the European Union and a big segment of that comes to Ireland.  We are acting in areas where we have influence and we can impact on decision making.  We will do that in negotiations on mackerel and will also try to do that to the best effect possible in the ongoing negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy.  We are in a position of some influence because everybody realises at this stage that the final agreement on the CFP will happen during the Irish Presidency in the first half of 2013, as will be the case in all likelihood for the CAP also.</p>
          <p eId="para_1891">I thank the Deputies for their frankness in contributing to the debate this evening.  I certainly got a strong message from them and that will impact on the Government's thinking.</p>

            <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</from>
            <p eId="para_1892">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  I will give a brief history on the landfill site at Kerdiffstown, County Kildare, close to which I live.  In January a large-scale fire on the site made national headlines.  The fire was associated with material that had been left lying to one side of the main landfill site.  There was also the potential for contamination from leachate from the site.  I looked at some of the analysis of the leachate and there was potential for it moving towards a tributary of the Liffey, which is upstream of the Leixlip treatment plant which supplies water to much of north Kildare and west Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1893">When the EPA eventually got control, it had to deal with a number of issues.  First was a serious issue in the locality with regard to the odours being emitted from the site.  The EPA has installed some gas extraction facilities and the gas is being flared off.  It is also monitoring water in the locality constantly to ensure the leachate is not spreading towards the tributary.  To date, the EPA has spent €2.9 million on this phase of the landfill's remediation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1894">Phase two of the process is the planning and design of the remediation and may involve requests for planning permission to develop cells to which material may be safely moved.  The third phase is the actual remediation, which may take up to five years and cost approximately €30 million.  From where will this money come?  The EPA is pursuing the companies that operated the landfill site.  As most of them are in liquidation or receivership, it is doubtful that the EPA will be successful in garnering money from them through the courts.  The EPA is also pursuing their directors as individuals, but one would not be too optimistic about securing funding in this way either.</p>
            <p eId="para_1895">I am delighted the Minister is present, as I wish to ask him about another source of funding, namely, the Environment Fund, which was set up under the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001 and was to be used for activities that were of benefit to the environment.  The use of this fund for the site's remediation would be of benefit to the environment, given the constant odour problem and the potential of leachate entering a tributary of the Liffey.</p>
            <p eId="para_1896">Since the remediation's approximate cost will be €30 million, one may well ask whether there would be sufficient money in the Environment Fund.  As of 2010, the fund generated €60 million.  By 30 June this year, it had generated €30 million, a level consistent with its returns during the past three years.  Based on the 2009 figures, it has a surplus of approximately €40 million.  I presume the Comptroller and Auditor General's figures, when published, will also show a surplus for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1897">While I understand the works could last for up to five years, will the Minister set aside money from the Environment Fund to remediate this landfill?  If we do not remediate now, it could become problem.  Remediating it over five years would be cheaper than sitting by in the belief that we had done a good job for the time being and waiting eight to ten years for the economy to pick up and for us to have money, since by that time we could have a more expensive environmental disaster to remediate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1898">Will the Minister ring-fence some of the Environment Fund's surplus to secure and remediate this site so that it can either be brought into public ownership or a charge can be put on the land, through which its owners would be required to pay something towards the site's remediation?  If he does, we will have cleaned up an environmental hazard in the locality of Naas.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1899">I thank Deputy Lawlor for raising what is an important matter for his community and for providing me with an opportunity to update the House on the substantial effort being made by the relevant agencies, with financial support from my Department, to address the issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1900">As the Deputy indicated, substantial funding has already been provided from the Environment Fund to deal with the situation at the landfill at Kerdiffstown, County Kildare.  Some €2.26 million has been made available to support the work of Kildare County Council and the EPA in dealing with the fire that arose at the facility and in the follow-up work to address the longer-term issues arising.  I am committed to providing funding for additional expenditure to be incurred by the EPA in the period to the end of 2011 in respect of the agency's ongoing work at Kerdiffstown.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901">While further significant expenditure will arise beyond that, it is not possible to quantify precisely at this time, as the costs involved will depend on a range of factors, including the quantities of waste, the approach to remediation required and the results of tendering processes.  The levels of future funding available through the Environment Fund to fund specific projects and programmes will depend on the revenues accruing to the fund from the landfill and plastic bag levies and the range of competing demands seeking to draw from it.  Against this uncertain background, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give an absolute guarantee on ring-fencing further funding for works at Kerdiffstown in the years ahead, but I assure him that dealing with legacy issues at Kerdiffstown is a priority for me and will remain so when it comes to making future decisions on activities to be funded from the Environment Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">The current situation at Kerdiffstown is that, following the completion of the fire-fighting activity on 25 February 2011, the day the Deputy was elected, the fire services passed control of the site to the EPA.  The agency is using powers under the Waste Management Acts to remediate the site and to put in place appropriate after care measures.  I understand that the next major remedial works to occur on site will be the demolition of a number of unsafe buildings.  These are scheduled to be demolished in August and I understand that the EPA, as part of its communications programme regarding the site, will be outlining the specific dates before the works commence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">In general, remedial works are continuing at the site as part of a process that will take a few years.  Apart from the demolition works to which I have just referred, the next phase of activity involves a detailed site investigation, which is being advanced and prioritised to end of this year, followed by detailed design of the full remediation works programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1904">The EPA has also established a community liaison group comprising the agency, local residents, including members of the Clean Air for Naas group, business representatives and Kildare County Council.  The first meeting of the group was held earlier this month and included a site visit for group members and elected representatives from the area.  A range of relevant information is available on the dedicated project website established by the EPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1905">I am conscious of the significant environmental damage caused by the reckless and irresponsible management of the Kerdiffstown site by the company.  Deputy Lawlor can be assured that the site remediation will proceed as quickly as possible, but I cannot give the undertakings he has requested, as 200 legacy landfill sites in conditions that are almost identical to those at Kerdiffstown are also in need of remediation.  I am sorry that I have inherited so many sites that require this level of remediation and improvement in the interests of their communities and the environment, but I will do everything I can to assist the Deputy and the Kerdiffstown community as soon as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_849">
            <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_1906">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for granting me leave to raise this Adjournment matter.  In particular, I thank the Minister for taking this debate, which I have raised so that I might ask him to amend the Litter Pollution Act 1997 to ensure that local authorities are better equipped to combat the growing problem of illegal dumping.  Local authorities can only take action if the illegal dumping is somewhere it can be viewed by the public.  The specific language of the Act states that it is illegal for a person to create litter in a public place or in any place that is visible to any extent from a public place.  This means that, if people are gathering rubbish in their back garden and it cannot be seen from the road outside their house, the local authority is prohibited from taking an action against that household.</p>
            <p eId="para_1907">While the phrase's original intention was to empower local authorities to enforce litter pollution laws on private lands that are visible from public places, it has had the unintended effect of facilitating illegal dumping that remains hidden from the public eye.  Furthermore, the legislation's wording ignores the fact that a number of other senses are offended by the blight, for example, smells, the sounds of rodents and other nuisances associated with the accumulation of rubbish.  This is a serious problem, particularly in areas in which vacant properties have been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair and have become magnets for dumping.  Litter wardens should not be prevented from taking action in such cases simply because the waste cannot be seen from a public place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1908">Where student accommodation is concerned, a landlord is not required to have a waste collection agreement in place.  If students move in and do not put a waste collection system in place, their rubbish accumulates in the back garden or to the side of the house.  Since it is not visible from the public road, the area's residents must live with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1909">I urge the Minister to make the necessary legislative changes so that local authorities are in a stronger position to combat illegal dumping on private property regardless of whether the rubbish can be seen from public places.  This is a serious, yet resolvable problem and I look forward to the Minister's response on how he will address it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_1910">I thank Deputy Lynch for raising the issue of litter pollution, a matter in which I also have a very keen interest.  The Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 provide the statutory framework to combat litter effectively.  Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering must come from the local authorities.  The role of my Department is to provide the legislative framework and, within the prevailing funding constraints, to provide some limited financial support to local authorities for their enforcement efforts.  As independent statutory bodies with democratically elected councils and their own management system, it is a matter for each local authority to determine the most appropriate course of action, within the legislation provided, to tackle issues of this nature in their own local areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1911">Regarding litter on private property, under section 6 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997, it is an offence to allow the build-up of litter on a property that is visible from a public place.  Furthermore, if it considers that precautionary measures are required to prevent the creation of litter in its functional area, a local authority may, under section 9 of the Litter Pollution Act, serve a notice on the person concerned requiring the removal of the litter to which the contravention relates or take such other precautionary measures specified in the notice as the local authority considers necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1912">While I am aware of the difficulties that can be caused by the accumulation out of sight of the public of large quantities of litter, an amendment such as that suggested may be deemed unconstitutional as, in the absence of a visible litter problem justifying an intervention, it may be viewed as infringing on a citizen's right to privacy.  There are, however, other means to address the issue where it manifests itself in problems other than visible litter.  The build-up of significant levels of refuse in the manner outlined by the Deputy would most likely lead to vermin problems.  Under the Rats and Mice Destruction Act 1919 — and this is a new one for me — rodent control is the responsibility of the occupier of a premises.</p>

            <p eId="para_1914">Given the public health issues involved, enforcement of the legislation falls to the Health Service Executive.  Furthermore, where problems of this nature occur in local authority accommodation, the local authority, in its capacity as landlord, has a responsibility to ensure the property is being maintained in a reasonable condition and does not constitute a health risk.  The landlord may in this case insist on making an inspection of the property and ensuring that whatever remedial action is required to deal with the issue is taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">I am carrying out a review of waste and litter policy and one of the aspects I will be considering is the adequacy of litter fines and litter legislation generally.  While it is unlikely that, for the privacy related issues I have indicated, I will be able to amend the Litter Pollution Act to encompass areas that are not in public view, I will certainly consider the matter raised by the Deputy in the context of that review.</p>

          <heading>Mental Health Services</heading>
          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_853">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_1916">Let me first commend Deputy Kathleen Lynch on her new role as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and on her efforts to progress services and facilities for citizens with mental health needs.  I am glad to have the opportunity to bring the critical issue of mental health services in the north Dublin area to the Minister's attention.  Under the direction of the Mental Health Commission, the male and female acute units in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, are set to close on 31 August when the hospital's licence is withdrawn.  These critical services are supposed to be replaced by a new acute unit at Beaumont Hospital.  Of course, I accept the bona fides of the Mental Health Commission's decision that the acute facilities at St. Ita's are massively sub-standard and hugely outdated.  There has been a long campaign to phase out the hospital.  There are, however, profound concerns about what will happen to citizens with acute psychiatric hospital needs when the St. Ita's acute units close at the end of August.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">While generally aware of the closure, I was shocked to see a couple of weeks ago in Dublin City Council's planning list for week 25 the planning application for the Beaumont unit only being granted now.  Many people thought that this unit was close to completion or had been already built.  Development is proposed for two sites on the Beaumont grounds, immediately to the east of the existing multi-storey car park and to the north of the Irish Kidney Association building.  The site near the multi-storey car park is to consist of a new two-storey structure with a number of internal courtyards housing an acute psychiatric residential facility and old age psychiatric residential facility.  According to the Minister for Health, the contract has been awarded for the new acute admissions unit at Beaumont and construction on the unit will not start at the end of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">In a reply to a question submitted by Deputy Ó Caoláin on 14 July, the Minister for Health reported that there was an interim plan to refurbish part of the existing buildings at St. Ita's until the new Beaumont unit was ready.  Incredibly, however, the Minister also reported on the same date just last week that: "Refurbishment work has not yet been undertaken and I understand that the HSE is in discussions with the Commission with a view to agreeing alternative arrangements for patients."</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">I hope the Minister present will be able to comprehensively report on the outcome of those discussions.  It is shockingly close to the closure deadline and many patients and their families are very worried because they are completely in the dark about what will happen after 31 August.  For example, it is rumoured in Fingal that Fingal patients will have to be accommodated at locations like Ardee, County Louth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">There is also a serious crisis in the provision of mental health services for adolescents in the north Dublin region, and a number of staff working in the area are regularly in touch with me on this matter.  Since the recommendation by the Mental Health Commission of a ban on the admission of adolescents into adult wards, there has been an ongoing crisis in the provision of appropriate assessments or inpatient admissions when necessary for 16 and 17 year olds.  There are just six beds in the adolescent unit in St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview for the huge catchment area of the northside of Dublin and they are always full.  Local clinicians report that this is an excellent unit that tries to free up beds as quickly as possible.  But with only six beds available it is very difficult to find a bed if a young person is in extreme crisis in an accident and emergency room or a GP's surgery.  Private hospitals such as St. John of God's or St. Patrick's do not accept emergency admissions over the weekend so an adolescent must spend the whole weekend in an accident and emergency department waiting for admission if a crisis occurs at the weekend.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">Incredibly, staff have reported that they have been directed to seek adolescent beds in Cork or Galway if the Fairview unit is full.  Understandably, local clinicians believe the proposed transfer of an adolescent in a crisis or suicidal situation to a bed hundreds of miles across the country in Cork or Galway is not an appropriate or practical response.  I understand that staff also believe that HSE management have not been properly engaged on this matter and there have been ongoing issues about getting senior HSE managers to attend critical meetings with local clinicians and mental health service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">Why can 16 and 17 year olds who need access to mental health services not be seen by child and young adolescent services rather than adult psychiatry services?  In the Mater Hospital and Temple Street hospital there are 24-hour on-call services for children and adolescents up to the age of 15 for emergency assessments which 16 and 17 year olds cannot access.  Incidentally, why is there not a similar 24-hour service available at Beaumont?  In the longer term, local clinicians have suggested the creation of youth mental health teams which could be manned by both child and adult psychiatrists and psychologists and nurses.  These teams could deal with young people between 15 and 25.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">On St. Ita's and youth mental health service provision, the key problem is that the Mental Health Commission has rightly made decisions on the unsuitability of current mental health facilities or practices.  Adequate interim measures and resources have simply not been put in place and are causing extreme distress for citizens who need to access mental health services.  What reassurances can the Minister now provide to patients and staff across the north Dublin region that the profound deficit in mental health services in our region will be urgently addressed?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_854" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_1924">I will be taking this matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and I thank Deputy Broughan for raising it as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House on the current position in the development of mental health services in north Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1925">The Mental Health Commission has attached a condition to the registration of St. Ita's Hospital which requires the closure of the existing male and female acute units by 31 August.  Officials and clinicians from north Dublin mental health services had meetings with the commission regarding requirements to address this condition, and a plan involving the refurbishment of part of an existing building at the hospital was developed as an interim solution pending the completion of the proposed new acute psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital.  The refurbishment work has not yet been undertaken and I understand the HSE is in discussions with the commission with a view to agreeing alternative arrangements for patients.  The HSE has, however, assured the Minister that access to appropriate acute mental health services will continue to be provided for the people of north Dublin beyond 31 August 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">With regard to the new acute psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital, the position is that the contract has been awarded and an application for planning permission has been submitted.  The Minister is hopeful that construction will commence in the last quarter of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">Traditionally adult mental health services were responsible for the 16 to 17 year old age group and admissions to approved centres in that age group were to adult facilities.  However, the Mental Health Act 2001 amended the definition of a child to include 16 and 17 year olds, and A Vision for Change subsequently recommended that the child and adolescent mental health service should provide services to all children up to the age of 18 years.  Thus, in the context of the implementation of A Vision for Change, the HSE is required to reconfigure resources and to remodel psychiatric services to ensure 16 and 17 year olds are treated by the child and adolescent service.  Currently, transitional arrangements apply for services for children in this age group, as resources are redirected from the adult service to the child and adolescent service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1928">At present, the community adult mental health services in HSE North Dublin provide out-patient services to 16 and 17 year olds, while the Mater child and adolescent mental health services provide the service for young persons up to 16.  This arrangement will continue until the services provided by the Mater are developed in line with A Vision for Change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1929">There are currently 61 child and adolescent mental health teams nationally, of which 56 are community based.  Further teams will be developed in line with the recommendations of A Vision for Change and in this regard I would like to draw the attention of the House to the commitment in the programme for Government to ringfence €35 million annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services to ensure early access to more appropriate services both for adults and children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">Inpatient psychiatric services for adolescents in north Dublin are provided at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview and at Warrenstown for children up to 16 years.  I am pleased to say that work is due to commence later this year on the second phase of the child and adolescent unit at Fairview, which will increase capacity from six to 12 beds.  It is also proposed to provide an eight-bed interim facility in St. Loman's, Palmerstown, pending the proposed development of a purpose built 22-bed child and adolescent unit in Cherry Orchard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1931">I again thank Deputy Broughan for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to allay any concerns regarding the provision of mental health services in north Dublin.  The House can be assured of the ongoing commitment of this Government to the development of mental health services in line with A Vision for Change.</p>

          <heading>Medical Cards</heading>
          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_855">
            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_1932">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing this matter to be debated on the Adjournment.   I also thank the Minister for being present.  It is good to see a Minister here at this hour of the night.  He is very welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_1933">I have tabled this matter to request the Minister to deal urgently with a situation that has been brought to my attention recently by a number of constituents.  They have been refused medical cards for the bizarre reason that they earn too little and fall below a minimum income limit, rather than exceeding it.  Not many people would believe that such an irrational situation applies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">This ruling is being applied to self-employed people, mature students on grants and people who have found for various reasons that they are not entitled to social welfare payments.  To illustrate the case, I would draw the Minister's attention to two cases.  First, a mature student who is a constituent of mine graduated recently from college with a first class degree.  She was encouraged by the college to continue by doing a  Masters degree and then a PhD programme, due to her brilliance.  She was hopeful of starting the Masters programme but was informed that the mature student's grant has been cut from over €6,100 to just €2,300 because from this year mature students do not have automatic entitlement to what is called the "non-adjacent rate".  That excludes people living in Dublin and surrounding areas, including university towns and campuses.  Of course, as mature students are not living with their parents they are not dependants either.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">The mature student grant was equivalent to the supplementary welfare rate and so she had retained her entitlement to a medical card during her three undergraduate years.  Now that the maintenance grant has fallen below the supplementary welfare rate, she has been informed that if she accepts the place in college on the reduced maintenance grant, she will lose her medical card.  This is bureaucracy gone mad.  If she refuses the college place and turns her back on the postgraduate studies, she will most likely be unemployed and will be in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance.  However, and this is the catch — or the benefit — she will then be entitled to a medical card.  After being six months unemployed on the jobseeker's allowance, she will be able to avail of the back to education allowance.  When she is on the latter allowance, she will have full social welfare, the maintenance grant — albeit the non-adjacent one, which is lower — and the medical card.  Of course, it will be far more expensive on the State but it will occur six months later, the course will not start for 12 months, so she will have lost a year's studies.  The situation is disadvantageous for everybody in those circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">This first-class honours graduate has an opportunity to progress through education and greatly enhance her employment prospects and her contribution to the State, but is now effectively being excluded from the education system.  The cut in her grant means that she is being discriminated against because she is already living in Dublin.  A mature student from the country could move to Dublin to study and be entitled to the full grant.  That is how anomalous the situation is.</p>
            <p eId="para_1937">The second case is of another constituent who is earning just €72 per week.  He has worked since he was 15 years of age and claimed unemployment assistance for just three weeks in his entire life.  He is now being told that he earns too little to be considered for a medical card as he is not, and I quote, "financially independent, with means that are within the medical card-GP-visit card guidelines.  For a person to be considered financially independent, s-he must be in receipt of income equivalent to, or greater than, the current standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance".  So it must be at least at the supplementary welfare allowance rate of €186, or greater.  Unfortunately, the poor man is below, not above, the threshold so he does not qualify.  It is ludicrous.</p>
            <p eId="para_1938">Apparently, the presumption is — I do not know whether there is any truth in this, but I have heard it — that anybody earning less than the social welfare allowance of €186 could not possibly survive on that and must be abusing the system.  The system will therefore not accept their application on those grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">The preservation of our citizens' health and wellbeing must be a priority for the State.  It is imperative that the operation of the medical card scheme is carried out fairly and that those most in need of health care have recourse to seeking proper medical care.  The Minister should review the scheme to ensure that bureaucratic guidelines do not prevent people who are most in need of medical cards from receiving them.  I call on the Minister to reverse this anomaly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1942">I am interested in the examples cited by the Deputy, but I cannot give him a solution because I am not the appropriate Minister to give the discretionary information he requires.  Deputy Costello has put forward an interesting number of examples which give rise to concern about the manner in which these matters are being investigated and assessed by the HSE.  Applicants whose weekly incomes are solely derived from social welfare or HSE payments, even where the amounts are in excess of the HSE income guidelines, are granted a medical card, either a first application or a renewal.  While income guidelines are the principal benchmark used for deciding medical card eligibility, the HSE does look beyond the applicant's financial situation and has regard to other matters that it considers appropriate in assessing a person for a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1943">Rather than giving the Deputy the standard reply I have before me, I will ask the Deputy to furnish me with the examples he has cited this evening, including correspondence.

A total of 8,171 applications were registered in the first 6 months of 2011 and 6,702 were processed in the same period.  There are currently 5,294 applications awaiting a decision. There are 51,134 carer's allowance claims in payment. There are approximately 100 carer's allowance applications on hand where the applicant has supplied additional information and requested a review of a refusal by a deciding officer.  I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that there are currently 2,300 carer's allowance cases awaiting a decision on appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1949">I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate steps to resolve the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">In particular, a major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme. This involves the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  Accordingly, this project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department, which has had, however, a short-term negative impact on claim processing times.  The first tranche of new carer's allowance claims will begin to be processed under the new system in August 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">While these new systems and processes will facilitate a significant improvement in overall processing times it should be noted that individual claims may still take some time to process. Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if people applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_1952">I am assured that the situation is being monitored closely by the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1955">I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 154 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1956">One of the core commitments in the Programme for Government is the restoration of fiscal stability. As we all know, overall Government spending in 2011 will be roughly €18 billion more than this year's overall Government income and that level of Exchequer borrowing is clearly not sustainable. In round terms, the total income that Government will get from tax and PRSI in 2011 is €42 billion. My Department is expected to spend over €20 billion or almost half of tax and PRSI income combined. For that reason, the transition to a more balanced budgetary position simply cannot be made without affecting social welfare spending. The funding agreement with the EU and IMF commits the Government to a further adjustment of "<i>at least €3.6 bn</i>” in Budget 2012, including a reduction in expenditure of €2.1 billion. The Department of Social Protection necessarily has a major contribution to make in achieving a more balanced budget, as it accounts for 39% of gross current voted expenditure, equivalent to 16% of GNP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1957">The depth of the economic downturn and the size of the exchequer borrowing requirement are such that there will be an on-going necessity to curtail overall expenditure in 2012 and in later years.  The exact level of contribution that spending on social welfare will make to the overall reduction in expenditure will be decided by Government later this year, informed by the outcome of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure that is currently underway in all Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">The objectives of the Review are to inform the best use of resources which will enable us to meet overall fiscal consolidation targets, re-align spending with Programme for Government priorities, target resources at the most effective programmes  and set new objectives.  This is necessary for many reasons, not least so that we can continue to make social welfare payments at appropriate levels, sustaining social cohesion and treating people with dignity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">I have also established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare which harnesses expert opinion and experience to address a number of specific issues around the operation and interaction of the tax and social protection systems.  They will recommend cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved and identify the specific practical institutional and administrative improvements to their operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">Any changes to the schemes and services provided by my department, including the levels of welfare payments, will be informed by the overall Government-wide options identified in the comprehensive review and by the findings of the Advisory Group</p>

            <p eId="para_1962">The Department engages consultants (individuals or organisations) to provide intellectual or knowledge based services (e.g. expert analysis and advice) including the delivery of reports, studies, assessments, recommendations and proposals that contribute to decision making or policy making.  As part of a drawdown contract on business processing, consultants have been commissioned to build on the work completed by the Department in the development of the National Employment and Entitlements Service. The cost of this project is €135,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">The Social Inclusion Division of my Department has commissioned research on poverty trends through a three year contract at a per annum cost of €80,000. The researchers produce an annual report on poverty trends and technical reports and contributes to research seminars and briefings. The 2011 annual report is on childhood deprivation and poverty and the technical paper is on poverty measurement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1964">Funding is also provided for the Social Inclusion Research Innovation Awards (SIRIA), which is managed on behalf of the division by the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) as part of its <i>Research Development Initiative 2010</i>  . The total grant aid is €110,000, paid in two instalments in 2010 and 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">In addition to work commissioned by the Social Inclusion Division, the Department also commissioned, as part of a multi-annual programme, a range of research projects in pensions modelling and child income support. The allocation for this work in 2011 is €150,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1966">The Department has contracted with a specialist Information Systems (IS) Internal Audit provider for a three year programme, commencing July 2011, to carry out internal audits on the Departments ICT systems.  This is to provide independent assurance that internal controls and security are satisfactory in the IS area.  The cost will be between and €29,040 and €54,450 per annum over the three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">The Department has engaged assistance in developing and implementing information security standards and promoting best practice throughout the Department.  The programme of work includes the provision of advice and support on a range of issues, including Identity and Access Management, Data Classification and Retention, Risk Assessment of critical IS systems and infrastructure and an Information Security and Data Protection awareness programme. €60,000 is allocated to this work in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">This year €3,557 has also been spent to provide a practitioner's view of access requirements to General Registry Office (GRO) historical records for genealogical research.</p>

            <p eId="para_1971">I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 41 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">The Government is committed to pursuing the deficit reduction strategy in a way that is fair, balanced, and which recognises the need for social solidarity. Sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for future economic stability and growth, and for maintaining and developing our social protection system. In that regard, the Government believes it is appropriate, in order to enhance international credibility, to stick to the aggregate adjustment as set out in the National Recovery Plan for the combined period 2011- 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department will be considered in the context of Budget 2012 and subsequent Budgets. This consideration will be informed by the commitment in the Programme for Government to maintain social welfare rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">The economic situation is such that there will be an ongoing requirement to curtail expenditure in 2012 and in later years. This is necessary for many reasons, not least so that we can continue to make social welfare payments at appropriate levels, sustaining social cohesion and treating people with dignity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1975">The priority of this Government is to get our economy moving, restore confidence, fix our banking system and support the protection and creation of jobs. The Jobs Initiative is the first step in our recovery strategy and includes a number of initiatives which will be administered by my Department including the recently introduced Internship Scheme JobBridge.  In addition, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011, provided for the halving of the lower rate of employer PRSI thereby making it cheaper for employers both to take on and retain workers and thereby reduce unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1976">There are considerable challenges ahead including the need to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by my Department. This process will be informed by the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which will be completed over the summer. The findings of the Review will then be available to the Government and will feed into its discussions on possible changes to schemes and services generally. The key decisions in this area will be made in the context of framing the Budget for 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1980">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1981">There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country, with national support provided by the MABS NDL.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at <i>www.mabs.ie</i>.  Some 90% of clients presenting to MABS are assisted through the telephone helpline, which provides assisted self-help to ensure clients take steps to assess and address their situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">Responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) transferred to the Citizens Information Board (CIB) in 2009 to provide strong management support to the local voluntary MABS companies.  As part of the ongoing review of its services the Board have put a new organisational structure in place, since April 2011, which enables CIB regional managers to get a greater insight into the nature of supports required by MABS companies on the ground to deliver an effective service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1983">The CIB recently submitted a position paper setting out options for the future shape of MABS taking into consideration commitments in the Programme for Government and recommendations contained in the final reports of the Law Reform Commission on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement, and the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.  This paper is currently under consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1984">In addition, The Citizens Information Board and the Department are also engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality concerning their plans for reform of personal insolvency law, and the role of MABS, in the context of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1985">I am satisfied that MABS will continue to provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1988">I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 192 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">The staffing needs of my Department are kept under constant review to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources. In the context of the Employment Control Framework targets, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department will continue to source available staff by way of transfer and redeployment from within the Department and from other Government Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1990">Arising from the economic downturn, in excess of 900 staff have been assigned to my Department, in the period since May 2008, to fill critical vacancies and additional posts that were approved to deal with the significant increase in claims for the various schemes operated by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1991">It is recognised that the provision of additional staff in itself is not the only appropriate way to deal with the increased demands for the schemes operated by the Department. In this regard, all scheme areas in the Department are subject to continuous business process improvement supported by modern technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1992">As the Deputy will be aware, one of the main impacts on current service delivery has been the increase in the Live Register.  In this context, the Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives regarding claims for jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit.  One of the most significant initiatives, aimed at reducing queuing and waiting times, involves customers attending their local office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1993">Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria.  For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes; medical examinations are required for some of the illness related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  In the case of the insurance-based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.</p>
            <p eId="para_1994">Process improvements have resulted in a significant reduction in the number and proportion of all claims awaiting a decision.  For example, there were 40,417 jobseeker's claims awaiting a decision on 9th July 2011 equating to 8% of the total claim-load. This compares favourably to 10th July 2010 when 52,542 claims or 10% of claim-load were awaiting decision and 82,520 claims or 17% of claim-load in July 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1995">As the Deputy is aware, it is planned to integrate the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive, and employment and other services from FÁS into my Department. When this process is completed it will provide the basis for a new model of service delivery in my Department. The aim will be to ensure that income and employment support services are delivered in an effective and more timely case management based approach.</p>

            <p eId="para_1997">Creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that we face.  It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues and ensure that work is worthwhile.  To this end, I recently set up an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare. The first meeting of the Group took place on 30 June and I understand that the Group is considering its work programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1998">The main rationale for setting up the Group is to harness expert opinion and experience to address a number of specific issues around the operation and interaction of the tax and social protection systems. The Group will also be tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better outcomes achieved, particularly child outcomes, and with identifying the specific practical institutional and administrative improvements to their operation. The Group will initially prioritise the area of family and child income supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1999">It is envisaged that the Group's work programme will be based, where possible, on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference in line with a timetable agreed by myself, in consultation with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget/estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support.</p>
            <p eId="para_2000">The Advisory Group is currently developing its mode of working and I expect that decisions in respect of publishing recommendations will be made at the appropriate time. It should be noted that the Group's recommendations will be considered in the first instance by a steering committee consisting of myself and the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and others, as considered necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_2003">The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore and access, under professional guidance, a full range of employment and training services.  Development of the NEAP is central to ongoing development in the labour market policy area and will be progressed within the framework of a new National Employment and Entitlements Service which, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is being established by the Department.  The new service will integrate employment and benefit payment services, currently delivered by FÁS and the Department, respectively,  within the Department and will be based on a case management approach with the objective of providing a more customised and personal service to customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">In line with good international practice, this new service will focus primarily on activation. The objective is to encourage and enable customers to embark on developmental pathways appropriate to their needs; pathways to employment and /or training and/or personal development.  The objective of the new service is to offer users a high level, personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.  A key feature of the new service will be that customers will be expected to engage with these options in order to retain their entitlement to full benefit payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2005">A number of pilot projects are ongoing in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs.   These pilot projects will evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their roll out nationwide as part of the national employment and entitlements service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2006">These developments are complimented by measures announced recently by the Government under the Jobs Initiative and include initiatives such as JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme, which will provide 5,000 internship opportunities of 6 or 9 months in organisations in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors. Participants will retain their social welfare entitlements and will also receive a ‘top-up' of €50 per week.  In addition, from July 2, the rate of employers PRSI on jobs paying up to €356 per week has been halved to 4.25%, up to end 2013.  All of the measures outlined above will support people who are unemployed in acquiring the education and skills and work experience that will assist them in returning to employment while measures such as the PRSI reduction will encourage employers to new employment.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2040">I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 43, 44, 46 and 48 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2041">I have no plans to reconsider the changes to the fuel allowance and household benefits package which were announced last week.  From September 2011 the fuel allowance is to be standardised at €20 per week, the rate currently received by the majority of customers, with no additional allowance for living in a smokeless area.  The cost of the telephone allowance will be reduced following negotiations with Eircom which will ensure that customers receive €26.86 of value on their bills, at a cost to the State of €22.22 per month.  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance will be reduced to the level at the start of 2007 (from 2,400 to 1,800).  It should be noted that the unemployed do not receive these benefits apart from the long-term unemployed who may receive a fuel allowance. These three measures will generate savings of €17 million in 2011 and €65 million annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">While we have had to implement these measures, the House should be aware that these savings were provided for last December in Budget 2011 but were not specified or announced by the then Government at that time.  On the specific measures, the rationale for paying the smokeless allowance to customers in smokeless areas is no longer valid.  The price differential between the types of coal is as low as 2% while the allowance represents an addition of 20% to the Fuel Allowance.  Use of coal has dropped considerably, to about 3%.  It is inequitable to continue paying this top-up allowance when it is not required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2043">As regards the telephone allowance, the deal negotiated with Eircom represents good value for the State and the customer.  The main saving is that the Department will no longer pay a monthly rental for handsets, but customers will be able to keep their set at no charge.  Indeed, a lot of households no longer use or have their original handsets so it makes no sense that the State would continue to pick up this cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_2044">The reduction in units in the electricity allowance and equivalent gas allowance is essential to control spending.  Because the allowances are based on units the full cost of energy increases has been borne by the State, with no incentive for customers to switch to other cheaper companies.  Only 16% of social welfare customers have switched companies compared to 42% nationally.  People will be able to offset some of the reduction in units by availing of cheaper rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2045">As regards the commitment to putting the household benefits out to tender, I am still exploring this issue. However, the Chief State Solicitor's Office has advised that the Department does not have the right to go to the market to procure electricity as it is not actually the customer in the first instance.  This view has been endorsed by the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Competition Authority.  I am indeed anxious to get the best value possible from the utility companies and the deal concluded with Eircom is a positive response in this regard.  We are in negotiations with other suppliers also and I am hopeful that having regard to the difficult budgetary situation that we find ourselves in that they will respond positively too given their social responsibilities.  We also have initiated contacts with smaller providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2046">While of course we want to protect the basic social welfare payments which have very positive economic and social effects, regrettably there is an ongoing necessity to achieve savings due to our commitments with the IMF/EU/ECB Troika.  There will be an ongoing necessity to curtail overall expenditure in 2012 and in later years.  The Comprehensive Review of Expenditure currently under way in all government departments and agencies will form the basis for making the necessary decisions to achieve this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">A poverty impact assessment was carried out on a range of options for the future administration of the household benefits package. This focused on the potential impact of changing the electricity allowance from a unit base to a cash base to avail of cheaper rates available.  The assessment concluded that the proposal would have limited impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">Along with other Departments and agencies, my Department has been working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on an Affordable Energy Strategy and this is expected to be brought to Government in the Autumn.  Energy poverty is a factor of income, energy prices and the thermal efficiency of the home. The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to reduce their consumption of energy through improving the thermal efficiency of the home.  Sustainable Energy Ireland has administered an energy efficiency programme for privately owned low income households (Warmer Homes) since 2001. Over 65,000 such households have benefited to date, with a further 15,000 expected to receive energy efficiency upgrades this year. A similar upgrade programme is also in place for local authority houses.</p>

            <p eId="para_2050">From 1 January 2011 policy and funding responsibility for FÁS functions in relation to employment and community services was transferred to my Department in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010. This is a transitional arrangement.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010 provides for the transfer of all employment and community services, including staff and other resources, from FÁS to the Department of Social Protection.  It is anticipated that this will be completed before the end of this year.  Since January my Department and FÁS have been working closely to ensure that the various HR and administrative systems, such as payroll records and IT systems are put in place for the full transfer of staff and services before the end of the year. An intensive IR process is also under way which is dealing with staff terms and conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2051">To facilitate reform and to speed up the integration process at local level, a number of joint planning workshops between FÁS, CWS and DSP staff and senior management have taken place.  Staff at local level have begun to implement integrated approaches to service provision following the  identification  by FÁS and DSP front line staff of actions and ‘quick wins'  that can be undertaken to support the integration process and deliver early results.  To accelerate the reform process, FÁS and the Department are working on a number of pilot projects in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs.   These pilot projects will be completed and evaluated after which approaches will be developed for their roll out nationwide as part of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2052">As part of such an approach, FÁS and the Department worked together on the development the new National Internship Scheme JobsBridge which was launched by the Taoiseach on 30th June 2011.  It is expected that this scheme will provide 5,000 internships of up to nine months duration and participants will retain their social welfare entitlements and will also receive a ‘top-up' of  €50 per week.</p>

            <p eId="para_2054">As the Deputy is aware, the administrative arrangements for the 2011 back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme are different from those that applied in previous years. In previous years these applications were manually processed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on behalf of the Department. For this year the majority of back to school clothing and footwear allowance entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2055">This year the automated process identified some 127,000 households and generated payments in respect of some 243,000 children.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is paid in respect of eligible children between the ages of:  — 2 and 17 years of age, and  — between the ages of 18 and 22, if in full time education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2056">In order to receive a payment on an automated basis the parent of the child must have been in receipt of a qualifying payment that included an increase in respect of a qualified child at the commencement of the scheme and also the household had to satisfy the means test for the scheme. The scheme commenced from the 1st June 2011 with the entitlement created based on the preceding week.  As part of this year's administrative arrangements the Department will carry out a full review of the process and identify any improvements for subsequent years. In addition, if the Department establishes that any person received a payment to which he/she was not entitled, it will seek to recover that amount in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_2059">A new Customer Charter and Customer Action Plan 2012-2014 will be drafted this year which will incorporate the changed role of the Department following recent Government decisions in relation to the Department's responsibilities and functions.  As part of this process a new set of customer service standards will be established.  Some 1.4m people each week receive a social welfare payment and when qualified adults and children are included, a total of over 2.1m people benefit from weekly payments. Some 600,000 families receive child benefit payments in respect of over 1.1m children each month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2060">The day-to-day activities of the Department include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2061">some 50 separate schemes and services;</p>
            <p eId="para_2062">over 2m applications cleared annually;</p>
            <p eId="para_2063">over 6.5m telephone calls to the Department annually;</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">over 85.3m payments annually;</p>
            <p eId="para_2065">processing applications for Personal Public Service Numbers for customers from some 140 countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">As part of its ongoing modernisation agenda, the Department delivers services to customers through  a range of contact channels — telephone, SMS text messaging, websites, online services and walk-in services.  This gives customers more choice in how they access services, and also provides a more integrated service. The Department has been proactive in implementing new processes and procedures to improve service delivery, for example, in its local office process modernisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">Any organisation experiencing peaks in demand for its service, as the Department has in recent years, may at times also experience periods where the service it provides may not always meet customer expectations.  Additional staff have been appointed to the Department in recent times to help meet this demand, particularly in respect of Jobseekers payments. However, it should be noted that the Department must also achieve the employment control framework (ECF) targets, as agreed under the Public Service Agreement 2010 -2014, through compliance with the moratorium on recruitment.  I am satisfied that my Department has the resources to meet the current demand for its services and will continue to deliver quality customer services to the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_2070">I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 51 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">The need for reform of the Joint Labour Committee system was clearly signalled in the Programme for Government.  Following the commissioning of an Independent Review of Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) and Registered Employment Agreement (REAs) Wage Setting Mechanisms, my colleague, Richard Bruton, T.D., Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation undertook a consultation process on the main issues arising from the report. The outcome of this work is currently under consideration by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2072">The Government will consider the impact of the reform proposals on workers with a view to achieving balanced reform which produces good outcomes for employment and social protection. My Department undertook an interim analysis of the broader impact of reform of EROs/REAs on low paid workers and the social protection system generally, and how reduced pay levels due to a reduction in Sunday premia and in overtime pay could possibly lead to an increased reliance on the social welfare system. This assessment will inform the Government's deliberations on the reform of EROs/REAs, with a view to achieving balanced reform for all those affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides a number of schemes to support low paid workers and to prevent in-work poverty, including Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit, One Parent Family Payment and Family Income Supplement. These schemes provide financial supports for workers who meet the eligibility requirements and who may be affected through a reduction in earnings by the recent High Court ruling in relation to EROs made by JLCs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2075">The Jobs Initiative recently announced by the Government contains additional labour market activation measures that aim to provide unemployed people with enhanced opportunities to maintain and develop their skills and competencies while also offering the possibility of securing valuable work experience.  These measures will assist those seeking employment to maintain their links with the labour market while also improving their prospects of securing employment.   The Jobs Initiative contains an additional 20,900 education, training and work experience places for the unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">A key element of that initiative was the introduction by my Department of the National Internship Scheme (NIS) last month which will provide 5,000 places for internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months in organisations in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors.  These opportunities will provide participants with valuable work experience that will develop their skills and enhance their career prospects. The national internship scheme was launched earlier in July.  In addition, from July 2, the rate of employers' PRSI on jobs paying up to €356 per week was halved to 4.25%, up to end 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">These measures and others announced as part of the jobs initiative, complement ongoing development in the labour market policy area.  The 5,000 NIS places, for example, are additional to the 5,000 places announced under the Tús community work placement initiative in last December's Budget.  My Department also operates a range of employment support measure designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  Supports available include the back to education allowance, the back to work schemes and the employer job PRSI incentive scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">The measures announced under the Jobs Initiative, together with ongoing and planned further development of a range of activation and employment support measures, will have a significant impact on the Live Register, particularly in so far as they prepare unemployed people for jobs that will be generated as the economy improves.</p>

            <p eId="para_2080">The legislative basis which provides for the introduction of the Partial Capacity scheme is contained in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2010, which was enacted by the Oireachtas in December 2010.   A programme of work is currently under way to cater for the new scheme. This includes the preparation of Regulations, as required by legislation, which will set out the rates of payment which will apply to those who avail of the scheme; and the finalisation of the medical criteria against which partial employment capacity will be assessed; and the development of the necessary processes and information technology systems to process, record and pay applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">Every effort is being made to complete these necessary steps to allow for the formal introduction of the scheme at the earliest possible date.  At this stage, I envisage that the Regulations will be introduced in the Autumn of this year and that the scheme will be formally introduced before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">The introduction of the Partial Capacity scheme will mark a key development of the social welfare system.  The scheme recognises that the current structure of the welfare system, which categorises people as ‘fit to work' or ‘unfit to work', does not reflect the reality for many existing customers.  It will provide an opportunity for people with disabilities, and assessed to have an employment capacity which is restricted, to avail of employment opportunities while continuing to receive an income support payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2085">The Department of Social Protection is responsible for maintaining the national database of Personal Public Service (PPS) numbers which are stored on the Department's Central Records System (CRS).  There are currently 7.4 million customer records on CRS each of which is identified by a unique PPS number.  The PPS number in its current format was originally a tax reference number.  With the introduction of Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) in 1979 an individual's Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax reference number became known as a Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number.  The RSI number was renamed the Personal Public Service (PPS) number in 1998 to reflect its future use as a unique identifier across the wider public service.   CRS is a complete database of all the historical tax reference numbers which were used to pre-populate the database in 1979 and every PPS number which has been issued since then.  In addition to those persons currently resident in the State who have been issued with a PPS Number, the figure of 7.4 million also includes any individual who, since 1979, required a PPS number and;</p>

            <p eId="para_2091">The Data Protection Commissioner is fully aware of the Department's investment in technology and how it is prioritising the security of customer information in its latest generation ICT systems. He has this knowledge from his audit of the Department in 2008 and subsequent ongoing progress reports and meetings with my officials. The Department continues to work closely with the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure that its information security standards and protocols reflect the highest international standards, in order to provide assurance to its customers that their personal information is fully protected and processed in a secure manner.   My Department administers more than 50 separate social welfare schemes and services. Over one million people each week receive a social welfare payment.  The nature and volume of its business means that my Department is heavily dependent on ICT facilities to carry out the bulk of its business and it bears responsibility for a significant amount of personal data.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">The Department is fully aware of its obligation to safeguard the security of these data. It employs a wide range of measures to protect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information.   Over the past few years, the Department has undertaken a number of Information Security projects.  Examples of the work currently ongoing in this area include the development of a range of information security protocols, the classification and tagging of all personal data held on the Department's information systems and the implementation of an identity and access management framework.  In addition, technical work has been carried out on the Department's infrastructures and systems.  The Department is also ensuring that higher levels of data protection are built into its latest generation of ICT systems to reflect the increased threats in this area.  Considerable resources have also been devoted to increasing the security and monitoring facilities in its older systems.</p>

            <p eId="para_2094">The number of applications received for each of the main disability schemes in 2010 is set out in the following table. All applications for disability allowance, invalidity pension and domiciliary care allowance are desk assessed by the department's medical assessors who examine all the relevant medical reports and evidence submitted by the applicant.  The practise of referring disability allowance and invalidity pension applications for in person assessments was phased out early in 2010.  Consequently, the number of cases which underwent an in person assessment was low, as shown in table.</p>
            <p eId="para_2095">Illness benefit is a payment for insured people who cannot work due to illness and who satisfy the pay related social insurance conditions.  The benefit is paid weekly, in arrears, on receipt of required medical certification signed by an applicant's doctor. While receiving illness benefit a person's claim may be reviewed and he/she may be required to attend a medical assessment by one of the department's medical assessors. Injury benefit is paid and reviewed on the same basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">All disablement benefit applications are referred to a medical assessor who carries out an in person assessment of the applicant's percentage loss of faculty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">Medical assessors are fully qualified and experienced practitioners who provide a second opinion to that of the person's own doctor for the guidance of the department's deciding officers. Their assessments conform to the ethical conduct and behaviour guidelines of the Medical Council. Medical assessors are required to be medical practitioners who are on the general register of medical practitioners while holding an appointment. They must have at least six years satisfactory experience in the practice of medicine since registration. Many of the medical assessors have specialist post-graduate qualifications and all have received special training in human disability evaluation.  They also have special training in eligibility assessment and all are trained in disability evaluation. The medical assessors have an ongoing commitment to continuing medical education to ensure that standards are maintained and enhanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">When conducting an assessment, the medical assessor does not dispute the existence of the certified cause of incapacity but rather s/he assesses the degree to which the loss of function in work-related activities, resulting from disease or injury, affects the person's ability to perform either their own job or alternative types of work.</p>

            <p eId="para_2121">The National Internship Scheme JobBridge is a key part of the Government's Jobs Initiative. It will provide up to 5,000 unemployed people with an internship opportunity ranging from 6 to 9 months in an organisation in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors. During this time participants will receive an allowance, which will consist of a €50 per week top up on their existing social welfare entitlements.  The Internship scheme will assist in breaking that cycle whereby unemployed people cannot get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers whose existing skills will not be appropriate to the types of jobs that will emerge in post- recession Ireland.  The scheme will give young people a real opportunity to gain valuable experience to bridge the gap between study and the beginning of their working lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">In order for the scheme to be a success, host organisations must offer meaningful internships that allow participants to enhance their current skills and to learn new ones.  To this end, a clear set of rules have been developed to protect the intern and safeguard JobBridge from potential abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">In order for an application from a host organisation to be put up on the JobBridge site it must meet a number of criteria so as to ensure that the potential internship is one of quality.  These include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">That the placement does not allow the intern to work unsupervised;</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">That the intern accrues significant experience throughout the entire placement;</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">That an internship will not be approved where, in the absence of the intern, the organisation would have to recruit an employee to carry out the tasks identified in the internship.</p>
            <p eId="para_2127">Following this application process, in order for an internship to commence, a Standard Internship Agreement must be signed by both the intern and the host organisation.  This Agreement clearly stipulates the terms of the internship including the maximum number of hours an intern is expected to work in a week, their entitlement to rest breaks, annual leave and sick leave.  To ensure compliance with the scheme the Department of Social Protection and the Employment  Services Division of FÁS are monitoring internships to ensure that they are of sufficient quality and that both host organisations and interns are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2128">In this regard, each host organisation will be required to submit monthly compliance reports verifying that the internship is proceeding as set out in the Standard Internship Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2129">Also, the Employment Services of FÁS will undertake random site visits of internships as part of this process.  In addition, a ‘whistle blowing' feature has been introduced where any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme's criteria may contact the National Call Centre.  All such claims will be investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_2130">The control mechanisms and conditions have been put in place to protect the integrity of the scheme and to ensure that the intern and host organisation both benefit from the arrangement.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_2132">I am informed that given the very varied nature and complexity of the work undertaken, counsel is not paid an hourly rate by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. Measurement of counsel's fees is governed by the nature and extent of the work done by counsel and the features of each particular case. The factors taken into account in assessing counsel's fee include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2133">The amount of time likely to have been  reasonably spent on the work</p>
            <p eId="para_2134">The number of documents perused and their importance and technicality</p>
            <p eId="para_2135">The specialist knowledge and skill of counsel</p>
            <p eId="para_2136">The complexity of the work undertaken</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">The difficulty or novelty of the questions involved</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">The value of the claim and its importance</p>
            <p eId="para_2139">The responsibility involved</p>
            <p eId="para_2140">The place and circumstances where the work is performed</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">Whether there is any overlap with other work performed by counsel which reduces the work that would otherwise have been necessary</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">The performance of counsel.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is involved only in criminal cases, does not pay barristers an hourly rate either, but rather uses a range of standard fees.  The principal categories of fees, covering 95% of the fees paid, are brief fees, refresher fees, sentence fees and bail fees. The brief fee is payable for the first day of a trial or, if the case does not go to trial, the day the defendant pleads guilty.  It covers both the work involved in preparing the case for trial and the appearance on the day in question. The current brief fee for junior counsel in the Circuit Court is €1,272. The brief fee paid to junior counsel in the Central Criminal Court is €4,225 in rape cases and €5,280 in murder cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">A refresher fee is payable for the second and subsequent days of a trial.  The current refresher fee for junior counsel in the Circuit Court is €636. The refresher fee paid to junior counsel in the Central Criminal Court is €1,157.</p>
            <p eId="para_2145">A sentence fee is paid for hearings that deal with the passing of sentence. There may be more than one such hearing in a case. The current sentence fee for junior counsel is €274.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">A bail fee is payable for hearings where the defendant applies for bail and the matter is contested. The current bail fee for junior counsel is €196.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">Where cases are heard in the Central Criminal Court, a senior counsel will also usually be appointed.  On occasion, a senior counsel may be appointed to deal with a particularly complex case in the Circuit Court.  The fees paid to senior counsel are one-and-a-half times the junior counsel rate.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2149">The Horn of Africa is experiencing the most severe food crisis in the world today.  Between ten and twelve million people are severely affected in drought-stricken areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Uganda — a thirty percent increase since the beginning of the year. The immediate cause of the crisis is a prolonged drought and the failure of at least two seasonal rains, with the situation severely compounded by the ongoing conflict in Somalia, where humanitarian access remains limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">The Government has been following and responding to this growing humanitarian emergency for many months.  At the beginning of 2011, in anticipation of a severe crisis, we pre-approved humanitarian funding of €4 million for UN Agencies and NGOs working in the region and in more recent weeks followed this with the disbursal of additional funding for Concern and Trócaire for their operations in Somalia and Kenya.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">As the crisis deepened and in close consultation with the major UN agencies operating on the ground, I last week approved an additional €1 million in funding for emergency food relief and assistance to refugees across the region. Some €750,000 of this funding will help the United Nations World Food Programme in its efforts to dramatically increase the distribution of highly-nutritious foodstuffs to young children and pregnant women, and other vulnerable groups.  The remaining €250,000 is being provided to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to support this agency in providing shelter, health care, water and sanitation to the many thousands of Somali refugees fleeing to Ethiopia and Kenya from the drought and conflict in their own country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">Last week's announcement brings to €5.6 million the Government's funding to Concern, Trócaire, Goal and World Vision for emergency food, water, sanitation and health care, and to the United Nations agencies in the region so far this year.  In addition, 11 members of the Rapid Response Corps administered by Irish Aid have deployed to the region. The Corps is made up of highly-skilled volunteers who work with UN and other humanitarian agencies in crisis situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">Ireland also remains a major contributor to the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which was established in 2006 following the Asian Tsunami to provide immediately-accessible funds to the UN for use in a crisis such as that currently under way in the Horn of Africa.  Funds are now being drawn down by a range of UN agencies from the CERF for drought-related activities across the region.  Ireland has contributed a total of €81 million to the CERF since 2006, including €4 million so far this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2154">Irish Aid will remain in close contact with the UN and other humanitarian agencies in the Horn of Africa in order to assess how Ireland might best contribute to assisting the international relief effort.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" eId="spk_883">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_2159">There are currently 41,223 passport applications in the system, which are being processed by the Passport Offices in Molesworth Street, Balbriggan, Cork and London.  This is down by 10,019<b/>(24%) on the figure of 51,242 which was given in reply to Question No. 76 of 12 July, 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">This reflects an improved situation in passport services with the turnaround period for Passport Express applications, for instance, at 11 working days which is down from 15 working days.  The combined measures of the recruitment of temporary staff, the use of overtime and the redeployment of staff and work within the Passport Service continue to be effective in bringing passport service levels back to normal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">These efforts should be seen in the context of the number of applications received so far this year. Year to date demand on all passport services is 12% up on 2009 levels.  The figures for 2010 are not a reliable comparison due to the impact of last year's industrial action.  In addition, the Passport Service received an average of 3,300 applications per day last week which is down from a daily average of around 4,000 applications for the months of May and June.  This reduction provides some evidence that passport demand is beginning to ease.  This trend is expected to continue as progress is made towards the end of the traditional summer season. The decrease in demand on passport services in the coming weeks will help our ongoing efforts to bring all passport services back to their standard service levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">However, this reduction is still not reflected in the unprecedented demand for passports at short notice.  It is not unusual for over 400 people to submit applications for a short notice priority passport service at the public office in Molesworth Street.  In the context of these very high and unpredictable numbers of customers using the public counter service, it is clearly not possible, despite the best efforts of the Passport Office staff to be of assistance, to accommodate all requests for a short notice service.  Citizens are advised that the public counter services should only be used in cases of genuine emergency.  Priority at the public counters will be given to those who have a verifiable necessity to travel for reasons of family emergency i.e. travel is necessitated by the death, illness or welfare of a family member.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">It should also be stressed that to protect the integrity of the system and the quality of the passport, the Passport Service cannot provide standard passports within a single day.  The shortest turnaround time available, other than in cases of genuine emergency, is three working days for applications received over the public counter, accompanied by proof of travel. Priority will continue to be given to applications made through the Passport Express Services and Irish-based customers are strongly encouraged to use that service. Notice of the current extended turnaround time and its likely duration has been published on the Passport Service website <i>www.passport.ie</i>. The Passport Office has also informed An Post so that customers can be advised of the situation at the point of application.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">The overwhelming numbers of applications that have been submitted through the ordinary post passport service or those that have been made through Ireland's overseas Missions are currently taking over 6 weeks to be processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">I would like to express my regret at the length of time that it is taking to deliver all passport services to the customers of the Passport Service.  However, I would strongly appeal to the public to assist the Passport Service by checking the validity of their passports well in advance of making bookings to travel abroad.  A valid passport should be the first item on any check list when considering foreign travel.</p>

            <p eId="para_2171">I can confirm that the fee for applications submitted through ordinary post is an extra €15, which is €6.50 more than those applications submitted through Passport Express, allowing for the Post Office charge of €8.50.  The new fee was brought into effect by the Statutory Instrument 47 of 2011, which was advertised in the national press before its implementation on 11 April 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2172">The difference in the fees charged is designed to encourage people to submit their applications through the Passport Express Service.  The logging of the application by the Post Office enables the Passport Service to provide a much more efficient service of registration, tracking and production than applications submitted through the ordinary post.  However, it is ultimately the choice of the customer which service they select.  Applications submitted by ordinary post are, at present, taking six weeks and reducing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2173">Advertisements outlining the price increases were published in national newspapers.

I have asked the institutions to compile data on remuneration practices and details with a view, as part of the remuneration review presently being conducted by the institutions at the request of my Department, to improving transparency on the issue.  I will endeavour to have this completed in light of the above comments in the shortest timeframe possible with a view to putting the information into the public domain.</p>

            <p eId="para_2204">I assume the Deputy is referring to Parliamentary Question No. 97 of 7 June 2011, which asked if I would provide an itemised list of all bonuses paid to staff of the National Asset Management Agency since its establishment.  In my reply, I explained that all officers of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) are employees of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and that the remuneration packages of all NTMA staff are negotiated on an individual contract basis and are confidential.  This is the current factual position.</p>
            <p eId="para_2205">Parliamentary Question No. 71 of 29 June 2011 asked for more general information on bonuses paid at an NTMA-wide level, specifically details of the number of persons employed by the National Treasury Management Agency, including NAMA, who received bonus payments in 2010, the overall amount that was paid and the average payment to the employees in question.  In my reply, I stated that the average payment made by the NTMA in February 2011 in respect of performance in 2010 was €7,681, that the overall amount paid was €1,981,760, representing 6.6% of the NTMA's overall payroll and that payments were made to 258 staff members.  The information that I provided in my reply of 29 June was at an aggregate level and, in line with my reply on 7 June 2011, it did not provide information on payments made to individual employees of the NTMA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2206">I am satisfied that both questions were answered appropriately and I would also like to reassure the Deputy that it is my policy to answer all Parliamentary Questions put down to me by all Members of the House in as clear and comprehensive a manner as possible.  Greater transparency in relation to expenditure on public services is a desirable objective.  As I indicated in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 5 July 2011, it is my intention to examine the approach to remuneration in the NTMA in more detail in the coming months following consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I will then see what changes, if any, might be appropriate in relation to the remuneration of all staff in the NTMA, having regard to the changing economic circumstances of the State and the need for transparency in public expenditure.</p>

            <p eId="para_2210">There is no automatic linkage between ECB interest rate changes and the interest rates charged by the EU and the IMF on their various loans to Ireland.  In the case of the IMF, the Special Drawing Rights (SDR)  interest rate is somewhat influenced by a European 3-month collateralised lending rate, EUREPO, which is correlated, but not linked, to the ECB interest rate.  The other elements of the IMF's SDR interest rate are the returns on 3-month U.S. Treasury Bills, three-month U.K. Treasury Bills and three-month Japanese Treasury Discount Bills.  However, this SDR interest rate is a minor component of the overall cost and most of the IMF interest rate to Ireland is made up of surcharges.  The NTMA has converted the interest rate liabilities to the IMF to fixed rate euro borrowings thereby averting any minor influence that ECB interest rate changes may have on the IMF interest rate for borrowings already entered into.</p>
            <p eId="para_2211">In the case of new borrowings, the level of short term interest rates is one of a number of factors influencing the level of long term interest rates and through this the cost of borrowing.  In the case of the EFSF and EFSM, the interest rates charged to Ireland on existing borrowings are fixed and, therefore, not directly influenced by ECB interest rate changes so that any influence is indirect.  With respect to their future lending to Ireland, it is not possible to say to what extent ECB interest rate changes will have a bearing.</p>

The Deputy will be aware of the work of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt. This Group published its final report in November 2010.  All of the Groups recommendations are listed in Chapter 2 of the Report which can be accessed at <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2218">One of the recommendations of the Group was that lenders should offer a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS) to borrowers.  Under this Scheme, subject to certain criteria being satisfied, borrowers are allowed to pay at least 66% of their mortgage interest but less than 100%.  Payment of the balance may be deferred for up to 5 years.  Lenders representing the majority of the market have already implemented (or indicated their willingness to implement) the Groups proposals for a DIS or a variation of it.  While the Scheme is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the Scheme will be monitored by the Central Bank to ensure compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2219">Since the publication of the Groups Report, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) has been revised by the Central Bank to reflect many of the Groups recommendations, including key recommendations relating to the introduction by all lenders regulated by the Central Bank of a standardised Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  The most significant changes in the revised CCMA include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2220">penalty interest charges may not be imposed on borrowers in arrears who co-operate with the MARP,</p>
            <p eId="para_2221">harassment of borrowers through unsolicited communication is outlawed,</p>
            <p eId="para_2222">borrowers in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, are allowed to come under the MARP,</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">when determining the 12 month period the lender must wait before applying to the courts to commence legal action, the lender must exclude any time period during which the borrower is complying with the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement, making an appeal to the internal appeals board or making a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p>
            <p eId="para_2224">The revised CCMA came into effect on 1 January 2011 and can be accessed at <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>. Lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law.  With effect from 30 June 2011, lenders must have in place the requisite systems and trained staff necessary to support the implementation of the MARP.  Financial assistance is available to eligible claimants under the Department of Social Protections Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme.  People in debt or in danger of getting into debt can also avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  This is a national, free, confidential and independent service.</p>

In addition, General Government debt is a gross measure and it does not allow for the netting off of cash balances, which had been built up considerably in recent years, so adding greatly to General Government debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_2231">The forecast General Government Debt to GDP ratios for the years 2011 to 2015 published in the Stability Programme Update in April last are set out in the following table.</p>

            <p eId="para_2242">While debt levels are currently very high, up until as recently as 2008 Ireland's debt was among the lowest in the EU. Since then, debt levels have risen considerably throughout Europe as a result of the financial crisis.  Indeed, in 2010, the average eurozone general government debt exceeded 85% of GDP.  Although General Government Debt is estimated on reasonable assumptions to continue to rise in the short term it is expected to peak in 2013 and begin to fall thereafter, and is thus sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2243">Of course sustainability is predicated on a whole host of factors, including assumptions regarding future economic growth and interest costs, amongst other things.  But in addition to our own estimates, as indicated in the table, the IMF, the European Commission and others also believe that our debt is sustainable (provided the appropriate fiscal and structural programmes are maintained), and on that basis have been prepared to make large loans to us.  One measure which may be referenced in forming a judgment of whether or not a particular level of debt is sustainable is the proportion of tax revenues that must go towards servicing the interest on that debt.  Based on the Stability Programme Update projections, it is estimated that around 15 per cent of tax revenues will be required to service the interest on the State's national debt this year.  By 2015, almost 21 per cent of our total tax revenues will be required for that purpose.  This is undoubtedly a significant level, but it is worth bearing in mind that it is well below the ratios experienced in the mid-1980s when around a third of the tax revenues generated in the State went towards servicing the interest on the national debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_2244">The first step in ensuring that our debt remains sustainable is to stop the debt from rising any further. Stabilising the debt is one of this Governments key policy objectives and that is why we are implementing policies which both consolidate the budgetary position and foster economic growth.  The Government is committed to bringing the General Government deficit back below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015, and this is very important in achieving debt sustainability.</p>

            <p eId="para_2247">I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2248">As the Deputy will be aware, in March 2011, the Euro Area Heads of State and Government agreed in principle to a reduction in the interest margin charged to programme countries.  This has been applied in respect of Greece and Portugal. However, a decision to apply it to Ireland's loans has not yet been taken.  This is because another Member State is asking for Ireland to deliver a quid pro quo in return for an interest rate reduction in the form of a change in our Corporation Tax. However, we have made it clear that we will not agree to this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2249">It is the Government's strong position that the margin being charged on loans from both the EFSM and the EFSF is excessive.  This argument, which has been supported by the European Commission, is one that I and my Government colleagues plus our officials make at every possible opportunity. In my recent engagements with Troika senior officials I raised the issue of programme pricing.  I have also continued to do so at every suitable opportunity at EU level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2250">The Government also avails of every suitable opportunity to press our case to have the reductions applied for the Greek and Portuguese programmes applied to Ireland.  The value of any reduction granted to Ireland compared to what was agreed previously for Greece will be known if and when a decision is taken on granting such a reduction, and on the terms and conditions on which it is to be granted.  This issue has now moved primarily to the political sphere. It has been raised on a number of occasions in the past two months, including the Taoiseach's meeting with President Sarkozy at last months European Council, the Tánaiste's meeting with his French colleague, Foreign Minister Juppé, and my own bilateral with the previous French Finance Minister Lagarde.  The issue is a key agenda item at tomorrow's meeting of Euro Area Heads of State and Government — where the Taoiseach will once again present the Government's established position on the broader issue of the appropriate rate for the EU programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2251">In relation to the application of any reduction, it is my understanding that any interest rate margin reduction secured will apply to interest due on both existing and future drawdowns, but will not apply to any interest payments already made.  In this context, I would refer the Deputy to my response to PQ 15570 of 14 June last.</p>

            <p eId="para_2253">Quarterly Irish economic data can be very volatile and is subject to non-negligible revisions.  This was evident once again in the latest Quarterly National Accounts, which revealed that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, GNP fell by 4.3 per cent quarter on quarter in Q1 2011 following positive growth of 0.3 per cent in Q4 2010.  The previous estimate for the last quarter of 2010 was 2 per cent growth.  Given this volatility, my Department's growth forecasts are based on annual averages rather than quarterly figures.  On this basis, my Department's latest forecasts — set out in the Irish Stability Programme Update which was published at the end of April — are outlined in the following table.  Growth will continue to be export driven over the short term before broadening out to the domestic side of the economy from 2013 onwards.</p>

            <p eId="para_2272">The household savings rate in Ireland is currently at a high level relative to its historical average.  This reflects the need to repair household balance sheets, the uncertain external environment, weak labour market conditions and concern surrounding forthcoming budgets.  My Department forecasts that the savings rate will remain at a relatively high level over the coming years but with a gradual moderation over the forecast horizon (2011-2015) as confidence returns to the economy.  One of the major obstacles holding back investment in the Irish economy is lack of confidence and certainty about our future.  This Government has acted swiftly and resolutely to rebuild this confidence.  We have stabilised the public finances and recapitalised the banking system and are vigorously implementing the terms of the EU/IMF agreement which will see our deficit fall below the 3 per cent of GDP target by 2015.  In addition there have been significant improvements in our competitiveness, and this has contributed to a recovery in our exports and a pick up in inward Foreign Direct Investment, which underpinned the expansion of GDP in the first quarter of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2288">Quarterly Irish economic data can be very volatile.  This was evident once again in the latest Quarterly National Household Survey data, which revealed that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the unemployment rate fell from 14.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2010 to 14 per cent in the first quarter of this year.  Reflecting this, my Department's labour market forecasts are based on annual averages rather than quarterly figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2289">On this basis, my Department's latest forecasts — set out in the Irish Stability Programme Update which was published at the end of April — are outlined in Table 2.  Given that recovery in the labour market typically lags that in economic activity, a further decline in employment in net terms is anticipated this year.  Furthermore, with growth set to be driven by less labour-intensive export demand over the forecast horizon, employment will recover at a moderate pace.  Nevertheless, net employment growth is forecast to return in 2012 and to continue in the following years.  In total around 100,000 net jobs are expected to be created over the period 2012 to 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_2290">In terms of longer term trends, it is important to emphasise that Ireland's underlying economic strengths remain intact despite the very sharp downturn that we have experienced.  These strengths include a well-educated work force, relatively favourable demographics, a very open economy with a high tech export base and a pro-enterprise environment.  These underlying strengths should continue to support economic growth in the longer-term and this will, in turn, create net employment growth in the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2305">Ireland recorded a current account surplus in 2010 for the first time since 1999.  This is very encouraging and shows that Ireland is paying its way in the world.  The balance of payments is split between the public sector balance and the private sector balance.  The public sector element of the balance of payments has a significant deficit.  For example the exchequer deficit in 2010 was €18.7 billion and is forecast to be over €18 billion again this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2306">On the private sector side, the savings rate is at historically high levels.  This reflects the fact that Irish companies and individuals are paying down their own debt as well as increasing their precautionary savings.  This is resulting in a significant private sector current account surplus.  The extent of this surplus outweighs the large public sector deficit.  There are obvious tax implications from the higher level of household savings on deposit in the Irish banking system through DIRT.  However, DIRT represents just over 1% of the overall tax take and that is unlikely to increase significantly this year, notwithstanding the increase in the DIRT rate from 25% to 27%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2307">The Government is committed to implementing an overall adjustment package of at least €3.6 billion in 2012.  This is to ensure the deficit target for 2012 can be achieved.  As we go through the second half of the year, we will have to study closely the emerging trends, both positive and negative, and formulate what the likely outlook for 2012 will be.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2309">I note the recent disimprovement in the month-on-month nominal Harmonised Competitiveness Indicators (HCI).  This has been evident for just a few months of 2011 and reflects the recent strengthening of the euro exchange rate.  It goes without saying that if this trend persisted over a longer period of time it would be a concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_2310">However, in year-on-year (y-o-y) terms the nominal HCI actually improved in the first four months of 2011.  Furthermore, I would direct the Deputy to the real HCI, which deflates the HCI by consumer prices.  In this context, it is worth noting that on an EU harmonised basis, Ireland has had the lowest rate of inflation in the euro area over the last two years.  Indeed, Irish inflation this year and next year will continue to be lower than in the euro area.  This moderate rate of inflation has resulted in a much greater improvement (y-o-y) in the HCI in real terms when compared to the nominal improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2311">The Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator is not the only metric which can be used for gauging competitiveness developments.  With regard to cost competitiveness, we are seeing the benefits of our labour market flexibility: according to the European Commission, unit labour costs — wages adjusted for productivity — declined in Ireland by 6% in 2009 and 2010, compared to a 4% increase in the euro area.  Looking to the future, a further decline of 3% is expected by 2012 compared to an increase of 2% in the euro area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2312">While the recent price and wage adjustments together with improvements in productivity are helpful, we must not be complacent as further improvements in our competitiveness are essential to take advantage of the global recovery.  To this end, both the Programme for Government and the EU/IMF Programme set out a series of structural reforms which will help to further restore competitiveness and support economic growth.</p>

            <p eId="para_2333">Estimates of the structural deficit are determined on the basis of the harmonised methodology, developed jointly by the EU Commission and the Member States, to decompose the headline deficit into its cyclical and structural components.  This structural deficit, by definition, excludes all one-off measures, which in an Irish context are primarily composed of fiscal supports to the banking sector.  In practice, all estimates of the structural position are subject to considerable uncertainty, the sources of which have been outlined in an annex in the latest Stability Programme Update.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">Notwithstanding these considerable uncertainties, the figures in Table 1 indicate that a significant part of the deficit is structural in nature, and so will not be eliminated with economic recovery.  The structural deficit is projected to decrease substantially over the next five years in line with ongoing fiscal consolidation.  Although not fully eliminated, the budget deficit will be at a much more sustainable level at the end of this period.  It is worth noting that the structural primary balance, which excludes interest expenditure from the calculations, is projected to return to positive territory in 2014.</p>

In that context, the ECB cannot take account of the unique positions of individual Member States when considering interest rate changes.

            <p eId="para_2414">(2) Original investment of €3.5bn, of this €1.7bn converted to equity in May 2010</p>
            <p eId="para_2415">As the Deputy will be aware, the Financial Measures Programme ("FMP") announced on 31 March 2011 included an independent loan loss assessment exercise performed by BlackRock Solutions ("BlackRock"), the results of which have informed the calculation of capital requirements for AIB, Bank of Ireland, EBS and ILP under the PCAR.  The PLAR completed as part of that Programme will set banks specific funding targets consistent with Basel III and other international measures of stable, high quality funding.  The PLAR will outline measures to be implemented with a view to steadily deleveraging the banking system and reducing the bank's reliance on short term funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2416">As I have said previously in my Statement on Banking in March, the PCAR bank stress tests carried out by the Central Bank are certainly among the most thorough and demanding such tests ever performed in Ireland and or indeed anywhere.  The detailed results methodology and assumptions underlying these stress tests have been published, emphasising Ireland's firm commitment for this critical exercise to be fully open and transparent.  In addition to the very conservative economic assumptions built into the capital scenarios the Central Bank has gone further than its international peers in setting its requirements by taking a three year, rather than two year outlook and also by requiring capital levels after any stress losses of 6%, rather than 5% of Risk Weighted Assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2417">In specific terms I am satisfied on the basis of the results of the PCAR assessment carried out by the Central Bank, which have been endorsed by the external authorities, that the loan loss assumptions made reflects a high degree of conservatism and underpin the robustness and credibility of the exercise overall.  It should be noted that stress testing is used by banking supervisors to determine whether a bank is adequately capitalised to withstand adverse macro-economic events or unanticipated shocks.  Our banks will be well capitalised by international standards following the recapitalisation measures but this position will not then remain frozen in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2418">I would nevertheless reiterate that based on the conservative assessments used in the PCAR/PLAR analysis of potential future scenarios for the banks, and indeed the Irish economy, I am entirely satisfied that the banks are currently well capitalised to serve the needs of the Irish economy following this round of measures.</p>

As the Deputy may know already, the single biggest driver of this decline has been the loss of corporate and institutional deposits from overseas as credit ratings on Irish banks and indeed the sovereign were reduced.  This trend has effectively run its course.  The overall trend in deposits has been stabilising in recent months particularly since the banking announcement on March 31st last.</p>

            <p eId="para_2423">The banks involved in the PCAR process submitted detailed deleveraging plans for the three years to the 31 December 2013 to the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) as part of the Financial Measures Programme, which was announced on 31 March 2011.  These plans outlined how the institutions would achieve a loan-to-deposit ratio of 122.5% by end 2013.  To monitor progress, semi-annual interim targets have been set for each of the institutions and progress against these targets will be reported every six months.  The first reporting date by the institutions to the CBI is 31 December 2011.  Subsequent to 31 March 2011, AIB and BOI were required to provide alternative deleveraging options to account for the fact that the transfer of sub-EUR 20 million land and development loans to NAMA will now no longer take place.  These plans were submitted to the CBI in May 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2424">The Deputy will be aware that the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period.  In each bank, a team of senior managers will be dedicated to the task of ensuring lending continues to grow to support economic growth.  This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_2434">The Deputy will be aware of my Statement on Banking of 31 March 2011 where I set out Government policy in relation to the matters the Deputy has raised.  As part of the PCAR 2011 results further recapitalisation measures are required to enable AIB/EBS, Bank of Ireland and IL&amp;P to meet their regulatory capital requirements set by the Central Bank.     The State has committed to completing the recapitalisations to the extent possible by 31 July as part of the Programme of Financial Support for Ireland and there are no plans to change to an alternative recapitalisation strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2435">The Government has, however, instigated processes which have reduced and will further reduce the cost to the State by looking for significant contributions from subordinated debt holders, by the sale of assets to generate capital and, where possible, by seeking private sector investors.  It is expected that the effect of these actions will be to reduce the amount of capital required by the State very significantly.  In particular, a number of the financial institutions have recently engaged in liability management exercises in relation to subordinated debt which have resulted in the generation of some €4.4bn in Core Tier 1 Capital, reducing accordingly the amount required to be contributed by the State to the €24bn PCAR capital requirement.</p>

            <p eId="para_2458">Having regard to the commitments</p>
            <p eId="para_2459">in the Programme for National Government 2011-2016 to review the future of the credit union movement and to make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions, and</p>
            <p eId="para_2460">under the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland to design a strategy for the future evolution of the credit union sector, to assist credit unions with a strengthened regulatory framework including more effective governance and regulatory requirements and to make recommendations to the Minister on legislation to be submitted to the Oireachtas by end-2011; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">taking into account</p>
            <p eId="para_2462">the not-for-profit mandate of credit unions, their volunteer ethos and community focus, paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors' savings and financial stability,</p>
            <p eId="para_2463">the comprehensive strategy to enhance the viability of the credit union sector prepared under the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland;</p>
            <p eId="para_2464">international best practice in the structure, organisation and regulation of credit unions or analogous entities; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2465">the strengths and weaknesses of the sector as set out in work done in the Strategic Review of the Credit Union Sector in Ireland;</p>
            <p eId="para_2466">the Commission on Credit Unions is invited to:</p>
            <p eId="para_2467">1. Define the role of credit unions in the context of a restructured financial services sector.   This will focus on the credit union as a cooperative, owned and run by its members and providing its members with the financial services that they require. Consideration will also be given to the role of the credit union in relation to the community in general. In particular, the objects of a credit union as set out under section 6 of the Credit Union Act 1997 will be examined including the function of the common bond in the context of modern financial services systems. The Commission should also consider the question of the prudential supervision of loan societies and credit cooperatives registered under the Friendly Societies Act 1896 and the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893 that engage in taking deposits from and providing loans to their members and make recommendations in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2468">2. Propose a model for modern credit unions and define the structure/parameters   within which financially viable credit unions will operate. At the same time, the Commission will examine how credit unions may continue to provide the services required by their members while meeting regulatory requirements sufficient to protect the savings of depositors and the financial stability of the credit union sector as a whole. This should examine how the size of a credit union, the variety and complexity of the services it provides and the competencies of its management and staff influence its viability. The question of credit unions competing with the larger financial institutions should be studied.</p>
            <p eId="para_2469">3. Options for restructuring. The Commission will make recommendations on the possibility of voluntary consolidation or restructuring of the credit union sector over time, recognising the need to maintain local presence and taking into account the not for-profit mandate, the volunteer ethos and community focus of credit unions. In this consideration, due regard must be given to the need to protect depositors savings and financial stability. Central Bank of Ireland proposals in relation to possible restructuring of some credit unions should be examined and recommendations made to the Minister for Finance as these may arise over the term of the Commission. The Commission is required to engage with the Department of Finance, make recommendations and exchange information on legislative proposals during the course of its deliberations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2470">4. Shared services. The Commission will examine the options for groups of credit unions to share services on a formal basis and the extent to which this model is appropriate. The Commission should consider which services are most suitable for delivery by a separate entity, e.g. purchasing, auditing, compliance, credit control, legal, marketing, human resource management, administration and training. Progress in relation to the introduction of modern information technology and management information systems for and in credit unions will be examined and recommendations made in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2471">5. Determine and set out the basic governance and regulatory requirements that must be met.   The Commission will focus on a set of benchmarks that credit unions should meet if they are to be registered to operate in the State. These benchmarks should include capital requirements, sizes of loan books and of loans, competencies of directors and staff, investments policy, fitness and probity and governance standards. Recommendations will be made in relation to management reporting arrangements both internally and with the Registry of Credit Unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2472">6. Make recommendations for legislative change.   The Commission will examine the existing legislation and in particular the Credit Union Act 1997 and make recommendations on changes required to implement their findings. The Commission should make initial recommendations required to strengthen the regulatory framework of credit unions by 30 September 2011. A final report should be submitted to the Minister for Finance by 31 March 2012.</p>

In April 2005, the Chinese Government signed an agreement between the European Union, including its Member States, and the People's Republic of China on co-operation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters. This agreement provides the legal basis for OLAF, or an individual Member State, to seek the assistance of the Chinese Authorities in the course of cigarette smuggling investigations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2533">The European Commission, through OLAF, has established a special Unit titled Task Group Cigarettes to assist Member States in their investigations where the assistance of third country authorities is required. This Unit has an overseas officer stationed in Beijing on a permanent basis. The Revenue Commissioners have availed of the assistance of this posting to enhance liaison with the Chinese Authorities in the course of its investigations into large maritime seizures of contraband cigarettes originating in China.</p>
            <p eId="para_2534">The Revenue Commissioners regard the tackling of the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products to be a high priority.  Their strategy includes the development and sharing of intelligence on a national, EU and international basis; the use of analytics and detection technologies; and the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and inland to intercept contraband tobacco product and to prosecute those involved.</p>

         the position regarding the proposed merger of EBS and AIB; if all the EBS staff will transfer to AIB; if the EBS and AIB branch system will be reconfigured; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2536">Since 1 July 2011 EBS has been a fully owned subsidiary which benefits from the full support of AIB.  The new merged entity will be a stronger and more domestically focused institution which will leave it better placed to service the needs of the Irish economy and will help return the banking system to long-term viability. As announced on the date of the transaction, EBS Limited will initially operate as a standalone, separately branded subsidiary of AIB with its own branch network and the terms and conditions of customers' financial products remain unchanged following the transfer. As a result of the combination, existing EBS staff were also transferred and will initially continue in their previous roles.</p>
            <p eId="para_2537">This combination is part of the Government's strategy to return the banking system to long-term viability and profitability so it is no longer reliant on State support. The completion of the merger is a structural benchmark under the EU/IMF programme for support and the merger was completed ahead of schedule, three months after it was initially announced.  The future organisational and operational structure of the combined entity is under detailed consideration and will be finalised over time in a manner which creates the strongest possible bank which can best meet the future needs of the Irish banking system.</p>

            <p eId="para_2773">The First Destination Report has been compiled annually by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) since 1982.  The facts and figures presented in the FDR report have been instrumental in communicating the importance of higher education and helping to illustrate how education benefits the individual, society, research activity and the country in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">The tables set out are based on the First Destination of Award Recipients in Higher Education Survey (FDR), an annual survey conducted by the Higher Education Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Careers Officers in all institutions under the aegis of the HEA.  The FDR surveys every graduate of publicly funded third level institutions (and HETAC approved courses in private institutions) in order to portray their circumstances nine months after graduation.  The HEA analyses the datasets produced by these agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">They include an analysis of those in employment and those seeking employment in addition to levels of participation in further study and training.  Graduates of all higher education qualifications are surveyed, from Higher/University Certificates to PhDs.  It is important to reiterate that the data contained in this report are based on information provided by graduates nine months after they graduate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">The survey results will continue to be of particular relevance to those in higher education including educators, Government Departments, policy makers and research organisations.  The findings will also be of interest to students, teachers and career guidance counsellors at second level to inform their future careers.</p>

The class teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in their class, including any pupil with a special educational need. In this task, the teacher may be supported by a learning support teacher and/or resource teacher. As a result, the allocation of SNAs in each school can alter from year to year. Some schools may receive an increased allocation, while others may experience a reduction because the allocation of supports are provided in line with the needs of individual schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4856">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special needs resources to schools to support children with special educational needs.

The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_4876">Changes to the School Transport Schemes were announced in Budget 2011 and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4877">The decisions announced include the uniform application of the distance requirement, the cessation of the Closed/Central School Rule (CSR), an increase in the minimum number of eligible children required to establish or retain a service and the introduction of charges for eligible primary pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_4878">Bus Éireann has identified a number of services that will be withdrawn from the commencement of the 2011-12 school year where the number of applications received from eligible pupils has fallen below the minimum number required to retain a school transport service. Bus Éireann is continuing to monitor the situation and some services may be restored if late applications/payments are received.</p>
            <p eId="para_4879">The list of the services in question is available on my Department's website and includes details of the number of eligible pupils that have applied for school transport for 2011-12 school year. This number of eligible pupils is the same as the number of eligible pupils that travelled to the schools in question last year. Pupils applying for concessionary transport are not considered when calculating the minimum number requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4880">As is currently the position, families of eligible pupils, for whom there is no school transport service available, may apply for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4881">The cost of individual routes or services is regarded as commercially sensitive. However, the estimate is that savings of €3 million will accrue from the combination of the changes. It is essential to stress that the wider context within which all these changes are taking place, is a situation of the most serious financial difficulties. Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of €17 million on the school transport budget and these measures are an integral part of this.</p>

Unfortunately, an analysis of progress by socio-economic background was not possible due to the four-year gap since the previous census and changes in the under-lying population.  However, a new study of participation in 2010, which will draw on the 2011 census data will be carried out. This will include an update on participation by students in higher education from under-represented socio-economic groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_4885">The NCCA has been asked to review the junior certificate and advise on the scope for reform designed to strengthen literacy and numeracy, embed key skills, promote active learning and enhanced creativity and innovation, and ensure appropriate ways of generating evidence of learning. Concerns have also been raised about curriculum overload, and rote learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_4886">The Council has completed a public consultation process and is finalising its advice to me on the direction of reform, in consultation with the partners in education. I expect the Council's advice in the Autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_4887">I am aware that teachers of history and geography have raised concerns that their subjects will no longer be compulsory. The requirement to study history and geography in a secondary school but to have different options in vocational schools is a historical anomaly which is no longer appropriate. I believe that students should have as wide a choice as is feasible in their schools given the overall level of student demand and interest, the teaching resources available, and the qualifications profile of staff. The importance of history and geography in promoting critical analysis skills, interculturalism, an understanding of human development, democracy, past and current world issues, and the skills for an environmentally sustainable life are fully appreciated. I will be guided by the NCCA's advice in this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_4894">The OECD PISA 2009 Digital Literacy Assessment showed that Irish students' ability to read computer-based text was significantly above the average of the 19 OECD countries that took the test. It is reassuring to see that students in Ireland compare very well with their OECD counterparts in this study but there is no room for complacency about reading standards in our schools. The above-average results of Irish students on the digital literacy tests contrasts with their poor performance in the 2009 round of the traditional pencil-and-paper PISA literacy tests. These results seem to suggest that the reading standards of Irish 15-year olds may be better than the poor results achieved on the traditional pencil-and-paper test in 2009 but not at the above-average levels scored by Irish students in 2000.</p>

It began in 24 project schools in September 2008 and was introduced in all schools in September 2010.  Project Maths provides for a professional development model under which change will be implemented in various areas of maths on a phased basis.  The curriculum will be phased in over a number of years covering the following five strands of mathematics:</p>
            <p eId="para_4899">Phase 1: Strand 1- statistics and probability; Strand 2- geometry and trigonometry</p>
            <p eId="para_4900">Phase 2: Strand 3- number; Strand 4- algebra</p>
            <p eId="para_4901">Phase 3: functions</p>
            <p eId="para_4902">Strands 1 and 2 began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012 at Leaving Certificate and 2013 at Junior Certificate. Strands 3 and 4 will begin in 2011, and strand 5 will start in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4903">A comprehensive programme of professional development is being provided for teachers. Support will be provided on a rolling basis as each strand of the curriculum is implemented, and will continue until at least 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_4946">Changes to the School Transport Schemes, including the ‘Closed School Rule (CSR)', were announced in Budget 2011 and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4947">The change referred to by the Deputy in relation to ceasing the CSR is not scheduled to be introduced until the beginning of the 2012/13 school year.  Pupils commencing their primary education from this date will have their eligibility determined by the distance they reside from their nearest national school, as determined by my Department, having regard to language and ethos.  A sample survey undertaken as part of the Value for Money Review showed that the majority of pupils are in fact attending their nearest open school, so this change will not have any practical impact on these pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_4948">My Department has requested Bus Éireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the "on the ground" impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve.  This analysis will be based on the most up to date information available on current school transport usage patterns and on the final data in relation to school transport requirements in September 2011.

The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) provides financial, insurance and risk analysis advice to State Authorities in order to assist in determining the most appropriate procurement mechanism. I understand that to date in 2011 there are five PPPs at various stages of the procurement process of which the NDFA is acting as the procuring authority for three in the education sector.

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_5162">National competitiveness is a broad concept that encompasses a diverse range of factors, including costs to business, and also policy inputs such as education and training, economic and technological infrastructure, and the taxation and regulatory framework. The Harmonised Competitiveness Indicators provide one measure of our competitiveness trends.</p>
            <p eId="para_5163">The recent report published by the National Competitiveness Council on <i>Costs of Doing Business in Ireland</i>   states that Ireland experienced a significant loss in cost competitiveness as measured by the real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator between 2002 and early 2008.  Since 2008, however, we have regained some of this lost competitiveness and Irish competitiveness is now back to 2003 levels.  This has been driven by favourable exchange rate movements and lower rates of inflation compared with our competitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_5164">Our competitiveness has also been improved through a reduction in the costs of doing business.  Improvements have been seen in relation to labour costs, property costs, utilities and business services, as highlighted by the National Competitiveness Council in their recent report.</p>
            <p eId="para_5165">To continue to build on this improvement in our competitiveness, however, the Government recognises that it must put in place structural reforms to our cost base, to ensure that the gains we make are permanent and will not be eroded by a resumption in growth or exchange rate movements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5166">In this context, I have been in contact with my ministerial colleagues, highlighting the issues which the National Competitiveness Council believes must be addressed to strengthen the competitiveness of our cost base, and asking them to consider those recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5167">As the Deputy will be aware, on 10th May the Government announced the introduction of a range of measures under the Jobs Initiative to improve the competitiveness of the economy, to support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones, and to assist those who are currently unemployed to return to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_5168">Many of these measures have already been brought into effect, including the reduction of VAT on services primarily in the hospitality sector; the halving of the lower rate of employer's PRSI on earnings up to €356 per week; the launch of the National Internship scheme; and the focusing of the State's capital expenditure towards more employment-intensive projects in the areas of education, local and regional roads and sustainable transport projects. My Department is also currently working on developing a Loan Guarantee scheme and a Microfinance Start up Fund, to improve access to finance for businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_5169">I am also continuing to develop proposals for substantial reform of our Sectoral Wage Agreements, as well as working to develop job opportunities in a number of emerging sectors, including Cloud Computing, Digital Gaming, Life Sciences, Medical Devices, Information and Communications Technology, Financial Services, Content Industry, Consumer and Business Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5170">I will continue working with my Government colleagues, through the Cabinet Committee structure, to identify actions that can be taken to improve cost competitiveness in other areas, such as commercial rates, legal costs and administrative burdens. The Government will also in the near future legislate to address the commitment in the Programme for Government to abolish upwards only rent reviews in existing business leases.</p>

            <p eId="para_5175">The role of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is to provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a range of tailored Programmes and Supports in order to fulfil this role.  The overall priorities for Capital expenditure by the CEBs focus on the promotion and stimulation of entrepreneurship at local level and the development of sustainable growth-orientated micro-enterprises, which, over time, can develop into strong export entities.  This is done through the provision of both financial assistance and non-financial assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5176">An annual Exchequer allocation is provided each year for the operation of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs).  The Exchequer allocation is made in the context of the overall public finances and in 2011 amounts to €27.242m, of which €15m in Capital is available for direct grants and training, mentoring and advice services to micro-enterprise clients.  The bulk of the non-capital allocation to each CEB pays the salaries of the Business Advisors and other staff who provide direct advice and mentoring to client companies.  This represents a strong investment in the micro-enterprise sector, notwithstanding the additional level of demand on CEB services generated in the current difficult economic climate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5177">It is a matter in the first instance for individual CEBs to determine how they will use allocated funds.  The CEB Central Coordination Unit (within Enterprise Ireland) works closely with the CEBs throughout the year reviewing individual expenditures to ensure that the funding allocated to the CEBs is utilised to the maximum extent possible.  As part of this process the CCU undertakes a surrenders and reallocation process whereby any potential underspend by a CEB is identified and made available to any CEB that has requested additional funding.  Any monies surrendered are not transferred from one specific CEB to another but are pooled and reallocated as part of an impartial reallocation process.  Some CEBs may not be in a position to spend the totality of their annual allocation when for example an approved grant is decommitted very late in the year in circumstances where the grantee is unable to draw down the grant within the time available.  If this arises in the very limited circumstances where the money cannot be reallocated the money is surrendered to the Exchequer.</p>

            <p eId="para_5674">I have no plans to reconsider the changes to the fuel allowance and household benefits package which were announced last week.  From September 2011 the fuel allowance is to be standardised at €20 per week, the rate currently received by the majority of customers, with no additional allowance for living in a smokeless area.  The cost of the telephone allowance will be reduced following negotiations with Eircom which will ensure that customers receive €26.86 of value on their bills, at a cost to the State of €22.22 per month.  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance will be reduced to the level at the start of 2007 (from 2,400 to 1,800).  These three measures will generate savings of €17 million in 2011 and €65 million annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_5675">While we have had to implement these measures, the House should be aware that these savings were provided for last December in Budget 2011 but were not specified or announced by the Government at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_5676">While of course we want to protect the basic social welfare payments which have very positive economic and social effects, regrettably there is an ongoing necessity to achieve savings due to our commitments with the IMF/EU/ECB Troika.  There will be an ongoing necessity to curtail overall expenditure in 2012 and in later years.  The Comprehensive Review of Expenditure currently underway in all government departments and agencies will form the basis for making the necessary decisions to achieve this.</p>
            <p eId="para_5677">Along with other Departments and agencies, my Department has been working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on an Affordable Energy Strategy and this is expected to be brought to Government in the Autumn.  Energy poverty is a factor of income, energy prices and the thermal efficiency of the home.  The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to reduce their consumption of energy through improving the thermal efficiency of the home.  The SEI has administered an energy efficiency programme for privately owned low income households (Warmer Homes) since 2001.  Over 65,000 such households have benefited to date, with a further 15,000 expected to receive energy efficiency upgrades this year.  A similar upgrade programme is also in place for local authority houses.</p>

            <p eId="para_5679">Qualified adult dependants, aged 25 and over, of eligible persons may avail of the spousal swap option.  This involves the person exchanging his/her FÁS place with his/her dependant with the dependant inheriting the entitlements of the eligible person. Essentially, a person who is offered a position on a relevant FÁS scheme can choose not to avail of it and offer the opportunity instead to their qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant.</p>
            <p eId="para_5680">With respect to a placement on a community employment (CE) scheme, which I understand is involved in this case, the situation arises where a person in receipt of jobseeker's allowance is offered a CE place.

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_5683">I understand that the Deputy's office has confirmed to my office that this question relates solely to the operation of the central Rents Unit in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_5684">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is currently administered on behalf of the Department by the Community Welfare Services division of the Health Service Executive.  Late last year agreement was reached between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and unions representing the Community Welfare Officers that the staff of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) would transfer to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1st January 2011 on a secondment basis initially.  The period of secondment is to last for 9 months until the end of September 2011.  During this period these staff will remain employees of the HSE but are subject to the general direction and control of the Minster for Social Protection. From 1 October 2011 it is intended that the staff of the CWS will be transferred fully to the Department as civil servants and will be accountable to the Minister in the same way as other civil servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5685">Historically rent supplements have been administered locally by the Community Welfare Officer (CWO) directly to the customer.  However, as a result of a large increase in claims being made in recent years and the restriction on staff recruitment in the service, it was decided that priority had to be given to the demand on the local service for claims where an immediate decision was needed such as basic payments and exceptional needs payments.  It was considered that rent supplement claims could be delivered more efficiently through centralised units.  A unit to provide this service was set up on the North side of Dublin in December 2010 to take claims from Balbriggan, Swords and other areas of North Dublin where a large increase in demand for rent supplement had been experienced.  As the Deputy is aware it is a matter for all Departments and public sector organisations to continue to manage services with diminishing resources taking advantage of business re-engineering possibilities as provided for in the Public Service Agreement 2010 — 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_5686">I have been advised that a number of staff in the CWS were employed in a temporary capacity by the HSE in 2010 for a period of six months, including some of the staff in the rent unit in question.  These contracts were subsequently extended to June 2011 from when they are being gradually withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_5687">A number of Transition Managers have been appointed from within the Community Welfare Service, to work with the Department of Social Protection to oversee the transfer of the service to the Department and to manage the day to day administration of the service.  The relevant Transition Managers are currently in the process of examining the service implications arising from the loss of these temporary staff, in particular from the rent units.  They are also examining the model being used to deliver the service to ensure that the most efficient process will be used to improve service delivery.  Further initiatives are also proposed which will result in process improvement with a realignment of resources.  There are no plans at present to allocate additional temporary staff to this unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_5688">To avail of job-bridge, the national internship scheme, applicants must be currently in receipt of certain jobseeker's payments and have been unemployed for a minimum period of 78 days in the preceding six months.  Potential providers of internship (host organisations) approach FÁS who will assess the vacancies to ensure that they are appropriate for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5689">One of the conditions of the national internship scheme is that no vacancies exist in the area in which the internship is being offered as such the positions in question would not qualify for inclusion in the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_5691">The administrative arrangements for the 2011 back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme differ from those that applied in previous years.  For this year, the majority of back to school clothing and footwear allowance entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers.  For some people on the basis of the information available it was not possible to establish entitlement.  These customers are required to complete an application form that is available for download from <i>www.welfare.ie</i> or by texting “Form BTSCFA”, followed by their name and address to 51909.</p>
            <p eId="para_5692">Processing has begun on the manual applications already received and it will take 4-6 weeks to process applications.  In all cases a letter will issue to applicants informing them of the decision and, where payment has been awarded, when and where they can collect the payment.  In the case of refusal of the allowance the procedures for review of the decision will be outlined to customers.</p>

For this year, the majority of back to school clothing and footwear allowance entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers. For some people on the basis of the information available it was not possible to establish entitlement.  These customers are required to complete an application form that is available for download from <i>www.welfare.ie</i> or by texting “Form BTSCFA”, followed by their name and address to 51909.</p>

From time to time An Post has issued instructions reminding their staff of this requirement.

Acceptable forms of identification are a valid Passport, a valid Driving Licence, a Garda National Age Card or a Travel Pass accompanied by Photo ID.  The identification requirements apply equally to those cashing a social welfare cheque as those using the social welfare services card to access their electronic payment.  All claimants, of whatever scheme they are on, may be asked for proof of identification on collection of a payment from a post office, where they are not known to the counter staff.</p>

Registration has commenced and it is expected that cards will begin to issue later this year.  There is no charge to the customer for this card.</p>

This initiative will improve the work readiness of people on the Live Register with a clear focus on providing work placements. The initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and Údarás na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas — referred to as Implementing Bodies. Each Implementing Body has been given an allocation based on the level of persons on the Live Register meeting the criteria for Tús within its area of operation.</p>

Responsibility for promoting, identifying and evaluating suitable work placements rests with each Implementing Body. A central database of organisations applying to offer work placements is not held. I have had enquiries made with the relevant Implementing Bodies and they have indicated that 53 organisations have expressed an interest in providing 96 work placements. The total number of work placements evaluated to date by the Implementing Bodies is 40 with 24 of these ready to receive personnel.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_5786">The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department. A four-pronged control strategy has been adopted by the Department, namely prevention of fraud and error at the initial claim stage, early detection through effective review of claims in payment, measures to deter fraud, and the pursuit and recovery of overpayments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5787">Where overpayments occur, the Department seeks to recover the overpayments in full. In cases of serious fraud, the Department will use all legal avenues open to it to recover the money defrauded.</p>
            <p eId="para_5788">There is no general prohibition on claiming welfare payments where a person has a conviction, even a social welfare conviction. However, if the sentence involves a period in prison, then s/he would not be entitled to claim any welfare payment for the period of imprisonment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5789">Under current social welfare legislation and regulations, the basic rate of subsistence to meet the needs of a person, is the basic Supplementary Welfare rate (SWA). The current weekly rate of SWA is €2 less than most main social welfare payments. Persons who have been found guilty of welfare fraud may receive the basic rate of supplementary welfare, provided they fulfil the statutory conditions in the normal manner. Therefore, in cases where a person has no income other than a social welfare payment, the Department can deduct €2 per week in respect of the overpayment. However, depending on the person's means and circumstances, amounts greater than this can be recovered. The Department makes every effort to recoup overpayments in full from all customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5790">There is legislative provision which allows for the amount of any other social welfare payment that the person could have qualified for during the period in which the overpayment occurred, to be offset against the amount of that overpayment. However, I introduced an amendment in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, which was signed into law last month. legislation to ensure that persons who defraud the social welfare system — and who have an overpayment — do not get the benefit of this "offsetting" arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5791">This new legislative provision ensures that the offsetting of other potential social welfare entitlements during the period in which an overpayment occurred, will only apply to cases where the overpayment did not arise as a result of the person defrauding the social welfare system.</p>

            <p eId="para_5793">There are already adequate safeguards in the social protection system to qualify for a social welfare payment if they are of limited means. Many employees can establish an entitlement to a social insurance payment if they become unemployed on the basis of contributions paid by them and their employer. Employees with children in low-wage employment may qualify for family income supplement. Self-employed workers can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services. In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year. In the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5794">Furthermore, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is the "safety net" within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to any persons in the State , subject to qualifying conditions, whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. SWA provides a minimum weekly allowance to eligible persons who have insufficient means. Those eligible for assistance under the SWA scheme are normally in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment. Certain qualified persons with low incomes may also be entitled to a weekly supplement to meet specific needs such as rent or mortgage interest supplement, diet supplement, heating supplement, or a once off payment to help with the cost of any exceptional needs they may have which they could not reasonably be expected to meet from their own resources. There is also provision for an urgent needs payment whereby someone who is normally excluded from payment of SWA may qualify for a payment (e.g. because of fire or flood).</p>

            <p eId="para_5918">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) provides for a supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is currently administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5919">Each application for mortgage interest supplement is determined by a community welfare officer taking account of the relevant legislative provisions and on the basis of the merits of each individual case. The timescale for determining applications for rent and mortgage interest supplements is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements, information from landlords, lending institutions etc. In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.  Historically rent supplements have been administered locally by the Community Welfare Officer directly to the customer. However, as a result of a large increase in claims being made in recent years and the restriction on staff recruitment in the service, it was decided that priority had to be given to the demand on the local service for claims where an immediate decision was needed   such as basic payments and exceptional needs payments. It was considered that rent and mortgage interest supplement claims could be delivered more efficiently through centralised units.</p>
            <p eId="para_5920">A number of Transition Managers have been appointed from within the Community Welfare Service and are currently examining the models being used to deliver rent and mortgage interest supplement claims to ensure that the most efficient process is used with a view to improving service delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_5921">The provision of a prompt service is a major objective; however this has to be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the demands of natural justice and the need to ensure that every case is fully investigated. While certain cases may take more time to process than others, overall, the Department is satisfied that the CWS makes every effort to decide rent and mortgage interest supplement claims in an efficient, effective and timely manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_5923">In the UK the Habitual Residence Test (HRT) is a two stage test, the first part being a test of the right to reside in the UK or other part of the Common Travel Area (which includes the UK, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, and the Republic of Ireland) and the second part being a test of habitual residence in the place where right of residence is held.  The first part of the test is applied to everyone who claims Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance (Income Based), State Pension Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_5924">The second part of the test (actual habitual residence) is only applied to people who have a right to reside and who have arrived or returned to live in the UK within 2 years of claiming these benefits.  People who demonstrate a right to reside but who have been in the UK for more than 2 years are not subject to the second part of the test. Habitual residence is not defined in UK law and each case must be considered on its own merits.  When applying the second part of the test decision makers take into account various factors including reasons for going to the UK, any previous work in the UK and intention to remain.</p>
            <p eId="para_5925">An Irish national (or passport holder) returning to the UK, or going to the UK for the first time has a right to reside in the Common Travel Area (CTA).

            <p eId="para_5926">It is understood that the EU Commission is considering a challenge to the manner in which the UK condition is applied, with particular reference to the right to reside condition.</p>

         when it is likely that all appeals pending can be determined within a reasonable time, with particular reference to those on appeal in respect of carer’s allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_5928">I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the number of appeals waiting to be processed at present is 19,525 (a reduction of some 1,500 since July 2010), of which 1,681 refer to carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5929">These figures must be seen against a background where there has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 32,432 in 2010.  Current indications are that, while there now appears to be a slight drop in the number of appeals being received in 2011, the annual intake is still likely to be close to 30,000 for the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5930">In an effort to reduce the backlog of appeals, the Department has made 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.  These assignments will augment the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29.  In addition, since July 2010, 8 retired Appeals Officers, equating to a further 3 full-time officers, have been assisting on a strictly part-time basis with the backlogs of appeals and it is intended that they will be employed until the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5931">Some 3,000 cases, registered prior to 31/12/10, have been ring-fenced and a team of 10 of the Office's most experienced Appeals Officers have been freed from all other work in the Office and will concentrate on clearing this backlog.  This project commenced on July 1st.</p>
            <p eId="para_5932">In addition to these measures, more emphasis is now placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity.  As a result, the number of appeals dealt with by way of oral hearing was reduced from 42% for the first 6 months of 2010 to just over 30% for the same period in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_5933">As a result of the various initiatives taken, 10,540 decisions were made by Appeals Officers in the first six months of 2011, in comparison to 6,043 for the same period in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5934">Overall, it is expected that the increase in the number of decisions being made by Appeals Officers will continue and this, combined with the slight reduction in the numbers received should lead to on-going reductions in the backlog of appeals.</p>

The use of PIN numbers for access to handsets and voicemail, and, in some instances, encryption of messages, allows users to protect information stored on their phones, such as SMS messages and emails, as well as enabling them to protect personal information, such as voicemails, stored on the telecommunications network.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_5963">I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 to 210, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5964">I announced the launch of <i> </i>Better Energy: the National Upgrade Programme, in early May in the context of the Government’s Jobs Initiative.  Better Energy Homes<i> </i>replaces the three existing energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes: the Home Energy Savings Scheme (HES), the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) and the Greener Homes Scheme (GHS).</p>
            <p eId="para_5965">The Better Energy grant levels have been set to ensure that the level of Exchequer support is in line with market prices.  The grant levels represent approximately 30% of the cost of each efficiency measure supported under the Programme.  Since the GHS and HES schemes were launched in 2006 and 2009, respectively, there have been substantial reductions in the prices being charged for most of the measures covered by the schemes, the exception being external insulation, which is a relatively new technology in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_5966">Measures supported under Better Energy Programme are those designed to deliver the greatest energy savings, thus maximising the value achieved from the Exchequer allocation.  The measures grant-aided under this strand include roof and wall insulation, high efficiency boilers, heating control upgrades and solar thermal. Full details of the grant amounts are contained in the following table.</p>
            <p eId="para_5967">The Better Energy Homes solar grant is €800 for every eligible home where the installation of the system meets the installation requirements as set out in the Code of Practice, which is itself aligned with the current Building Regulations in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5968">The previous renewable energy grant programme, Greener Homes, provided a pro rata grant based on the area and type of panel installed.  Better Energy targets the improvement of the energy efficiency of the housing stock.  By setting a performance standard for the solar thermal panel, the grant is appropriately linked to the relevant renewable contribution from the installation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5969">Support for biomass and wood pellet burners through the Greener Homes Scheme was designed to develop a mature and functioning market, which is now in place.  Having achieved its objectives wood pellet, wood gasification and heat pump technologies are no longer grant aided and the Scheme has now closed.  Since the launch of the Greener Homes Scheme, funding of over €72m has been provided towards the installation of over 33,000 renewable energy heating systems.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_5991">I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 to 213, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5992">Ireland is obliged under the EU Renewable Energy Directive to achieve a binding target of 16% of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020, a five fold increase on 2005.  As set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), the bulk of Ireland's target will be met by the electricity sector. 40% of electricity consumption will come from renewable sources by 2020, and 36% of this will be from wind — the highest proportion in any Member State of the EU.  While we have made excellent progress in the electricity sector in recent years, achieving a threefold increase in our electricity consumption from wind over the course of this decade will be challenging.</p>
            <p eId="para_5993">It is important to maintain a stable and predictable policy framework with respect to the support schemes for renewable energy and apply a cautious approach when considering measures affecting existing investments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5994">My Department has applied for State Aid clearance to continue to offer REFIT for Gate 3 projects.  This application is currently with the European Commission for decision. REFIT operates by providing developers with a guaranteed floor price over a 15-year period.  The scheme design was deemed necessary to incentivise sufficient new renewable development.  Prior to finalisation of the new REFIT scheme I will be reviewing the arrangements comprehensively with my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5995">Financial institutions are unlikely to be willing to lend substantial amounts to developers to construct new renewable projects if a minimum price cannot be guaranteed, with significant negative implications for project build out, and ultimately for the achievement of our binding EU 2020 renewable targets and to ensure security of supply, improved diversity of energy sources and lower dependence on imported fossil fuels and their price volatility.</p>
            <p eId="para_5996">In January 2009, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation (NIAER) published a study entitled "Impact of High Levels of Wind Penetration in 2020 on the Single Electricity Market (SEM)". The study finds that increasing the level of wind generation on the Irish electricity system may have significant benefits for Irish energy consumers, as well as environmental and economic benefits.  One of the findings of the study is that the design of the Single Electricity Market (SEM) in Ireland is robust enough to allow for the entry of a significant amount of new wind generation in the coming years.  In that context it is for the SEM Committee to address in its market rules the challenge of ensuring that all generators are reasonably and fairly remunerated in the market while ensuring the most economic prices possible for electricity consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5997">In Feb 2011, EirGrid and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland published a study entitled "Impact of Wind Generation on Wholesale Electricity Costs in 2011".  Key Messages from that study show that the wind generation expected in 2011 will reduce Ireland's wholesale market cost of electricity by around €74 million.  This reduction in the wholesale market cost of electricity is approximately equivalent to the sum of Public Service Obligation (PSO) costs, estimated as €50 million, and the increased constraint costs incurred, due to wind in 2011.  The total cost of generation is the sum of the wholesale cost of electricity, the PSO cost of wind and the dispatch constraint costs.  The total cost does not increase with the inclusion of the 2011 wind capacity.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_5999">Enhancing the energy efficiency of low-income homes through structural improvements remains the most effective means of reducing energy poverty.  To date, energy efficiency improvements in over 65,000 homes have been made under the Better Energy: Warmer Homes programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6000">Better Energy: Warmer Homes provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, energy poverty and is primarily delivered by 28 community based organisations (CBOs).  The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.  Private contractors are also engaged to address areas or technologies not covered by CBOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6001">There are two predominant methods of measuring the number of households in energy poverty — the expenditure method and the subjective method.  Using the expenditure method, estimates suggest that 301,368 or 19.4% of Irish households may have experienced fuel poverty in 2008.  Alternatively, using the subjective method 127,984 households reported that they either couldn't afford to heat their home properly or had to go without heating at some stage in 2008. It is important to note that neither method fully captures the relationship between energy prices, income and the thermal efficiency of the dwelling. As a result, both methods should be considered to only provide a useful indicator of the number of households in energy poverty rather than an exact picture. This matter is addressed in detail in the forthcoming affordable energy strategy.</p>

         if concerns have been raised with him over ComReg’s proposal to turn off the 900 MHz GSM voice and text service frequency in 2013; the way it will be replaced; when the regulatory process for the new mobile spectrum will begin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6003">In accordance with its statutory function under the 2002 and its obligations under EU law, ComReg assigns rights of use for spectrum by way of a licence under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_6004">Currently, the 900 MHz frequency spectrum is used to provide GSM (2G) voice and text services in Ireland.  New technological developments now allow for innovative broadband services to also be provided in the 900 MHz band.  This band is particularly valuable as it covers greater distances than higher frequency bands, allowing modern voice, data and multimedia services to be extended into less populated and rural areas.  The provision of voice, data and broadband services are not mutually exclusive and it is anticipated that liberalizing the band will provide a wider range of services for consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6005">In 2009 the EU GSM Directive was adopted to allow the use of this band for electronic communications services additional to GSM.  The objective is to allow a wider choice of services and technologies to consumers and to maximise competition in the bands so far covered by the Directive, while ensuring that services remain coordinated.</p>
            <p eId="para_6006">ComReg has responsibility for the operation and management of spectrum and is independent in its functions.  ComReg has consulted openly on its proposal to liberalise and assign rights of use in the 900 MHz band together with the 800 and 1800 MHz bands from January 2013.  These public consultations have been ongoing since July 2008 on this important matter.  ComReg proposes to assign the rights of usage in this band by way of an auction later in 2011.  The process aims to open the band for provision of significantly enhanced mobile broadband services which will deliver tangible benefits for consumers and business.  ComReg is not proposing any switch off of voice services in the 900MHz band.</p>

            <p eId="para_6009">The Group has developed a digital switchover programme to ensure TV viewers are given the options, information and advice to switch from the analogue terrestrial TV network to a digital TV network or pay TV service, by the date of closure of the analogue TV network in Q4 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_6010">RTÉ has built, owns and controls the new national digital TV network which they call Saorview.  The RTÉ Saorview digital TV network was launched nationally on 26th May 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_6014">Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities with powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise from any premises, processes and works.  The Environment Section of the relevant City or County Council is the appropriate contact point for reporting a noise nuisance in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_6015">In addition, under section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, where any noise is so loud, so continuous, so repeated, of such duration or pitch or occurring at such times as to give reasonable cause for annoyance, then it is open to any person, or group of persons, to bring a complaint to the District Court.  The Court may order the person or body making, causing or responsible for the noise to take the measures necessary to reduce the noise to a specified level or to take specified measures for the prevention or limitation of the noise and the person or body concerned must comply with that order.</p>

            <p eId="para_6019">A judgment of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Case C-66/06 on 20 November 2008 found that Ireland's system of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) screening for certain categories of agriculture related projects was over-reliant on size thresholds and did not take other relevant criteria (e.g. cumulative impacts of development, location relative to sensitive sites etc.) into account, and that Ireland was therefore in breach of its obligations under the EIA Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_6020">The relevant project categories are: (a) projects for the restructuring of rural land holdings (1(a) of Annex II); (b) the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agricultural purposes, (1(b) of Annex II); and (c) water management projects for agriculture, including irrigation and land drainage projects (1(c) of Annex II).</p>
            <p eId="para_6021">In preparing its response to this issue, my Department undertook extensive consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Following this collaboration, it was agreed that it would be more appropriate that most of these types of activities — essentially removal of field boundaries, converting semi-natural areas to intensive agriculture and general field drainage works — would be regulated by that Department.  Accordingly, it was decided that only development involving the drainage or reclamation of wetlands would be retained in the planning system.</p>
            <p eId="para_6022">My Department has produced Regulations which reduce the threshold for mandatory environmental impact assessment of drainage/reclamation of wetlands from 20 hectares to 2 hectares, and reduce the threshold above which a planning application is required to 0.1 hectares.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011 were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 23 June 2011, and referred to the Joint Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht for consideration.  The Committee discussed the Regulations at their meeting of Thursday 14 July, and referred them back to the Houses for approval.  It is expected that the Regulations will receive the positive approval of both Houses on 20 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_6023">The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is currently preparing Regulations to implement a screening and consent system in relation to the other activities the subject of the judgment, which will therefore be exempted from the requirement to obtain planning permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_6024">It is intended that both sets of Regulations will be signed shortly and that Guidance on the implementation of the Regulations will be issued at the same time by the two Departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_6034">The legal requirements for the design and construction of new buildings are set out in twelve parts (classified as Parts A to M) of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations.  Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each part in order to demonstrate how compliance with the legal requirements can be achieved in practice.   The onus is on the owner and the builder to ensure that all works undertaken are fully compliant with the relevant parts of the Building Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6035">The key legal requirements relevant to the prevention of the use pyritic material in housing developments are set out in Parts D (Materials and Workmanship) and C (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6036">Requirement D1 specifies that "All works to which these Regulations apply shall be carried out with proper materials and in a workmanlike manner".  Requirement D3 defines "Proper Materials" as "materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used".   It is worth noting that the legal requirements outlined in Part D were applied in the judgement of the High Court delivered on 25 May 2011 in the case of James Elliot Construction Limited -v- Irish Asphalt Limited which found Irish Asphalt Limited liable on all counts for the supply of defective pyritic material.  This demonstrates that the legal requirements outlined in Part D are relevant and enforceable where the use of defective pyritic materials in buildings is found to have occurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_6037">As mentioned in response to previous questions, most recently Question No. 91 of 19 May 2011, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), following an intervention from my Department, published a new amended Standard Recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work.  The new Standard Recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and it addresses the quality standards of new homes and buildings insofar as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.   TGD C (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) was amended to incorporate the revised NSAI Standard Recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6038">The Building Regulations are kept under ongoing review by my Department in conjunction with the Building Regulations Advisory Body.  All proposals for new or amended requirements undergo a rigorous technical analysis and are subject to a comprehensive public consultation process, which includes the completion of a full Regulatory Impact Assessment, before they are signed into law.</p>

            <p eId="para_6069">The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981.</p>
            <p eId="para_6070">My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and emergency equipment as well as construction and upgrading of fire stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6071">Donegal County Council, in partnership with my Department, has made substantial progress in modernising fire stations in Co Donegal and has replaced 12 fire stations following investment of some €11 million by my Department over the last decade. The following towns in County Donegal are now served by new fire stations: Milford (1998); Buncrana (2000); Letterkenny (HQ) and An Fál Carrach (both in 2003); Carndonagh and Donegal town (both in 2004); Killybegs (2005); An Clochán Liath, Glenties and Moville (all three in 2007); and most recently Gaoth Dobhair and Stranorlar (2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_6072">Given the current constraints on public finances, continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as the priority measure in the fire services capital programme at this time. In that context, I recently approved a new programme of joint procurement of 17 fire appliances.  Further support from my Department to Donegal County Council under the fire services capital programme in the period ahead, including the provision of a replacement fire station in Gleann Colm Cille, will have regard to the Council's priorities, the extent of previous investment, the value for money offered by proposals, the spread of existing facilities and the totality of demands from fire authorities countrywide.</p>

         further to Parliamentary Question No. 211 of 31 May 2011 and No. 283 of 7 June 2011, his views on an amendment to the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 to enable the publication of those convicted of litter offences; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in the case of tax defaulters, specific provision was made in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to allow the publication of the names of such defaulters instead of a more general amendment of the Data Protection Acts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6074">I am examining means to improve Ireland's response to the problem of littering and "naming and shaming" will be one of the aspects I will be considering.   However, a new specific provision to amend the Litter Pollution Acts to enable the publication of those convicted of litter offences would require the necessary consultative procedures associated with primary legislation.  Furthermore, great care would have to be taken to ensure that any such provision would not be in breach of the principles of data protection.</p>

Work is also underway on the development of a cost-benefit analysis of the various options for the metering programme. Further details will be announced following the Government's consideration of the proposals.

        <b> Deputy Catherine Murphy</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</b>
         the home adaptation and essential repairs grant allocations that were made by local authorities, in 2010 and 2011; if the absence of matching funds is impeding drawdown of these grants; if so, the location of same; if any local authorities have indicated a need for additional resources to administer the grant system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Willie Penrose)</from>
            <p eId="para_6353">The Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, introduced in November 2007, replaced the discontinued Disabled Persons Grant Scheme, the Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme, administered by the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_6354">The grant schemes are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority. It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed to each of the various grant measures, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.  Exchequer funding amounting to €78.7m was allocated and recouped to local authorities in respect of the grant schemes in 2010.   Allocations totalling almost €64m were notified to local authorities under the grant schemes on 17 February 2011. To date some €18.3m, amounting to 29% of the Exchequer funding, has been drawn down by the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_6355">My Department is aware that these schemes are very heavily subscribed and available funding has been committed in many areas.  My Department is also aware of the financial constraints on local authority own resources funding at this time and, in order to relieve the pressure on revenue funding, agreed to allow authorities to use internal capital receipts to boost the revenue funding available for supporting the grant schemes in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_6356">The allocations to local authorities for 2010 and 2011 are set out in the following table:</p>

            <p eId="para_6566">The County and City Managers' Association (CCMA) is the representative body for senior Managers in Irish Local Government.  The Association meets to discuss common areas of concern and promote a cohesive approach from the local authority system to issues of relevance and importance including development of best practice, implementation of legislation, and general operational issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_6567">The CCMA operates through a number of committees, each of which is concerned with a specific policy area and these committees interact with relevant Government departments and agencies on a structured basis. The CCMA is affiliated to and represented on many national and international bodies. The Office for Local Authority Management (OLAM), under the remit of the Local Government Management Services Board, was established to assist in the provision of management services to local authorities. The Office for Local Authority Management provides a range of services which include providing administrative services to the CCMA.</p>
            <p eId="para_6568">In accordance with Article 5 (20) of the Local Government Management Services Board (Establishment) Order, 1996 the expenses of the Board are recouped from local authorities. The cost of financing OLAM is €298,559 annually.  There is no grant paid to the Association by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_6570">The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides for a new process of housing needs assessment for applicants for social housing support and empowers the Minister to make regulations setting out the criteria for determining the eligibility for such support.  These criteria include, but are not limited to, income levels and the availability of alternative accommodation.  Amended regulations have now been made under the Act to include the unsustainability of a household's current accommodation under the terms of the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears 2011 as being amongst the criteria to be taken into consideration in assessing need.  The amending regulations came into effect on 1 July 2011.  The same income thresholds will be in place for households who have voluntarily surrendered their homes or had their homes repossessed as all others being assessed for social housing support.</p>

            <p eId="para_6572">My Department's voluntary and co-operative housing programme is supported through two funding schemes, the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) and the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS). The administration of both schemes is devolved to the local authority concerned, which assesses and approves each proposal prior to submission to my Department.  In the case of the CAS, which provides capital funding to approved housing bodies for the provision of accommodation for people with specific categories of need including the homeless, older people and persons with an intellectual, physical or mental health disability, a total of €114 million was recouped to voluntary bodies in 2010.  Due to the current level of commitments and having regard to available funding, new projects proposed under CAS will only be considered in the event of a new call for proposals.  A decision on whether a call for proposals will issue in 2011 will be made later this year, having regard to funding considerations in future years.  In the case of the CLSS, which provides funding for family-type accommodation, €61.3 million was recouped to voluntary bodies in 2010.  CLSS is being wound down, with no further projects being considered, and allocated funding must be claimed and drawn down by the end of 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_6574">My Department gathers aggregate data on enforcement activity from planning authorities, including data on the number of enforcement notices issued under sections 154 and 155 of the Planning Act and the number of prosecutions initiated on foot of these enforcement notices.  The most recently available data are published in the 2009 Annual Planning Statistics, which are available on my Department's website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.  It is the responsibility of planning authorities to provide for proper enforcement of planning control and to take all appropriate steps to ensure development takes place in compliance with national and EU law.  Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  A planning authority may issue an enforcement notice, non-compliance with which is an offence, in connection with unauthorised development, which includes failure to comply with planning conditions, requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period.  If an enforcement notice is not complied with, the planning authority may take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may also seek a court order requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.  The Planning Acts also place clear statutory obligations on planning authorities in relation to unauthorised development.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development).  The planning authority must then carry out an investigation.  Where it establishes, following such an investigation, that unauthorised development has been or is being carried out and the person who has carried out or is carrying out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or make an application for a court order unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.</p>

            <p eId="para_6578">The National Housing Development Survey database, published in October 2010, established an authoritative baseline analysis of unfinished housing developments to assist in fully understanding the scale and extent of the issues involved.  A total of 2,846 developments were inspected where construction had commenced but had not been completed, and these included over 180,000 housing units with planning permission.  Of these, some 120,000 have begun or progressed through construction, while work has yet to commence on 60,000.  Of the 120,000 dwellings, some 77,000 are complete and occupied, 23,000 are complete and vacant, 10,000 are near complete and a further<b> </b>10,000 dwellings are at various early stages of construction activity.  The content of the baseline National Housing Development Survey database is available in tabular form on a county by county basis, together with the methodology employed in conducting the survey, on my Department’s website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_6579">My Department introduced the Unfinished Housing Developments Safety Initiative to deal with the health and safety issues in unfinished estates where the means to make them safe are otherwise unavailable.  Some €5 million has been allocated for this purpose.  Local authorities have identified 238 estates nationally where funding for this purpose is required.  Applications have been received in respect of 146 estates with the balance of applications expected shortly.  My Department has sanctioned works to the value of €1.4 million so far and the initiative is receiving the highest priority.  A list of the developments in respect of which applications for funding have been received is provided in the following table:</p>

            <p eId="para_7021">Under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 2001, local authorities are deemed to be burial boards for their respective functional areas. Acting in their capacity as burial boards, local authorities are responsible for the management, regulation and control of burial grounds in their functional area. With the coming into effect of the Local Government Act 1994 Ministerial consent for the use of land as a burial ground is no longer required. Therefore, ensuring the adequate provision of burial facilities, in their functional areas, is entirely a matter for the relevant local authority.</p>

However during consultations between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General on the implementation of section 22, the Attorney General's office expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of possession of a labelled container by an under-18 year old. For example, the container might have been taken from the home by the underage person, or legally sold to a person over 18 years and passed on to the underage person. This has cast serious doubt on the benefits to be gained from any regulations that might be made under section 22.</p>

            <p eId="para_7132">The first named person concerned arrived in the State on 27th November, 2001 and had permission to remain in the State until 24th May, 2002, on student conditions.  He has remained in the State since that date without permission.  The second named person concerned arrived in the State on 10th April, 2002 and had permission to remain in the State until 9th October, 2002, also on student conditions.  She has remained in the State since that date without permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_7133">Consequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), they were each separately notified, he by letter dated 3rd June, 2010 and she by letter dated 8th June, 2010, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should not have a Deportation Order made against them.</p>
            <p eId="para_7134">Representations have been received on behalf of both of the persons concerned. All representations submitted will be fully considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement before the files are passed to me for decision.  Once decisions have been made, these decisions and the consequences of the decisions will be conveyed in writing to the persons concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_7135">It is noted that the address supplied in the Deputy's Question does not match the address currently on record in my Department for the persons concerned. As it is incumbent on an applicant to notify my Department when they change address, the persons concerned should notify my Department of their up to date address without further delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_7136">I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</p>

I am confident that sufficient resources are available to An Garda Síochána to carry out such investigations.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_7140">I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the organisation to which the Deputy refers is a registered organisation with the Vetting Unit for the purposes of employment vetting.  I recognise that it is important to process these applications within a reasonable time frame both for the benefit of the applicants and the organisations involved.  I am determined to address this aspect of the Garda vetting process.</p>
            <p eId="para_7141">A number of immediate measures are being taken to improve the situation.  The sanction of the Department of Finance has been obtained to retain the services of ten temporary employees in the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU).  A further sanction has been obtained to engage an additional ten temporary employees for the Unit and the process of recruiting these is underway.  This should have an impact on processing times.  In addition, further steps are under consideration with a view to alleviating the pressure on the staff of the GCVU and to reduce the time taken for the processing of applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_7142">The average processing time for vetting applications fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand.  In processing an individual vetting application, additional time may be required in cases where clarification is needed as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out what are very necessary checks. I am informed by the Garda Authorities that, at present, the average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 10 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_7143">I am informed by the Garda Authorities that at present there is a total of five Gardaí, 76 full-time Garda civilian personnel and ten temporary civilian personnel assigned to the GCVU.  This represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.  The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives from around 188,000 in 2007 to almost 292,000 in 2010.  At present, there are approximately 55,000 applications in the course of being processed.</p>

            <p eId="para_7145">I understand that the Deputy is referring to the legislation to provide for the establishment of a DNA Database for criminal investigation purposes, a commitment of the Programme for Government.  Work is progressing on the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill with a target of publishing it before the end of this year. The Bill will facilitate the setting up of a DNA database and the taking of samples from a range of persons including those detained in connection with serious offences, certain prisoners and persons who are subject to the sex offender registration requirements. The Bill will also include appropriate safeguards in relation to the taking and retention of samples and the operation of the database.</p>
            <p eId="para_7146">My proposals will build on the 2010 Bill which lapsed on the dissolution of the last Dáil but will include more comprehensive provision in, for example, the area of co-operation with other States. I have long been an advocate for the establishment of a DNA Database and I am committed to the speedy enactment of the legislation following its publication.</p>

Following receipt of legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, I will review the legislative changes that are proposed and consider bringing them to Government for approval.  It is important to note that whatever changes may be made to the 1939 Order, a comprehensive review of all Red Cross legislation, and in particular the primary legislation, will be commenced by my Department in accordance with the Programme for Government.  In this regard, I believe that an overriding principle should be to ensure that whatever legislative changes are made have the full support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</p>

            <p eId="para_7238">The EU Directive referred to is the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive, 85/337/EEC (as amended).  The primary objective of the EIA Directive is to ensure that projects which are likely to have significant effects on the environment are subject to a prior assessment of their likely impacts before a decision is taken as to whether consent is granted to proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_7239">The European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued a judgement against Ireland on the 20th November 2008.  The Court found that Ireland, in relation to the specific projects the subject of the judgment, was overly reliant on size thresholds to determine if an EIA is required and did not take sufficient account of the nature, location and cumulative effect, etc. of projects.  The action related to three categories of activities, restructuring of rural land holdings, (removing hedgerows or re-contouring land), the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture and water management projects for agriculture, including irrigation and land drainage.</p>
            <p eId="para_7240">The European Commission, on 1 June 2011, formally lodged an application with the ECJ to initiate second proceedings against Ireland for failing to implement the ECJ ruling.  The Commission is requesting the ECJ to impose lump-sum and daily penalty fines on Ireland until the infringement ends.</p>
            <p eId="para_7241">The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and my Department have agreed that two sets of Regulations will be introduced to address the judgement.  It was considered that, with the exception of drainage/reclamation of wetlands, all of the other activities are more appropriate outside of the planning system, and that legislation should be introduced by my Department that would provide a more accessible and timely screening and consent process for farmers.  Therefore, these elements have been removed from the planning system by exemption and will now be included in my Department's Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_7242">The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government has brought draft regulations to the Oireachtas for approval. These Regulations amend the EIA and planning exempted development thresholds for drainage/reclamations of wetlands.  A Joint Oireachtas Committee meeting of the Transport, Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht was held on Thursday 14 July 2011 to discuss the draft Regulations.</p>

The POs play a vital role in supporting Irish producers of fruit and vegetables.

            <p eId="para_7314">My reply of 14 July, 2011 sets out the procedures that are followed in relation to changes to a herdnumber.</p>
            <p eId="para_7315">On 9 December 2009 a copy of the death certificate of the person in whose name the herdnumber was registered was received by my Department.  In accordance with standard procedures in such circumstances, the herdowner was then registered under personal representatives of the deceased person.  An application was received on 4 January 2010 from the personal representatives of the deceased person to register details of the herdnumber in the name of the son of the deceased person.  The application was accompanied by a copy of Probate of the Will of the deceased person, indicating that the son was the executor and sole beneficiary of the Estate.  Following an on-farm inspection on 27 January 2010, it was decided that no change in registration of the herdnumber should take place pending clarification of the issue of ownership of the land and or cattle thereon.  In the meantime, the herd keeper role, which assigns responsibility for the care and maintenance of the cattle to a nominated person, was assigned to the son of the deceased person in whose name the request for transfer of the herdnumber had been received.  An on-farm inspection was carried out by the DVO on 27 January 2010 and all of the cattle present on the holding were inspected and found to be in order.

            <p eId="para_7316">With regard to entitlements to certain farm payments, under EU Regulations governing the Single Payment scheme, entitlements are not attached to land and do not transfer automatically with land.  Entitlements form an independent asset that is owned by a specified person and, upon the death of that person, is governed by normal testamentary procedure.  In accordance with the will of the deceased person, the son was the executor and sole beneficiary of the Estate.  Therefore he became the beneficiary of these entitlements which he subsequently sold to third parties from 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_7317">With regard to Suckler cow and Disadvantaged Area payments, any payments due under these schemes issued into the bank account of the deceased person and hence the normal testamentary procedure regarding execution of the will and her estate would have applied to those payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_7318">On 5 May 2011 an application for registration as a herdowner was received from the daughter of the deceased person.  Evidence of ownership of land accompanied this application.  This application is currently under consideration and it is anticipated that a decision will be made in regard to that application in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_7363">The HSE plan implementing the changes to the Accident and Emergency Services at Roscommon County Hospital came into effect on 11 July.  This saw the establishment of an Urgent Care Centre in place of the Accident and Emergency Department. Persons with acute or life threatening conditions such as heart attacks are being brought by ambulance to larger hospitals, such as Galway, with higher volumes of patients and better outcomes for such conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_7364">The Urgent Care Centre operates from 8am to 8pm seven days a week and is provided by Non Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs) with clinical governance provided by an Emergency Medicine Consultant at Galway. As part of the transitional arrangements for a four week period, an NCHD is also available at the Urgent Care Centre from 8pm to 8am supervised by an on call consultant.</p>
            <p eId="para_7365">An enhanced ambulance service has been put in place.  During the day four ambulances staffed by paramedics are available while three are available at night.  In addition there is a special Rapid Response Vehicle, staffed by an Advanced Paramedic on a 24/7 basis.  An out of hours GP service is also in operation.  A Medical Assessment Unit is open from 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday.  This is a medical admission pathway and accepts referrals from a range of sources, including General Practioners.  I was briefed on the plan by the HSE in advance of its implementation.  The plan was necessitated by the serious patient safety concerns of the HSE and of the Health Information and Quality Authority in relation to the accident and emergency service  at Roscommon following the publication of the Authority's  Report on Mallow.  This was compounded because of NCHD recruitment difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_7366">Roscommon Hospital has a clear future, and will continue to provide key services to the people of the area.  I am committed to the expansion of appropriate services like diagnostics at the hospital.  I have asked the HSE to develop proposals in this regard as quickly as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_7379">I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 and 321 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7380">The HSE's National Clinical Programme for Diabetes — which includes the care of children and adolescents with diabetes, has estimated that there are between 3,000 and 4,000 children and young adults with diabetes in this country.  It was established by the HSE in 2010 with the express aim of defining the way diabetic clinical services should be delivered, resourced and measured.  One of the key priorities is to facilitate future organised care and screening for diabetes related complications.</p>
            <p eId="para_7381">Type 1 diabetes is a particularly complex condition in children and young adults and so it is recommended that their care be delivered in a multidisciplinary setting with access to a consultant paediatric endocrinologist and other diabetes healthcare specialists.</p>
            <p eId="para_7382">One proposed national model of diabetes care is based on 8-10 regional networks, with the 3 existing Dublin centres acting as a tertiary hub of excellence and continuing to see one third of the national paediatric/adolescent diabetes population.  This model has been proposed by the Diabetes Federation of Ireland.  The second model came from the Expert Advisory Group, chaired by Dr Colm Costigan, Paediatric Endocrinologist in Crumlin Hospital.  This proposes that care be centralised for each region in a dedicated paediatric/adolescent diabetes centre looking after at least 150 children/adolescents.  Ideally the centre should be in a regional hospital that has an adult diabetes centre to facilitate transition to adulthood.</p>
            <p eId="para_7383">The national clinical leads for diabetes and paediatrics are to meet in the next couple of weeks to assess current services across the country; to agree a model of care; and to standardise these across the country.  They will also develop criteria for use of CSII therapy (insulin infusion) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and work on policy to prevent and aid the early detection of diabetes in young children and adolescents.</p>
            <p eId="para_7384">Ultimately, the function of the HSE National Programme for diabetes, among others, is to consider which model is most appropriate and it is working to this end. In parallel, my Department and the HSE will be meeting the Diabetes Federation of Ireland with a view to progressing the issues around the appropriate model of care for children and adolescents with diabetes.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_7399">I propose to take Questions Nos. 309 and 310 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7400">In relation to the provision of hospital services generally, I have instructed the HSE not to withdraw any services from acute hospitals unless and until I receive a full briefing on the details of what is proposed, the alternative arrangements to be put in place, and the overall implications for patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_7401">The National Acute Medicine Programme provides a framework for the delivery of acute medical services in hospitals.  It seeks to substantially improve and standardise the care of acutely ill medical patients.  The programme has been jointly developed by the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, to enable the hospital structure to meet present day needs in appropriate settings, thereby providing optimal care for patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_7402">The classification of individual hospitals will determine the type of treatment they may offer.  It will be based on a range of parameters, including the type and level of complexity of treatment that can be performed safely.  This in turn will be determined by factors such as volume of treatment carried out and the complementary specialties, back-up services and range of clinical skills available.  The programme will set out how hospitals operate.  In particular it will allow smaller hospitals to increase activity in areas such as day surgery, minor injuries, outpatients, rehabilitation and diagnostics, which are growth areas for healthcare both nationally and internationally.  I believe that smaller hospitals can and should provide as wide a possible range of services, close to the local community provided they are safe.  I intend to prepare a framework for the development of smaller hospitals, which will set out how they will develop to reach their full true potential.  This will specify what services are transferring to them, from the larger hospitals.  Too often we have focused on what we are taking away rather than what we can add to services there.</p>
            <p eId="para_7403">All of this will be done with full regard to the safety issues highlighted by HIQA, in its reports on Ennis and Mallow Hospitals.  When implemented, smaller hospitals will have vibrant role, doing more work — not less — and meeting as many as possible of the needs of their local community.</p>

            <p eId="para_7405">The configuration of services is constantly being reviewed and reorganised in the light of the clinical programmes currently being developed and rolled out by the HSE and in order to ensure the delivery of appropriate and safe health services.  In all cases the future configuration of services will also need to meet the requirements of the recent HIQA reports on Mallow and Ennis.</p>
            <p eId="para_7406">The models described in the HSE's clinical programmes give guidance as to the appropriate role of hospitals and how they should interact for maximum effectiveness and best patient outcomes.  No decision as to the exact role of any hospital, including Portlaoise Hospital, has yet been taken in terms of the clinical programme models .</p>
            <p eId="para_7407">I will be considering these matters in conjunction with the HSE and relevant experts and will arrive at my decisions in this regard based on the need to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients and the need to ensure safe delivery of health services in hospitals.  As I have stated on several previous occasions, this Government is committed to developing and enhancing the role of  smaller hospitals to ensure that their services can be put to best use for patients and local communities.  I must reiterate, however, that the issue of safe delivery of health services for patients is paramount.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_7432">I propose to take Questions Nos. 323 to 326, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7433">I announced the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) on 1 June. This has been one of my key priorities since becoming Minister for Health. The SDU is a key part of the Government's plans to radically reform the health system in Ireland, with the ultimate goal of introducing a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI).</p>
            <p eId="para_7434">I have appointed Dr Martin Connor as the head of the SDU. Dr Connor is an international expert, with a proven track record in health service transformation. He has extensive experience in the NHS and led a similar initiative in Northern Ireland with considerable success.  His principal task will be to build up the SDU and to prepare proposals for me on how best it can be placed on a permanent footing within the next six months.</p>
            <p eId="para_7435">The SDU will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU will work closely with the HSE, building on initiatives already underway including the clinical programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_7436">The SDU's priorities will encompass:</p>
            <p eId="para_7437">emergency departments — waiting times for admission have been unacceptably high in a number of hospitals, often breaching the current 6-hour maximum waiting time target;</p>
            <p eId="para_7438">inpatient waiting times — the trend has been upwards recently, despite the work of the NTPF;</p>
            <p eId="para_7439">outpatient waiting times — the time from GP referral to an appointment with a consultant is unacceptably long in many specialties;</p>
            <p eId="para_7440">access to diagnostics — this forms an essential part of the patient journey for all of the areas of access above.</p>
            <p eId="para_7441">The SDU's success will allow for an alteration in the current role of the NTPF.  The Fund's resources will be re-focused to align closely with the work of the SDU and, crucially, will allow for a progressive improvement in the performance of the nation's hospitals. For the moment, the NTPF will continue to operate as normal, accepting applications from persons who have been waiting for over three months for treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7442">An immediate priority for the SDU will be to ensure that waiting lists for inpatient services are managed properly and that hospitals take responsibility for managing patient flows.  I have already stated that, in the transition period while the SDU is being established, there may be some increase in waiting lists, but this will be avoided if at all feasible. However, I cannot accept a position where some hospitals allow small numbers of patients to wait more than a year for their procedures and I expect this to be tackled quickly.  The NTPF has welcomed the new initiative and has confirmed it will work proactively with the Unit to achieve the best possible results for patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_7449">Ministerial powers and functions in relation to regional and local roads were transferred to my Department from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in January 2008, however, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants from my Department.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_7450">Following the severe weather in late 2009 and early 2010, local authorities were requested to provide details of exceptional road related costs associated with the prolonged severe weather, which fell outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance.</p>
            <p eId="para_7451">The Department took account of the information received when deciding on allocations for 2010.  The priority was to protect the massive investment of €6 billion in the regional and local roads network since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_7452">Local authorities were permitted to defer their planned rehabilitation works on regional and local roads in 2010 to allow greater flexibility to deal with the urgent repair of damage to the regional and local road network arising from the prolonged severely cold weather.

            <p eId="para_7638">Irish Rail is required to keep and publish annually separate profit and loss accounts and balance sheets, on the one hand for business relating to the provision of rail transport services, and, on the other, for business relating to the management and maintenance of the railway infrastructure.  The accounts are required to reflect the prohibition on State aid granted for the provision of transport services by Irish Rail transferred for use in the management of the railway infrastructure.  Irish Rail's Annual Report and Financial Statements for year ended 31 December 2010 have recently been published and are available on the CIE website at <i>www.cie.ie</i> and copies have also been placed in the Dáil Library.</p>

            <p eId="para_7641">The comprehensive review of capital expenditure which is being overseen by my colleague Mr Brendan Howlin, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is currently underway. This review is examining all capital programmes and projects, as regards their affordability,  their overall economic impact and job creation potential. A major consideration will be the need to prioritise funding to protect investment made to date and to maintain high safety standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_7642">The Deputy can be assured that I am fully apprised of how beneficial Metro North can be, for businesses, communities and future development in the North Dublin Region. As he may be aware, I am a former member of Fingal County Council and represent part of the town of Swords, which would be served by Metro North. The benefits of this project are not at issue, the issue is our capacity to fund it.</p>
            <p eId="para_7643">Metro North will cost several billions depending on the funding model used. In order for Metro North to be built, it will require both private funding by means of a PPP and exchequer funding. With regard to exchequer funding, this will be almost €1 billion during the term of this Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_7644">The successful awarding of a major PPP contract involving private funding is challenging at any time but is particularly challenging in current circumstances where Ireland has been the subject of intervention by the IMF/EU. Until financial credibility is restored the international debt funding market will be reluctant to lend funds to finance projects in Ireland, the repayment of which is ultimately dependent on the state. It is also not clear whether the Exchequer will be able to contribute its share of the cost in any case. In order for Metro North to be included in the revised National Development Plan 2012-2016, both private finance and exchequer finance must be available. The decision made on Metro North, will be made by the Government in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_7645">The issue of compensation should it arise, would be dealt with under the agreed  procurement terms between the RPA and the Metro North bidders, the details of which are commercially sensitive.</p>

            <p eId="para_7689">In the recent Jobs Initiative, I announced a three-pronged strategy to encourage inbound tourism.  The first element is the proposed suspension of the air travel tax, the second is a new growth incentive scheme which has been introduced by the Dublin Airport Authority and the third is more targeted co-operative marketing of new routes from key source tourism markets by Tourism Ireland, Dublin Airport Authority and the airlines to encourage more tourists to fly into Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_7690">My officials and I have engaged with the Dublin Airport Authority and with the four main Irish airlines about these initiatives and I also wrote to all of the other airlines operating services to and from the State airports.  Some proposals for additional capacity and new routes put forward are being examined by my Department and by external consultants to assess their potential impact.  I will await the outcome of that assessment and responses from other airlines before making a recommendation to my Cabinet colleagues on whether or not to suspend the tax.  The recent enactment of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 has provided the basis for the suspension of the air travel tax if we decide to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_7692">In my  announcements of the 8th and 24th June respectively I have clarified the  terms of reference and the membership of the Taxi Regulation Review Group, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  The  aim of the review is to enable  the necessary further reforms of the sector  to allow consumers  to have confidence in the  taxi system while also ensuring that legitimate and competent  operators and drivers  can be rewarded fairly  by operating  under a regulatory  framework  that is adequately enforced.  The review will address a wide range of issues relating to the taxi sector including the current regulatory policy and practices, licensing systems, enforcement and future dialogue with the taxi sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_7693">The regulation of the taxi industry is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the Public Transport Regulation Act, 2009.  The NTA is currently carrying out a public consultation on proposed regulatory measures for SPSV vehicle standards with a view to advancing new regulations to come into force in January 2012.  The results of this consultation process on SPSV vehicle standards will also feed directly into the work of the Taxi Regulation Review Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_7694">The idea on vehicle branding is to get feedback from operators in the taxi-sector on the matter and all responses will be assessed from there.  The primary goal of the review is to seek to clean up bad practices currently being engaged in and to ensure that those who operate legitimately in the taxi sector are rewarded fairly for their work.</p>
            <p eId="para_7695">I should add that the invitation for submissions  to be made on the Taxi Regulation Review and for the NTA consultation on SPSV vehicle standards extends to 5 August 2011.</p>

This Statutory Instrument sets out by-laws for the regulation of travel on Luas, including prohibited acts such as acting in a manner that is abusive, threatening or offensive to any person.  Similarly, section 22 of the Transport Act 1950 gives CIÉ the power to make by-laws and section 28 of the Transport (Re-organisation of CIÉ) Act 1986 provides that CIÉ's powers can be exercised on behalf of the subsidiary companies.

            <p eId="para_7714">Directive 95/21/EC on port State control of shipping was repealed on 1st January 2011 and replaced by Directive 2009/16/EC.   This directive introduced a new port State control regime called the New Inspection Regime (NIR), which strengthens port State control and focuses on sub-standard ships and the companies operating them.  It includes the provisions of the appropriate International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_7715">The new directive was transposed by the European Communities (Port State Control) Regulations 2010 (S.I.

The NIR is supported by a new international inspection database — "THETIS" — which is integrated with Ireland's maritime single-window web portal, "SafeSeasIreland" (SSI).

            <p eId="para_7722">Ireland offers a diverse range of maritime links to and from the State to facilitate trade and tourism.  In terms of connectivity, Ireland is one of the best served countries in Europe for passenger ferry services.  These links are frequent and competitive.  There are currently six shipping lines providing year round passenger services, with over 500 sailings weekly between Ireland and the United Kingdom and continental Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_7723">The latest ferry passenger data, currently being prepared by the IMDO for mid year 2011, suggests that passenger numbers for the first six months of this year are up on the same comparable periods during 2007, 2008 and 2009.  This excludes 2010 as the traffic volumes were distorted by a surge in ferry passenger numbers as a result of the volcanic ash cloud crisis.  The ash crisis was a timely reminder of the ability of our existing passenger services to adapt and deal with unprecedented demand in a very short period of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_7724">My Department through its agency the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) works closely with all existing operators and continues to promote Ireland as a location for new services.  Likewise, our commercial ports are seeking  to maximise their revenue potential with existing and new potential income streams.  Any new initiatives to enhance connectivity must be market driven, as it is not Government policy to fund international ferry services.</p>
            <p eId="para_7725">Fáilte Ireland is also involved in active promotion and marketing of sea access routes to Ireland in their role of promoting Ireland as a high quality and competitive tourist destination.  We will see record numbers of cruise passenger vessels calling to our ports this year.  The cruise vessels, while seasonal, are a welcome boost to regional economies bringing thousands of passengers per day to local shops and tourist venues.</p>
