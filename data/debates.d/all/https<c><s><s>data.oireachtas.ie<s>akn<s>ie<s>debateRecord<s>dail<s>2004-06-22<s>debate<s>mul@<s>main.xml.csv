I appreciate the Minister's response in providing more detailed information than may have been originally asked for. There appears to have been a doubling of oil prices in the past two years and the figures are increasing dramatically. Does the Department have any mechanism whereby the Central Statistics Office would contact line Departments to inform them of a noticeable trend if it occurred? Will the Minister of State say if her Department has any role in the whole emissions trading system for counting carbon, which in a sense is related to the question I am asking? Will it publish data on the use of carbon by different sectors in our economy, the cost of carbon trading as it occurs? Will her office or another Department have responsibility for reporting the exact figures in that regard? I know the Environment Protection Agency has a responsibility in setting up the scheme, but does the Minister envisage that the CSO should have a role in monitoring what is essentially a statistical operation?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The data, as presented, are derived from a combination of customs based non-EU trade statistics and estimates based on the Interstat survey of Irish traders engaged in trade with other EU member states. I have no information as to other facts raised by Deputy Ryan. These will come under the responsibility of the various relevant Departments. I can inquire as to further information that may be available.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The national treatment purchase fund was established to identify patients who have been waiting longest for surgical treatment and to arrange treatment for those patients. The NTPF works closely with health boards and individual hospitals to obtain information on patients and the specific surgical procedure required in each case. Currently, the information collected by the NTPF is collected by hospital and specialty rather than by individual consultant.The NTPF carried out a validation exercise on patients reported to be waiting for surgical treatments. As a result of this exercise it became clear that the number of patients reported to the Department includes those who are not immediately available for treatment or who would be unable to accept an offer of treatment for medical or other reasons. Therefore, the figures reported to the Department overstated the actual position at hospital level.In collecting and providing data to the NTPF, hospital management depends on the co-operation of individual consultants. To date, the NTPF has treated some 15,000 patients. This could not have been achieved without the co-operation of hospital consultants. It would be fair to say that the NTPF did not receive universal co-operation in the beginning. There were difficulties with James Connolly Memorial Hospital and the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin, as regards the small number of patients being referred by these hospitals to the NTPF. The NTPF is hopeful of a positive outcome following recent discussions with these hospitals. However, the NTPF is concerned at the very low level of referrals from St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, and the Mid-Western Health Board. If a higher number of patients were referred by both St. Vincent's and the Mid-Western Health Board more patients would have been treated and their respective waiting lists could have been reduced dramatically.It should be remembered that patients who have been waiting more than six months for treatment can contact the NTPF directly or through their general practitioners to arrange treatment.When the NTPF initially began to collect information, concerns were raised by some hospitals about patient confidentiality issues. Clarification was sought and received from the Data Protection Commissioner in this regard. In the overall interest of patient care and treatment, as well as on the basis that hospitals collected the patient data for the purpose of patient treatment, the commissioner was of the view that disclosure to the fund is compatible with the purpose for which patients gave the details in the first instance. The commissioner has considered, therefore, that the Data Protection Acts do not prohibit the disclosure by a data controller — the hospital, in this case — of patient data to the treatment fund. Information supplied to the national treatment purchase fund is treated in the strictest confidence.The fund does not request or retain the medical histories of patients. Medical notes associated with patients are not sought by the fund. It is in the best interest of patient care that details sought by the fund are provided by health boards and hospitals so treatment can be arranged for the patients concerned.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I recognise that some hospitals are co-operating with the treatment fund, but following the Minister's reply it is not clear to me whether hospitals or consultants are providing lists of patients. I find it utterly ludicrous that a State agency has to spend enormous sums of money on advertising on national radio to identify those public patients who are waiting for a public service, and that we cannot identify such people without recourse to advertisements on national radio. It seems to be a total waste of money. If consultants are not co-operating with the treatment fund, they are denying patients the opportunity to choose. They are making decisions on behalf of patients.The Minister should take a strong line on this issue. Does he agree that the lists do not belong to consultants? The patients do not belong to the consultants. As patients of the State, they are entitled to receive treatment in whatever way the State can deliver it to them. It is totally unacceptable that such money — over €1.5 million last year — has to be spent on advertising. I do not know what the relevant sum is this year. My question was prompted by hearing advertisements for the national treatment purchase fund every time I turn on the radio.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I disagree with the Deputy's comments on the advertising, which is necessary and good.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It acts as an additional lever for the system and helps people to know what they are entitled to. We should not underestimate the need for strong public campaigns to make people aware of what they can access and how they can access it. The treatment fund has received telephone calls from 9,272 people, of whom 2,145 were found to be eligible and were subsequently treated. I accept the Deputy's point about consultants giving lists of patients to hospitals. I pay tribute to the officials of the Department of Health and Children, from the Secretary General down, who orchestrated the mechanics of the establishment of the fund. I take advice from the chairperson and the chief executive officer of the fund on a regular basis. They advised me some time back about how best to proceed to get the fund up and running. The result has been very positive as up to 15,000 people have been treated.We have identified a number of hospitals that have not co-operated to the extent that we consider necessary and correct. The chairperson of the treatment fund has advised me about how best to proceed. I have followed that advice to a certain extent and significant progress has been made from the beginning. That 15,000 people have had operations to date demonstrates that the vast majority of consultants are co-operating. There have been significant improvements in waiting times in many hospitals. I have a list of up to ten hospitals that are referring patients for over three months. A further nine or ten hospitals are referring patients for over six months. Progress is being made. It is not acceptable for the other hospitals——

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	11	As the Deputy is aware, the administration of health services, including the placement of people into long-term care, is, in the first instance, a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards.I am aware that the Dublin academic teaching hospitals, DATHs, have been encountering problems with delayed discharges of patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed and who require to be discharged to more appropriate facilities. However, the claim that people might have to wait for up to 12 and a half years for discharge was, in my view, unjustified.The Deputy may be interested to know that I have regularly met administrative and medical representatives of the ERHA, the area health boards and the DATHs and, at the most recent meeting, I was advised by the authority that it has commenced a programme to re-open public extended care beds. I am, therefore, fully cognisant of the issues involved. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, is involved in these meetings.I understand the ERHA has made strenuous efforts in recent months to recruit staff and that these efforts are beginning to show results. This has allowed for the re-opening of 93 public extended care beds to date.Additional funding of €13.8 million has been provided to the ERHA this year to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system to a more appropriate setting, thereby freeing up acute beds. It allows for funding through the subvention system of additional beds in the private nursing home sector and ongoing support in the community. This funding has already resulted in the discharge of more than 350 patients from acute hospitals in the eastern region to different locations, the majority to private nursing homes.The ERHA is actively monitoring the situation and working with hospitals, the area health boards and the private nursing home sector to ensure every effort is made to minimise the number of delayed discharges from acute hospitals.The option of accessing beds in private nursing homes will be considered on an ongoing basis, bearing in mind that, for a variety of reasons, private nursing home beds often may not be suitable for the discharge of heavily dependent older people from acute hospitals.My Department provides significant funding for the nursing home subvention scheme and more than €443 million has been allocated cumulatively over the past five years. In 2000, the budget available for the scheme was €48.439 million and, this year, €115 million was made available, which is an increase of 137%.I will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, problems encountered by older people in the greater Dublin area in accessing services appropriate to their needs are minimised.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Minister stated that both he and the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, will monitor the situation but the reality is slightly different. The Minister's response to a recent request is unacceptable and shows a disregard for the needs of older people at a time when community care and home help services have been slashed.Does the Minister accept that community care areas, especially those in the greater Dublin area, are reporting a 12 and a half year waiting list for long-term public nursing care, especially since the withdrawal of contract beds from the system in September 2003? Arising from that, does the Minister accept that hundreds of acute hospital beds are being inappropriately occupied by older people in acute hospitals, thus leading to ongoing bed shortages and long waiting periods on trolleys in accident and emergency units while, at the same time, more than 2,000 private nursing home beds are unoccupied? Is it not time we examined this area to try to deal with the problem? The Minister's response generally referred to subvention, but the real problem is that the people who cannot afford subvention are being told that they will be dead before they have access to a public nursing home in 12 and a half years' time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I do not accept the basic content of the Deputy's argument. He is correct in one point in that it requires an overall package of measures which include community and nursing unit beds in the public sector, beds in the private nursing home sector, home care packages, which have been piloted in the Dublin region, and a more innovative approach to the procurement and securing of additional beds in the Dublin region. That is the reason we started out on the first public private partnership in health with a view to securing an additional 450 beds.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	14	That is a long time away.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	15	It is on the way. Unfortunately, due process must be entered into in the context of public private partnerships in that they must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities and go through the entire design phase. That is taking its course, but it is happening and is the most effective way we can significantly increase, within the next two years, the availability of beds in community nursing units on the public side.Historically, there has been a dearth of such public beds in Dublin because of the closure of many district hospitals in the 1980s and early 1990s. In the interim period, we have provided an increase of up to 137% in the cost of funding private nursing homes. Following discussions last year, additional funding has been given to the Eastern Regional Health Authority for a package of measures designed to free up acute beds and to allow the reasonable referral of patients, who have had acute treatment, to continuing care beds. This is done in a way to maximise allocation of beds and ensure value for money. This funding has resulted in approximately 330 people securing beds. The Department will continue to work with the Eastern Regional Health Authority in monitoring this and see how it can be improved.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The provision of services to the person in question is a matter for the Western Health Board. However, after inquiries to the board, I have been advised that the patient requires long-term care, rather than acute care, due to the complexities of the case. The Western Health Board has worked closely with the person's family, the staff at Mayo General Hospital and other health board departments which would have had a role to play in securing an appropriate placement in Galway.A transfer to University College Hospital, Galway was not an option as this hospital provides acute care and is not the appropriate place to admit patients who require long-term care. A second option was an admission to a Western Health Board long-term care facility such as Merlin Park Hospital or St. Brendan's Hospital in Loughrea. However, a referral had previously been made to the admission team responsible for such facilities. It was refused on the grounds that the consultant geriatrician involved does not admit people below the age of 65 years requiring long-term care.The third option explored was placement in a private nursing home. A particular nursing home was identified and the following process was agreed. The Western Health Board would be in a position to fund such a placement, the cost of which would have in excess of the maximum which is available under nursing home subvention. A meeting of clinicians would take place to ascertain if the needs of the person in question could be met in this nursing home. The family and Mayo General Hospital staff would then be invited to visit the nursing home.On confirmation that the Western Health Board would provide funding to support the person's placement in this nursing home, relatives visited it. The meeting between the team in Mayo General Hospital and the nurse manager of the nursing home took place recently. Unfortunately, despite a great willingness on everyone's part to facilitate this placement, it was concluded that the nursing home would not be in a position to meet the patient's extensive medical needs. This outcome was communicated to the person's family by the social worker in Mayo General Hospital who is the main contact with the family. Further options are being explored in consultation with the family. The board has assured me that it will work with the person's family and engage with them in any actions it takes on their behalf.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I thank the Minister for his reply but it is not acceptable. Previously, I attempted to raise this issue under Standing Order 31. The person in question is 48 years old, was born in Galway yet has been in Mayo General Hospital for the last two and a half years after suffering complications from a brain aneurysm. She now requires constant nursing care and has had a tracheotomy tube inserted.The excellent care provided by Mayo General Hospital is readily acknowledged by her family. However, this lady lived in County Mayo for less than a year. When she fell ill, she was taken to Mayo General Hospital. Her 12 year old son must make a 100 mile round trip to visit her and is now suffering from lack of contact with his mother, although she can still hear and feel. The lady in question is being kept in an acute hospital because it is the only place in the region capable of caring for her. Why can she not be cared in an acute hospital nearer her family home?When a relative of the lady, a constituent of the Minister's, contacted him at his Grand Parade office concerning the matter two years ago, he informed her it would be sorted out. The relative was sent to the Western Health Board and still nothing has been resolved. In answer to a parliamentary question submitted by me last February, the Minister replied that the matter would be resolved by the Western Health Board. Two years have passed and still there has been no resolution. This is unacceptable.Every nursing home in County Mayo has been examined for a placement for the lady but none has the facilities for her care. She is not accepted by long-stay care institutions because she is not yet 65. Does the Minister think he has failed?The Western Health Board told this family that the facility available, an eight-bedroom ward with Alzheimer's patients, is "not a pretty picture". We are trying to get this lady into a nursing home but none will take her because she needs so much care. The Western Health Board is sending people to nursing homes who require a high level of care which cannot be given there. Why is there no State facility for such people? Why is this lady being denied a place in a Galway hospital when she requires acute care? The Western Health Board said that nursing homes and long-stay homes are not suitable for her. Her 12 year old son lives in Galway.

One does not have to be in an acute hospital to avail of the package of care required in this case. Similar packages of care have been provided in other areas of the country in contexts different to acute hospital settings. No one would realistically suggest that we provide for cases such as this in an acute hospital setting. The case highlights the situation with the young chronic sick for whom there has been an historic deficit of suitable standalone units. I acknowledge that.

The Deputy is correct in stating that additional funding of approximately €90 million has been invested in mental health services since 1997. This funding has enabled real progress to be made in providing additional medical and health professional staff for expanding community mental health services, to increase child and adolescent services, to expand the old age services and to provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals. For example, in 1997 there were 207 consultant psychiatric posts and by 2004 this had increased by 74 to a total of 281. This includes an extra 19 child and adolescent psychiatrists, eight psychiatrists of learning disability, three forensic psychiatrists, 28 adult psychiatrists and an extra 16 old age psychiatrists.In addition to the increased revenue funding outlined, substantial capital funding has also been provided to mental health services over the lifetime of the national development plan to fund the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals as a replacement for services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. In addition to the 21 acute units now in place, a number of units are currently at various stages of development.Health boards continue to develop a comprehensive, community-based mental health service. This has resulted in a continuing decline in the number of in-patients from 5,192 in 1997 to 3,966 in 2002 with a corresponding increase in the provision of a wide range of care facilities based in the community to complement in-patient services. There are now 411 community psychiatric residences in the country providing 3,146 places compared to 391 residences providing 2,878 places in 1997.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseA very significant development within the area of mental health service provision in recent years has been the enactment of the Mental Health Act 2001. The main vehicle for the implementation of the provisions of the Act is the Mental Health Commission which was established in April 2002. The commission's primary function is to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected.The Mental Health Commission's strategic plan 2004-05, published earlier this year, indicates that one of its priorities for the commission is to put in place the structures required for the operation of mental health tribunals, as provided for in Part 2 of the Act. This year, additional funding of €3 million is available to the commission for this purpose. The commission is currently in discussion with my Department, the health boards and other relevant agencies to ensure that all elements of the organisational and support systems required are in place prior to the commencement of Part 2 of the Mental Health Act 2001.Under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001 the commission has appointed Dr. Teresa Carey to the position of Inspector of Mental Health Services. A team of assistant inspectors has also been appointed. The inspector had indicated that she expects to commence a programme of inspections of mental health facilities from June 2004.The Deputy has referred to psychotherapy and family therapy, services generally provided within the health boards by clinical psychologists. I recognise that service providers have experienced particular difficulty in recruiting clinical psychologists. One of the main reasons for this has been the very small number of post-graduate training places available for such professionals. My Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, have been examining various issues in relation to human resource planning for clinical psychologists in the health services, including the need to increase the number of postgraduate psychology training places on a planned and sustainable medium-term basis. It is worth noting that since 1999 there has been a threefold increase from 26 to 84 in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services.While substantial improvements have been made in recent years in the delivery of mental health care and in the quality of mental health facilities, I acknowledge that much remains to be done. To ensure that we continue to obtain the best possible return on our investment in this important area of health care, I appointed an expert group on mental health policy in August 2003 to review all areas of mental health policy and service provision. The group consists of 18 widely experienced people who are serving in their personal capacities. The membership encompasses a wide range of knowledge and a balance of views on many issues affecting the performance and delivery of care in our mental health services. The group is expected to complete its work in 2005.

However, does he not agree that funding of €90 million since 1997 is a national disgrace? It is approximately one and a half times what was spent on electronic voting and, at an average of €11 million per year, is €4 million less than was spent this year on Punchestown. This level of investment, the lowest of any of the medical services, totally ignores the one in four people who will suffer from a mental illness during their lifetime. Why is the national treatment purchase fund not available to those in need of assistance and on a waiting list for more than 12 months? Why is treatment for varicose veins considered more important than for depression when such procedures are available under the national treatment purchase fund?With regard to figures quoted by the Minister, of the 400 clinical psychology posts funded, 180 are vacant. Why is this the case when the psychiatrists association, in its presentation to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, stated that 73% of all psychiatrists do not have a psychologist available to them? The association further stated that the presence of a multi-disciplinary team was connected to the improvement and cure of those being treated for psychological and psychiatric illnesses.

I recognise that service providers have experienced particular difficulty in recruiting clinical psychologists. One of the main reasons for this has been the very small number of postgraduate training places available for such professionals. My Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, has been examining various issues in relation to human resource planning for clinical psychologists.

Many attended from North and South and they were extremely disappointed that, despite sending invitations to psychiatrists from North and South, not one attended. Nonetheless, it was a fantastic meeting and good to listen to the users of the services, who have much to say about the provision of services. Users need to be listened to more, and I intend to do this.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act 1970 determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. As a matter of course, the medical card income guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The last such increase was notified in January 2004.For those who do not qualify for a medical card there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication, including the long-term illness scheme and the drug payments scheme. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean a child or other person will not be eligible for a medical card. It may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card if their parents are medical card holders. Those who are dependants of non-medical card holders are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under European Union regulations or where they are in receipt of a disability allowance. Students who are financially independent of their parents are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants. The decision on whether a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. In line with the health strategy, Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You, the possibility of extending the medical card by statute to various groups, including children, is under ongoing review in my Department in the context of the strategy's second goal.Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.As the Deputy is aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children, especially those with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation, I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year, but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within its lifetime.

Does he recall that on the previous occasion I raised the question, he stated it was due to the prevailing budgetary situation that he was unable to fulfil the Government's pre-general election commitment? Does he accept that, since making the statement last December, the budgetary situation has improved greatly and the economic trends are showing an upward turn? If there was any real excuse last December for the answer he gave, I do not believe it would apply currently.Is the Minister aware that a married couple with two children, with a miserly income of €260 per week, will not qualify for free general practitioner care for their children? Does he agree this is scandalous in the Ireland of 2004? Has he any idea of the real hardship families are suffering, especially where the choice is between GP referral and prescriptions and the needs of everyday life? The Government's health strategy repeatedly stresses the vital importance of primary care, and the Minister rightly repeats it. Is he aware that many children are denied proper access to primary care because of the financial circumstances of their families? Will he explain why it is that the principle of universal qualification can apply to people over the age of 70 but cannot apply to children under the age of 18?Does the Minister agree that the fact that so many families suffer in this situation reflects the inadequate threshold for qualification where the bar is much too low? It needs to be heightened in terms of the qualification levels. Does he propose in the course of this Dáil to extend medical card cover to all children under 18 years of age?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The Government programme is for five years. I indicated in reply to a parliamentary question in December and recently that the financial envelope allocated to me this year with which I must work does not facilitate increasing the medical card income threshold. I accept the thresholds are too low and that a certain category of people would benefit from an increase in them. Given that we are in Government for five years, I hope we will be in a position to fulfil a commitment we gave to extend medical card eligibility to approximately 200,000 extra people and to target it at those in greatest need.It is fair to say that, over the past two years, the cost of the general medical services, GMS, scheme has increased dramatically. If one examines the graph over the past three years, there has been a dramatic increase in the cost of drugs and the number of prescriptions, including the arrival on the scene of new drugs which are more expensive. We had to provide an additional €200 million this year for the overall GMS budget just to maintain provision for current medical card holders in the population. It is also fair to point out that the increase in employment in recent years has taken many people above the income thresholds so the number of medical card holders as a percentage of the population has declined by a number of percentage points.The Deputy voted for the extension of medical card provision to the over 70 year olds. The Deputy's policy platform would extend medical card provision even wider so it baffles me how he can criticise the extension of medical card provision to the over 70 year olds while, on the other hand, have a completely different view——

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I have called Question No. 7.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Health boards established pursuant to the Health Act 1970 are obliged by section 58 to provide general practitioner services free of charge to persons having full eligibility for health services. Responsibility for the determination of the eligibility of an applicant to a medical card is, by legislation, a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide, having regard to the individual circumstances of each case. Medical cards are normally issued to persons for whom, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the local health board, the provision of general practitioner and surgical services for them and their dependants would cause undue financial hardship.Negotiations with general practitioners who provide services for medical card holders in the GMS scheme have been conducted on this basis. Any plans to change the spirit or the extent of the operation of the GMS scheme in the area of eligibility would necessarily mean further negotiations with representatives of the medical and pharmacy professions. It is, therefore, extremely difficult to assess accurately the likely cost of the introduction of universal eligibility to a medical card. However, based on preliminary figures from the GMS Payments Board for the average national cost for the provision of GP services to medical card patients for 2003, it could cost in the region of €685 million per annum to provide general practitioner services to the balance of the population. To give free pharmacy services for the range of approved prescribed medications, again for the balance of the population and based on the 2003 preliminary figures from the GMS Payments Board, could cost in the region of an extra €1.64 billion. Neither of these figures takes into account any changes which may result in the fee structures for either GPs or pharmacists following negotiation with these contractors.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The Minister is correct that the current income threshold for medical cards is too low. It is half the minimum wage, which is, effectively, destitution. One must be destitute to qualify for a medical card. The reason I asked this question is to explore the possibility of something less than a full medical card service for people. Each taxpayer pays an average of €6,000 to the health service and, undoubtedly, the cost of the GMS is high and increasing.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Would the Minister accept that pouring money into a bloated hospital system is not giving value for money? Is he willing to explore the possibility, albeit that it might require new negotiations with pharmacists and general practitioners, of changing the focus of the health system towards one of prevention and primary care and of targeting specific illnesses rather than insisting that we should stay with the old medical card system?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I agree with the Deputy that we should continue to invest more in primary care and prevention. However, we must be careful in allocating available resources. We need to target and prioritise the resources. I favour targeting resources towards children and people with disabilities in the context of access to general practitioner services as the first priority. A blanket allocation of up to €600 million, and the amount could be even more given that this figure is estimated before any negotiations take place, would not be the best allocation of scarce resources.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	61	That is not what I suggested. I was asking about a targeted approach as a halfway house. People with chronic illnesses, for example, have no medical card.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Many have and some do not because of the long-term illness card.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Does the Minister accept that the price of his failure to extend the medical card scheme is being paid by families on low incomes, including those with children? The Minister has reduced the total number of patients with medical cards by 100,000. People are losing out, although the Minister promised in the programme for Government that they would gain.The Minister struck a deal with GPs under which they are paid almost four times more for treating a wealthy patient over 70 under the medical card scheme than a poorer patient over 70. Surely this is bad value for money and prevents the natural expansion of the scheme to provide for those most in need.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I do not accept that 100,000 people lost out because of a failure to increase the threshold for eligibility. The vast majority of those people are over the income limit because of the thousands of extra jobs that have been created in recent years. Whether or not we like to admit it, income levels for those with jobs have gone up substantially over the past five years and this rendered some people ineligible for the medical card scheme.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Income levels have not gone up substantially. Let us get real.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	66	That is the reality. I have answered the Deputy's question.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Yes, but many who found jobs over the past four or five years went over the income limit for eligibility for the scheme and as a result did not receive medical cards.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Minister should get real. They are still on low wages.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	71	The Deputy has tried to have it every way on the issue of the over 70s for a long time. Prior to any agreement she was asking every day when we would strike a deal with the hard-pressed GPs. That was her position. Then she endorsed the extension of the medical card scheme to all those over 70 by voting for it. Irrespective of all her rhetoric, she trooped through the lobbies and voted for it.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I did not vote for incompetence.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	75	This has had an interesting outcome in terms of value for money. There has been some evaluation of the extension of the scheme and it is showing good results in terms of the frequency of visits to GPs by elderly people and the resulting improvement in vaccination levels and general health. That is good value for money by anyone's standards.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I have answered that question already.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, which was launched by the Taoiseach in July 1999, refers to the need for early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation and the provision of equipment and training to health professionals, particularly GPs in rural areas.The most disadvantaged in gaining access to early intervention and treatment through all the links of the survival chain are those resident in rural communities, due to the fact that they are furthest away from hospital services. In recognition of this, a number of geographically large health boards have introduced projects to facilitate early response to chest pain or suspected coronary attack for people in isolated areas. Many health boards have developed programmes to train either professionals or members of the public in first responder skills. Many boards have purchased defibrillators for use by GPs.Other initiatives have been taken. In the North Eastern Health Board area in 2002, 700 school children were educated on what to do in the event of a cardiac emergency. The Western Health Board introduced Community Action in Response to Emergency, a project that trains members of the public in first responder skills. In the north west, the existing Donegal pre-hospital project, referred to in Building Healthier Hearts as a model for other boards to follow, was expanded through the purchase of equipment and extended to Sligo and Leitrim. The Southern Health Board developed a first responder scheme in Dingle.A start has been made in the provision of defibrillators in public places, including Dublin Airport and Blanchardstown shopping centre in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. In Blanchardstown shopping centre, 22 customer care staff were trained in the use of an automated external defibrillator, five of which are placed strategically around the centre. Staff are retrained every 90 days at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown. The lessons from this public access defibrillation pilot project will be examined to inform further developments in this area.Notwithstanding the immediate and obvious benefits of the provision of defibrillators in public areas, it is also essential to have sustained services in place. All ambulances are now equipped with defibrillators and most ambulance staff have received appropriate training in the area. Six community resuscitation training officers and 21 hospital-based training officers have been recruited by health boards, improving the resuscitation skills of staff working in the community and hospitals.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I will ask a very brief question as my colleague, Deputy Timmins, who has a specific interest in this issue, wishes to contribute. From the Minister's point of view — I recognise that work is ongoing around the country — the main way in which the Minister can facilitate, encourage and support this system, which operates on a voluntary basis in some areas, is through the introduction of good Samaritan legislation, which is required to protect individuals who offer this kind of treatment. Will the Minister consider that?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I consulted the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council on liability issues for participants in first responder schemes and it has provided some observations. It sought legal advice on the exposure of an individual to litigation. It is now examining how best to disseminate that information to assist those participating in or considering establishing first responder schemes. I do not, therefore, believe we need a good Samaritan act. The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council has been a major catalyst in rolling out the first responder scheme and in informing best practice across the country. If it suggests it is necessary, I will be open to introducing legislation. However, it has not so far done so.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Is the Minister aware that many communities have bought defibrillators in recent months? In Wicklow ten such machines have been purchased by various communities. On the issue of insurance, the difficulty is that they might not be able to join in the first responders mechanism because they will not have enough volunteers in the community. I ask the Minister to keep an open mind regarding good Samaritan legislation. Will he initiate discussions with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the possibility of holding these machines in Garda stations if there is no other suitable place within the locality? In addition, will he examine, with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the county managers, the possibility of including in county development plans a requirement that, where a development exceeds a certain size and attracts many people, such as the Blanchardstown shopping centre, the airport and Croke Park, these machines be available?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Yes. That is a constructive suggestion. I will work with the Deputy and the agencies he mentioned in requesting that.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	87	It is extremely important that defibrillators are being provided. The Minister stated that they are in all ambulances, but the difficulty is in getting the ambulance to the person, particularly for treatments other than those related to heart problems. The Western Health Board area is unique in terms of the distance of bases from people. To achieve a proper standard of care, it is necessary to reach the person within the golden hour, but that is impossible in the Western Health Board area. Three bases are badly needed. Will the Minister address that problem, because no matter how many defibrillators there are, they are no good in an ambulance if the ambulance cannot get to the patient within the required time?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	88	There has been a dramatic improvement in the ambulance service in recent years compared to four or five years ago. I continue to prioritise investment in ambulance services. The Department has approved training for the emergency medical technicians advanced programme which will train EMTs to the level where they can administer other drugs, particularly thrombolytic drugs, in cases of heart attack. That will require legislative change which it is hoped will be brought to a conclusion very shortly, following legal advice we have received.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 51 and 71 together.The Government is committed to progressing the implementation of the Hanly report for the benefit of all patients. I have established implementation groups for the Hanly report in both the east coast and mid-western regions. The groups will carry out the detailed work of identifying the services that should be provided in each hospital, in line with the Hanly recommendations.Regarding hospital services outside these two regions, I have announced the composition of a group to prepare a national plan for acute hospital services. The group contains a wide range of expertise from the areas of medicine, nursing, health and social care professions and management. It also includes an expert in spatial planning and representation of the public interest. The group has been asked to prepare a plan for the reorganisation and development of acute hospital services, taking account of the recommendations of the national task force on medical staffing, including spatial, demographic and geographic factors. Neither the local implementation groups nor the acute hospitals review group has been able to meet due to the consultants' continuing industrial action. I again ask that all parties return to the table to progress the work of these groups.I emphasise that the Hanly report is about developing hospitals, not closing them. In the mid-western region's acute hospitals, for example, we have increased the total staff numbers by almost 1,200 since 1997. We have provided an 80 extra consultants during that period and increased ambulance personnel by 77%. There have been important investments in Ennis, including a new €5.7 million acute psychiatric unit, and I have approved the appointment of design teams for further improvements in Ennis General Hospital and Nenagh General Hospital. These initiatives illustrate the Government's commitment to smaller hospitals as a continuing and vibrant element of our acute services.Other key elements of the Hanly proposals are being progressed. Negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation on the reduction of NCHD working hours are continuing in the Labour Relations Commission. A national co-ordinator and support team are overseeing the implementation process in the health agencies. Regarding the consultant contract, a number of meetings have taken place between officials of my Department, health service employers and representatives of the Irish Hospitals Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation. These talks are also affected by the current programme of industrial action by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.On medical education and training, the sub-group of the task force which dealt with these issues has remained in place. The group has been asked to examine and report to me on the measures required to accommodate NCHD training in all postgraduate programmes and safeguard both training and service delivery during the transition to a 48-hour working week. A major national seminar was held last January involving all stakeholders including training bodies, employers and medical representative bodies. Drawing on the views expressed at this seminar and the ongoing work of the medical education and training group, draft proposals have been developed with a view to ensuring the provision of high-quality training for NCHDs in the context of the initial implementation of the 58-hour week and the eventual implementation of the 48-hour working week. I anticipate that these proposals will be submitted to me in the near future.

The Minister for Defence stated that in this House in relation to Nenagh hospital. Will the Minister with responsibility outline exactly where stands the Hanly report?Noting that Hanly states that in time "in local hospitals there should not be a requirement for on-site medical presence overnight or at weekends", does the Minister accept that if adopted this would mean that most smaller hospitals will not be able to provide in-patient care or effective accident and emergency services since they both require 24-hour medical cover? Will the Minister accept that the Hanly proposals to downgrade local hospitals should be set aside because they are unworkable and unacceptable?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I do not accept what the Deputy has said. I answered a number of questions on this over recent months. I made the point earlier that following discussions with the chairman of the Hanly group in January it was agreed that there would be 24-hour medical cover in acute hospitals across the country. I explained the last time I was here that the health board in the Ennis and Nenagh area took a decision following submissions from the Irish Medical Council to advertise for the recruitment of emergency care physicians, qualified doctors——

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Reference to the two years is in the advertisement, there is no secret about that. The point I make, and which I made then, is that this was not in response to the Hanly report. This was an immediate issue on which we had to respond, namely, points made by the Irish Medical Council in communications to the health board. Deputy Ó Caoláin, coming from Monaghan, is aware of the importance of the Irish Medical Council, which is a standard-setting body, and the royal colleges, the Institute of Obstetricians, the Royal College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians or whatever, in influencing what eventually happens in acute hospitals and the configuration of services. It is better to have certainty on an overall national framework as to how our acute hospitals will be organised, rather than limping on depending on the latest six monthly review of a college, which can suddenly change the capacity of a given hospital and what it is doing.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Is the Minister aware that during the local election campaign, the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, allowed a letter sent to him by the Minister to be published in the local press? In the letter he gave an undertaking that there would continue to be a full accident and emergency service on a 24 hour seven day a week basis at Loughlinstown hospital. This caused a certain amount of mystification as it is a flat contradiction of the recommendations of the Hanly report, which is supported by the Government. In the Hanly report, St. Columcille's Hospital is to become a local hospital that will no longer have a full 24 hour seven day a week accident and emergency service provided to the local community. Yet during an election campaign, the Minister put commitments in writing that the service is protected into the future. How does the Minister intend to square the circle? The Minister is now contradicting recommendations of the Hanly report, even though he accepted them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	97	There was a great deal of mischief during the election campaign and Deputies across the House were responsible and clearly took a decision, once the Hanly report was published, to milk it for electoral advantage.

The tables show attendance in accident and emergency departments between midnight and eight o' clock in the morning. People have suggested to me that we need 21 senior consultants to cover two attendances per night. Is that what the Opposition is suggesting? If we propose some alternative, is that akin to closing the accident and emergency department? That is the kind of duplicity that has been articulated in recent months on this issue. I only want to improve the outcome for people.

Does the Minister accept that Hanly has failed in that respect? On 1 August, hospitals all around the country will be completely unprepared to deal with it. Arrangements are being made to cancel some services and clinics and to hire GPs to work in the hospitals, although GPs themselves are an endangered species. Is Hanly basically dead on all fronts?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The Hanly group was established following the report on medical manpower a number of years ago. It was set up explicitly in a non-industrial relations and a non-political context, to start with a blank sheet and ask how hospital services should be organised in the Mid-West or the East Coast Area Health Board in the context of a 48 hour working week. They were explicitly told not to get involved in the industrial relations implications. That was a matter for the Government and the social partners, not the Hanly group. It is wrong to apportion blame to the Hanly group for any industrial relations difficulties in pursuing the 58 hour working week by next August, or the 48 hour working week by 2009. That is the factual position.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Does the Minister accept that services will be affected?

#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I am here due to the frustration in sorting out patients in the Mayo general hospital and further afield. The Hanly report seems to get away from the real needs of the people. There has been a backtrack on the report regarding hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh. Originally it was supposed to be a nursing unit from nine o' clock in the morning to five o' clock in the evening, but we now hear about a GP on cover after that. Is the Minister stating that acute medical and surgical services by consultants around the clock will continue in Nenagh and Ennis?When the second Hanly report is implemented in Mayo general hospital, we will lose the orthopaedic service we have due to a campaign I started ten years ago. We would not have that service now only for that campaign because the institute of orthopaedic surgeons did not want it. Vested interests are doing their damnedest to stop a campaign now. I sent in a request to the Mayo general hospital, which handles the urology service for Galway, for a gentleman with prostate cancer on 30 December 2003. To date that man has not been called. Ten new patients are seen every month by two surgeons who attend on alternate months. Is the Minister aware that that list dates back to 1996? The man concerned was put on that list last December. Is that acceptable?Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar, needs a urologist but, under the Hanly report, will not get one. As regards orthopaedic services, people believed that one would hold what one had. We need to update our urology services. The Hanly report is a disaster. The distance from Mayo to Galway is virtually the same as from Galway to Dublin. Does the Minister expect people to travel to Galway for a 20-minute prostate operation? Is it acceptable that the man concerned, who has cancer, has been waiting since last December for a urology appointment?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	145	The Deputy asked a number of questions. There has been no back-track on promises for Nenagh or Ennis hospitals. The Mid-Western Health Board, independently of me, had to respond quickly to communications from the Irish Medical Council on the continuation of services in the accident and emergency departments in Nenagh and Ennis hospitals.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The Hanly report is a ten-year document which did not suggest the closure or alteration next week or next year of the accident and emergency departments in Nenagh and Ennis hospitals. The Mid-Western Health Board submitted its model to the Department and the post was sanctioned. In the cold light of day, that is what happened. People put all types of spins on the matter prior to the election. However, I am not responsible for the outcome in that regard.The Deputy is wrong to forecast doom and gloom in the context of the acute hospital review group considering acute hospital services across the country. The Government, led by Fianna Fáil with the Progressive Democrats, has invested significantly in Mayo General Hospital, an investment which has transformed the fabric of that hospital.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I do not suggest there is not more to be done at Mayo General Hospital. However, at some stage in the process we must acknowledge, as I did on local radio recently, the enormous investment made in that hospital. The review group is examining issues such as peripherality. I have appointed a special planner and people from the regions to take on board the needs of people living in rural Ireland and its periphery. Hanly has not yet reported on the west. Deputy Cowley will be aware that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has done more for the west in terms of adding medical services than any previous Government or coalition of parties.

He stated that it is wrong that anybody should have to wait six months to find out what is happening. However, that is what is happening in terms of Monaghan General Hospital, which is reviewed every six months.The Minister did not visit the hospital prior to the recent local and European elections but visited it prior to the last general election. Accident and emergency services at Monaghan General Hospital closed during the first week in July 2002. During his visit, the Minister gave a commitment to five Oireachtas Members to do his best to have them reopened as quickly as possible. Is the Minister prepared to give to Monaghan General Hospital the same commitment he is making to the hospitals in Nenagh and Ennis? He has invested a great deal of money in the hospital in Castlebar.I was delighted with Mr. Kevin Bonner's appointment to the review group. That group suggested that a minimum of €14 million was needed if the hospital was to reopen its accident and emergency service. However, the Minister provided only €2.7 million in that regard. Is that fair play to a Border area which suffered so much as a result of the Troubles? The Minister's representative, Mr. Paul Robinson, stated today on radio that he has overall responsibility in this area. The Minister can no longer place the blame on the health boards. Mr. Robinson stated that the Department has come a long way in terms of the development of hospital services in the eastern health board region.Is the closure of Monaghan General Hospital to accident and emergency and many other services the way this Minister wants to go? Is he prepared to give a commitment to reopen services at Monaghan General Hospital, as he did in regard to the hospitals in Nenagh and Ennis?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I am not placing the blame on them, I am stating the reality. This is not a question of placing blame. The health board looked at the problem innovatively in response to the Irish Medical Council which was threatening, in terms of communication to the board, to close accident and emergency services in Ennis and Nenagh. The board responded with its proposal which the Irish Medical Council accepted. That is the reality of the situation.The North Eastern Health Board has drawn up proposals for Monaghan General Hospital, a matter of which I am sure the Deputy is aware. I urge Deputy Crawford and others to speak to the various interests in Monaghan with a view to getting people around the table. I understand the board recently produced a reasonable set of proposals. I met the Mid-Western Health Board and the medical board in Cavan, both of which urged that there be closer liaison between the two hospital campuses and that a set of proposals be tabled which could lead to constructive dialogue and engagement between the various parties with everybody signing off on the proposals to begin the journey onwards. Unfortunately there has been a lack of agreement between the parties involved. The degree of unwillingness of certain quarters to put their heads above the parapet and take risks in progressing some of the issues has held up progress.The Deputy referred to the closure of on-call services at the hospital. Earlier I raised with Deputy Ó Caoláin the question of why the hospital originally went off-call — the Royal College of Anaesthesia undertook its own examination of services and came to the conclusion that they did not meet its standards. It pulled the rug on the continuation of on-call services at Monaghan General Hospital.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	187	One of the key goals of the Government's health strategy is to improve access for public patients through a significant increase in acute hospital bed capacity. The Government indicated in the health strategy that it was committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide some of the additional capacity required in the acute hospital sector. Towards this end, my Department has developed close contacts with the Independent Hospitals Association of Ireland.For its part, the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, purchases procedures from private hospitals in Ireland. Where it is not possible to treat patients within a reasonable period in public hospitals arrangements are made to refer the public patients for treatment in private hospitals having regard to quality, availability and cost. The majority of procedures funded by the NTPF to date have been carried out in private hospitals in Ireland. To date the NTPF has arranged treatment for some 15,000 patients who have been waiting longest on waiting lists.The Minister for Finance has moved to promote investment in the private hospital sector. Section 64 of the Finance Act 2001 as amended by section 32 of the Finance Act 2002 provides for significant tax allowances for the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospital facilities under conditions which will also benefit public patients. I expect that the health services executive, when established on a statutory basis, will promote a strategic partnership with the private hospital sector with the objective of securing enhanced treatment options for public patients.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I accept the Minister's comments regarding the purchase of services in the private sector. However, I am worried about the emergence of a large number of private hospitals in an ad hoc, unplanned and unco-ordinated manner. That is not an optimum use of resources from anyone’s point of view. Does the Minister accept that those hospitals are emerging in response to market forces with people demanding services not available to them from the State in the quantity required or in any sort of timely manner? If the private sector can provide those services, why does the State not work in tandem with it, commissioning services from it so that there is some sort of co-ordination in the planning of hospitals around the country?At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, the Minister refused to give any kind of commitment to purchase radiotherapy services in Waterford, although there is a clear demand for them and a lack of capacity in the country as a whole. It defies understanding that we are not availing of the capacity provided by the private sector, given that incentives are being provided by the Department of Finance, as the Minister has said.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	189	There is a one-minute time limit.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The direction in which we are going is leading to a duplication of resources. It is completely wasteful and we will end up with a far less equitable service. God knows the service lacks equity as it is. If we go down this route, the result will be that only those who can pay will have access to services.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Tax incentives and the treatment purchase fund have proved effective mechanisms to make use of additional private sector capacity in the system. They represent a complementary approach. For a whole range of procedures and specialties, there is no reason that some of the capacity demands should not be met by private sector hospitals being established, especially for day surgery, which has been the main driver for productivity increases in the acute hospital sector to date. There is a great deal of potential for increased capacity in day case procedures and surgical activities which may be funded through the treatment purchase fund. Some 50% of the population is now insured under private health insurance and the market can take a degree of additional capacity.For the more major, supraregional specialties such as cardiac or neural surgery or radiotherapy, there is a need for synergy between the State and private sectors. However, the State sector has set out its stall. The Government has tried to build up capacity in radiotherapy, which we know was lacking historically. We had only one major centre at St. Luke's and two machines in Cork. That was the sum total of our radiotherapy infrastructure. Some years ago we gave a commitment to set up a radiotherapy unit in Galway. That was long before any private hospital facility was available and that is now almost ready. The building has been completed and the equipment is coming on stream. Staff are now being recruited.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	192	What is the Minister's view on the fact that money is being lost to the Exchequer through the tax breaks the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, gave to encourage the provision of private day hospitals as a result of his being lobbied by a constituent? Had it been retained that money would have been more than enough to pay for the opening of almost €500 million worth of public facilities that had been closed or cannot be opened because money has not been forthcoming from the Cabinet. Does the Minister not think it bad value that we are losing money from our taxation system to build private day hospitals yet we cannot commission public facilities which are already built because not enough funding is being provided by the Minister for Finance? Such public facilities might be fully functioning if a relatively modest amount of money had been retained.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	193	The Deputy is assuming the funding that went to hospitals through the tax relief scheme would not have gone elsewhere. We have a range of tax relief schemes of which people avail. Increasingly they are investing abroad in the global economy. Therefore, it is always important that one has mechanisms to attract and retain capital for domestic investment projects.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	195	There is no question that we have expanded the public service a great deal in the past five years. We have opened many new units and have several ready to open. Many were equipped but could not be opened until towards the end of the year. The Government is currently dealing with how to commission and open those units over the next two years, as they come on stream. There is an open question about the level of revenue. In theory, if one abolished the tax relief, some money should come back into the Exchequer but it could go elsewhere.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The Minister did not mention that some facilities have been waiting to be opened since last June which is a year ago. We are not talking about facilities that will come on stream by the end of this year. I am asking about facilities that are due to be opened or should have been opened many months ago but have not been opened.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	197	That is the result of ongoing discussions regarding the opening and commissioning of those buildings, including the provision of equipment. The equipment is being provided in several of the units. There are issues with the other units to do with finance and the employment ceiling.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I am amazed that people have marched for a radiotherapy unit for the south-east. There were four massive marches and the Government was reduced to one Progressive Democrats and one Fianna Fáil member on Waterford City Council. Surely it will get the message. People are marching not to bring down the Government but for basic services. A radiotherapy unit in the grounds of Waterford Regional Hospital would provide the missing modality. As well as surgery and chemotherapy, it would provide radiotherapy. For less than the travel costs of transporting people where they do not wish to go, those facilities could be provided in Waterford. I ask the Minister how he can justify not providing that.I also wonder about the money put into the treatment purchase fund. There is an old saying that if one gives a man a fish, one will feed him for a day, whereas, if one teaches him to fish, one will feed him for life. Where there are no consultants, there are massive waiting lists. For example, in Mayo General Hospital, 1,000 people are waiting for urology services and 1,500 for orthopaedics. What is the point in taking those people under the treatment purchase fund and paying people to carry out the work when one could open those facilities and have a local service without such long waiting lists? That quick-fix solution will not work. If one considers the numbers there and the treatment purchase fund itself, one sees that those people have been waiting on that urology list since 1996 which is eight and a half years. That is a long time to wait for the much talked about treatment purchase fund. What good is that to those 2,000 urology patients in Mayo General Hospital or the 1,500 orthopaedic patients who have been waiting for four years?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	223	The Government invested in a new modular theatre for Monaghan Hospital. I said on countless occasions that, while I have no difficulty in increasing surgical activity there, it is not all one-way traffic. It is about time that the stakeholders in the area and the hospital got together and moved on. We have not moved on over the past two years as people found proposals unacceptable and refused even to meet on that basis. That is no way to progress the issue. I have given €2.7 million because I asked the heath board to advise me of the immediate requirement of Monaghan Hospital. I gave it on that basis having asked the health board to inform me what could be done.While we will do more in the hospital, in terms of the organisation of the services, Cavan and Monaghan must work together. This notion that they are both operating in splendid isolation cannot be sustained. Deputy Crawford needs to tell people the truth about that. If we work in that way, we can make progress. If politics were to be taken out of the matter for about six months, something might be sorted out. I say that genuinely.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 29 together.I welcome the publication of this report and thank the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for its time and efforts in its preparation. I have outlined my concerns on the matter of alcohol abuse and on the measures being taken to address this issue in the House on a number of occasions. The strategic focus of my Department as regards alcohol abuse is on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the interim report of the strategic task force on alcohol and on the interdepartmental group established to progress its recommendations.Progress has been made in a number of areas since the publication of the interim report of the task force. In the December 2002 budget, excise duty on spirits was increased. As a result, spirits sales significantly decreased, confirming the international research that increased taxes influence alcohol consumption. It is expected that this decrease in consumption will contribute towards a decrease in alcohol-related harm in the medium term.A number of measures in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 address issues such as serving alcohol to intoxicated customers and so forth. The task force recommended that legislation be introduced to reduce the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol marketing. The heads of a Bill have been agreed by Government and work is ongoing on its preparation.As regards the recommendations calling for research and systematic data collection, my Department has undertaken extensive research on alcohol-related issues. The task force is finalising a second report which will bring forward a further set of recommendations aimed at tackling this problem. However, I have requested officials from my Department to review the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and to identify areas where progress can be made.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I thank the Minister for his reply and wish to ask him about specific recommendations made in this report. One relates to the increase in excise duty on alcopops. The Minister has made the point that increasing excise duty has an impact on consumption. Does he agree with the committee's findings that the excise duty on these products should be increased significantly? In light of his pending legislation, does he agree that there should be an end to alcohol advertising and sports sponsorship? Is he comfortable, for example, with the idea that the GAA accepts so much sponsorship from companies that promote alcohol to such a degree? Is this something he can live with or does he intend to deal with this issue of advertising and sponsorship effectively in his legislation?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	228	In terms of taxation, that in the first instance is a matter for the Minister for Finance.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Does the Minister have an opinion?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	230	We submit representations on an annual basis for increased excise duty on alcohol, especially spirits. As I said in my reply, they were accepted and there was a significant increase in the duty on spirits and alcopops in the budget before last. The reduction in alcopop consumption was dramatic in the aftermath of that budget increase. We took action on that and it resulted in a decline in the sale of spirits in the aftermath of that budget increase.In terms of the advertising issue, I suspect we cannot have a total ban. This is a matter we will explore with the European Commission. Our initial legislative response is to examine advertising in so far as it is directed at young people and children and in so far as they are exposed to wrong advertisements in terms of content. The legislation will affect both the content and timing of the advertisements. These are issues we are examining. It should be borne in mind, however, and I have some experience of this in terms of the tobacco legislation, that the Internal Market pillar of the European Union treaty is strong and not easily circumvented in terms of a total ban on the advertisement of a product such as alcohol. It could be argued, for instance, that one drink is not bad for a person but four or five are. That is the difficulty. These are matters we are exploring with the Office of the Attorney General. I do not believe a total ban is possible.In terms of sponsorship, almost every sport is affected. It is wrong to single out any one sport as regards sponsorship because nearly all major sports have alcohol companies as major sponsors. One can go from the Heineken Cup to the Amstel Champions League to Guinness and the GAA and so on in terms of major sport sponsorship. I am not comfortable with that. My views have been placed on record on regular occasions. Again, we want to concentrate on preventing sponsorship of under age activities and activities in which young people engage. If we can achieve that on the advertising and sponsorship fronts, an important step forward will have been taken.We have commissioned a significant degree of research with general practitioners and with consultants in terms of the accident and emergency situation as regards alcohol issues. It is a matter of getting a better analysis of what is happening among the general population, including those who present at hospitals or visit their GPs. That research will inform further policy developments. We have succeeded in getting the governing bodies of colleges to change their policies and have more proactive alcohol controls on the campuses of many universities. One clear example was where a drinks company sponsored young students to promote, sell and give free alcohol to societies and guilds. That practice has been stopped on our university campuses. There has been an improvement in awareness and so on. We will study the recommendations of the committee and will be pleased to discuss them further.

These include the increase in excise duties, advertising charges, identity cards and a raft of other measures that are reactive. I wonder if he has given any consideration to proactive measures. The Minister for Finance has provided tax breaks to a number of sectors, including for the provision of multi-storey car parks and holiday homes to name just a couple. He cannot inform us of the actual cost these represent to the Exchequer and it would be difficult to measure their social contribution. There would, however, be no question of the social value and contribution of tax incentives for the provision of alternative leisure pursuit opportunities for young people.I invite the Minister to examine this area as regards young people in general and not just those who are under age. It is highlighted repeatedly that there are limited outlets for young people within great swathes of this State. Recommendations to remedy this would include alternative evening leisure pursuits and non-alcohol bar opportunities so that young people would have a choice. I do not believe it will happen just by expecting the economic forces to create it, even if the Progressive Democrats might recommend it. It will need encouragement, direction and support. What is the Minister's response to those points?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I agree there is a need for a proactive approach. We are adopting such an approach. I support the No Name Club, an organisation which engages in the activities mentioned by the Deputy. It is led by the great former Kilkenny hurler, Eddie Keher. The club has set up branches across the country and is quite strong in some counties. We have helped it to appoint permanent co-ordinators. It organises activities for young people, with no alcohol as the key theme, and is working quite well. We need to support such organisations on an ongoing basis. We also need to support abstinence movements which go into schools to educate young people about alcohol, etc.In the educational context, the Walk Tall programme in primary schools has been proactive in introducing a well thought-out and well researched multidisciplinary programme. It introduces children to the benefits of developing strong character and independence of thought and mind. Above all, it teaches children about self-esteem and trust so they can have confidence in themselves. This is particularly important when children are threatened or presented in an environment of peer pressure, with alcohol or other addictive substances.The lottery grant has been superb in bringing about a transformation in sports facilities throughout the country. We cannot keep saying for the next 20 years that things are as bad as they always were, as that is not the case.

The €2 billion that is being wasted every year could be saved if alcohol was used properly. The Minister knows that such funds could be put to good use in many hospitals. The moneys could be used to open the 26 elderly assessment beds which have been lying idle in Mayo General Hospital since 2001, or to do something about the 14 trolleys that are downstairs for older people who are not fit to go to nursing homes. No beds are available for such people who have been sent in by their GPs.

I hope the Minister will state that he favours a total ban on alcohol advertising within two years. It would be a wonderful thing. Is the Minister prepared to allocate the necessary resources to ensure the laws that are in place to tackle alcohol misuse are implemented? I refer to the proposal to recruit 2,000 additional gardaí, for example. The recruitment of so many extra gardaí would do wonders for the situation.

The Minister constantly talks about the promotion of sport, which we read about in the media. I have doubts about the merits of a total prohibition on alcohol advertising. I would like to make a point about the sponsorship of sporting activities. Would it not be fair to signal to organisations which depend on alcohol sponsorship that the days of such sponsorship are coming to an end? If one is to speak about the promotion of sport among young people, it is hypocritical to allow sport to be associated with alcohol.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I wish to discuss the issue of banning this and that. I think Deputy Mitchell is right to signal that the legality of what we do in respect of advertising and sponsorship has to be teased out properly before we make a move in that regard. While it is the case that one of my spokespersons pointed out on my behalf the difficulties of the committee's blanket absolute recommendation that all alcohol advertising be banned, I remind Deputy Cowley that I did not reject anything. There are hurdles to be jumped in terms of EU law. I welcomed the joint committee's report.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	261	An unprecedented level of abuse has flown between Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats members of the Government in the past week. The sight of Fianna Fáil backbenchers on the plinth is nothing new, as they have publicly wrestled with their consciences in recent months in respect of a range of issues, such as cutbacks in community employment schemes, the smoking ban, social welfare cutbacks and stealth taxes. They have provided meek lobby fodder in the House, however, when the Government has voted its business through the Chamber. One occasionally encounters the rare sight of a PD backbencher sighing publicly about issues such as freedom of information, electronic voting or something else that is about to upset the national psyche.The business of slagging has reached unprecedented levels in the past week, involving Ministers from the same Cabinet. The Constitution sets out clearly that members of the Government are "collectively responsible" for the Departments they administer. Such collective responsibility now appears to be in shreds. The human punchbag for the Government is in the House today to soak up and absorb all the treatment being meted out to it.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	288	——the commitment of the Government to ensure that programme is completed and the steps that will be taken, with the best efforts that could be made in the Garda College in Templemore, to meet that target. Already, 589 of the hospital beds promised have been provided and there is an ongoing commitment from the Minister for Health and Children on additional resources to ensure that the necessary ground will be made up in the provision of hospital beds as soon as possible.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Hold on to your trolley.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	291	He is hypnotised.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The Minister spoke about social inclusion and said that the Government is in favour of social inclusion. Did he consider, at that businesslike meeting this morning, that a man in Tallaght left his cubicle to go to the toilet only to find his bed gone when he came back? At that businesslike meeting this morning, did he consider that 150 patients are lying on trolleys in accident and emergency units? Did he consider at that meeting the thousands of parents who are waiting for psychological assessments for their children and that, in the case of parents to whom psychological assessments have been provided, the national educational psychological service branch of the Department of Education and Science is unable to process their applications and they do not know whether they will have full care assistance in September? So much for social inclusion in the Government's businesslike meeting.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	294	When will we have a situation where Cabinet responsibility applies and where the people elected to Government stop squabbling among themselves when they know the people are out to get them? The Minister should answer the questions. Will the Minister confirm that the Government will employ the 2,000 extra gardaí in its lifetime?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I ask the Deputy to give way to the Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Will he confirm the allocation of 200,000 extra medical cards and that 3,000 extra beds will be provided and not left in units that are built but unopened? He is a disgrace.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	297	This Government, and the previous Government, would put the previous Administration to shame.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	298	The people will put the Minister to shame.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	301	It would put that Administration to shame in terms of what has been attempted to be done for the people with special needs. Whether one is talking about special assistance, resource teachers, remedial teachers, the provision of long-stay facilities or respite care——

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	305	——in every one of those areas, the Government puts that Administration to shame.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	306	There are 51 Down's syndrome children waiting for special needs assistance.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I would be the first to admit there is still more to be done.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	309	We will continue to dedicate additional resources to these special needs areas. It is a high priority for the Government but I will not be lectured by parties which put £1 million into capital resources for special needs in their last year of Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	310	A phoney war. The Minister should not talk about social inclusion.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	316	——we have increased the number of specialists in the emergency areas. We are trying to provide additional step-down facilities. We know the medical services have to be improved in these areas. We are understanding and sympathetic and we want to provide additional resources for these areas——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	329	This is a sovereign Parliament, a Cheann Comhairle, and we can manage fine——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Yes, Deputy, and the Members lay down Standing Orders. If Members continue to abuse the Standing Order, there is no option but to find another way in which we can implement the Standing Order as laid down by the Members of the House.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Did you ever consider closing down the House altogether, Sir? We will meet for the budget once a year.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	332	That is a matter for the Members of the House also.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	333	A good idea.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	334	That is the way many Government backbenchers treat it. I want to ask the Minister about the new caring face of Fianna Fáil that is trying to break out all over the place. What exactly does it mean in terms of the implementation of the Hanly report? Will the Hanly report be implemented à la the Minister for Health and Children or will it be abridged and aborted in line with this Minister’s thinking? Which will it be? I ask the question specifically in regard to the implications of the Hanly report for accident and emergency services throughout the country and in the context of the point made by Deputy Kenny when he averted to the fact that a man in my constituency who got off a trolley to go to the toilet came back and found the trolley was gone.In this region yesterday, 150 patients were on trolleys. There were 30 patients on trolleys in Naas hospital alone, with 40 beds closed, a shortage of nurses and nurses in that hospital on work to rule. What are the implications of this state of chaos for the new caring Fianna Fáil that is about to break out were it not for the Progressive Democrats? The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told the country this morning that our economy is the envy of Europe. Our health services are not the envy of Europe. What is the point of economic growth if we are to endure health services like these? Will the Minister indicate exactly what the new social democratic wing of Fianna Fáil says it should do with Hanly if it could get the Progressive Democrats off its back? What are the implications for patients lying on trolleys in the circumstances described in this morning's newspapers, a phenomenon that existed once or twice during peak winter periods in the past but which now appears to be a regular feature throughout the year?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	335	First, there is no new social democratic wing in Fianna Fáil. As for the Fianna Fáil record on helping the poor, increasing pensions and providing funds for those who are in need, we will stand our record against that of any political party in this House, and we will continue to do that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	336	What about widows?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	337	The Progressive Democrats are to blame.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Second, of course there is a need for economic development because it is the economic development and growth in our economy that affords us the opportunity——
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	339	What is the Government doing about Hanly?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	340	Allow me to answer the question. The Deputy raised a number of questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	341	The time is up. Switch off the microphone.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	342	It is the economic development and growth in our economy that affords us the opportunity to deal with these questions.The numbers of people on hospital trolleys and the problems in accident and emergency services are unacceptable. That is the reason the number of accident and emergency specialists has increased from 14 in 1997 to 51, including ten in Dublin, bringing the number there to 21, to try to grapple with the problems associated with accident and emergency services.Other services, such as those provided by GPs, need to be developed to ensure that only appropriate admissions are made to accident and emergency departments. Step-down services for patients in acute beds must also be developed to free up beds. Accident and emergency departments must also be expanded and developed.With regard to the Hanly report, the Minister for Health and Children and I have already indicated to the House the core principles of improving the structures of the health services through providing more consultants to the regions and the provision of services that have hitherto not been available. At the same time, local communities must be listened to to ensure accident and emergency services are provided in regional hospitals on a 24-hour basis and improvements in existing services.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	343	This is in total contradiction to what is actually in the Hanly report. From the Minister's answer, I take it that the report's recommendations are now dead. Will the Minister specifically address the problems in accident and emergency service provision? After seven years in office, it is unacceptable, even with its new social democratic and caring face, that there are approximately 100,000 fewer medical cards in the system. The reality is that while in the economically difficult days of the 1980s approximately 40% of the population had medical cards, the figure is now only 29.6%. I do not want to raise the other social welfare cuts such as rent allowance.If that is the social democratic and caring face of Fianna Fáil, no wonder it is concentrating its fire on choreographed press statements, well-signalled in advance to the newspapers, attacking the Progressive Democrats. This focus on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will only undermine his already fragile self-confidence. It will not improve the lot of those using accident and emergency wards.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The Government is always working to increase the qualifying limits for medical cards.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	345	The Government has not done this.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	346	It has done the opposite.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I am proud that approximately 400,000 more people are now at work than in 1997. Their incomes are such that they are in a better position to cater for themselves.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	348	They cannot afford to get sick.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	352	That thrust of economic development takes more people out of the poverty trap. It gets them into jobs, allowing them the better opportunity to look after themselves.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	353	Of course the Government will not give them a medical card.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	354	The Government is spending it all on State dinners for all its pals coming over from Europe.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I might be looking for the Minister's job. He should be careful about it but then it was saved before.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	362	It must be remembered that we are talking about people, not statistics. A man with a degenerative heart condition was recently admitted to Tallaght Hospital where he spent three full days on a trolley before getting a bed. He was then discharged 45 minutes later. In the course of waiting, while having to attend the toilet, his trolley was taken. These are traumatic experiences for ordinary people. Many of those lying in trolleys in hospital corridors, not just in the eastern region but throughout the country, are subjected to difficult experiences. Older people are robbed of their dignity while young people visiting are unnerved, even frightened, when going past these streams of trolleys with sick people.What steps is the Government taking to address this problem? Is the Government increasing bed provision or providing additional staff? What nursing staff have to contend with at the coalface of the delivery of acute services is unacceptable. We do not want reports constantly cited to us in answer to these questions but evidence of what the Government is actually doing to address these issues. With an upturn in the economy, there are no excuses for failing to address these needs.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	363	No objective analysis of health services can claim this Government has failed to invest in them.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	368	In the last seven years in the health services, the number of additional nurses has increased to 8,200 and the number of additional consultants stands at 491. The number of patients treated in-hospital and at out-patient facilities has increased by over 250,000. In 2003, 47,000 additional patients were treated in hospitals between in-patient and out-patient facilities. That marks an increase of 4.7%.I understand the pressures on accident and emergency wards. I have already indicated the number of additional consultants that have been employed and the additional facilities provided. Step-down facilities and improvements in GP services must be developed to ensure that patients are screened to ensure accident and emergency facilities are available for the acutely ill.In Tallaght Hospital, the nine cubicles in the accident and emergency ward have a high turnover. Many patients arrive without prior notice and many need resuscitation and other urgent assistance to save their lives. In the event of a life-threatening admission, it is normal for a patient to be moved to another bed or trolley after assessment so that space can be freed up. Due to different patient types, this is part of the work of many accident and emergency departments in major hospitals. I accept that the number of patients on trolleys is unacceptable. However, additional resources are being dedicated in a wide range of areas to combat that problem.

How many more are on trolleys in other regional acute hospitals? Nothing in what the Minister has said will address their need today. Make no mistake, it could be the Minister's or my need tomorrow. This is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed.In the Fianna Fáil 2002 general election manifesto, a promise, often overlooked while others are cited, was made that the Government intended to implement a full range of measures to improve accident and emergency services by significantly reducing waiting times and having senior doctors available at all times. The Government has failed to live up to this promise. The promises regarding an additional 200,000 medical cards and the ending of waiting lists are often cited. However, this is another promise that brought this Government into power. While the House discusses this issue, the Government is offering no redress to the situation in which many people find themselves. Will the Minister outline how he proposes to address the policy deficiencies of this Government?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	370	A sum of €17.6 million has been allocated to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system to more appropriate settings. This funding has already resulted in the discharge of some 300 patients from acute hospitals in the eastern region. Funding has been provided for the recruitment of additional emergency medicine consultants and consultant anaesthetists. There are now 51 emergency medicine consultant posts in acute hospitals and the number of emergency medicine consultants in the eastern region has increased from ten to 21. A sum of €46.5 million has been allocated for the development of general practitioner out of hours co-operatives between 2000 and 2003, with an additional €24 million being provided in 2004. These additional resources are clearly making an impact. All the problems have not been resolved and the Minister for Health and Children will continue his efforts and will be supported strongly in the Government to get the additional resources which will ultimately deal with the remaining problems which need to be addressed.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m. Nos. 12 and 13 shall be decided without debate, and in the case of No. 13 [Votes 1 to 27 and 30 to 38] shall be moved together and shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith. The proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 17 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. Private Members' business shall be No. 39, motion re Nitrates Directive.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I have no objection to No. 12. In respect of No. 13 will the Minister for Defence say if Vote No. 20 dealing with the Garda Síochána Revised Estimates includes sufficient moneys for extra recruitment for this year, and can he explain the numbers of the 2000 extra that will include?Regarding Vote No. 33 for Revised Estimate for the Department of Health and Children, is there sufficient money there, in addition to the salaries and expenses for the office of the Minister, to deal with the matter of opening 3000 hospital beds promised by the Government, and the allocation of 200,000 extra medical cards?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	379	Regarding No. 20, it would be prudent to give the House an opportunity to discuss these two Estimates in particular, but not only those. Many Members of the House did not have an opportunity to contribute on Committee Stage. In one of his more recent press releases the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has suggested that he will after all recruit a number of gardaí. I do not know how much money will be permitted for this by the provision, nor do I know why it must be taken without debate.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	380	In common with many people the Green Party also wishes to have this matter debated in the House. The lack of Garda resources is regularly brought to our attention. We are also mindful of the need for a more comprehensive report to come before the House regarding proposals which are not being debated by Government. No. 12 highlights this aspect. It would be interesting to have more details on what is proposed. It paints quite a macabre picture of admitting third country nationals "for the purposes of scientific research" when one does not have the background. It is important that we are aware of what is being proposed here before giving it the go-ahead.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	381	No. 12 is somewhat regrettably worded. I wonder if it could have been better presented than "third country nationals for purpose of scientific research". I would not be surprised if this accorded with some of the views current on the Government benches.Regarding the Revised Estimate proposals, I join colleagues in urging that they be addressed in full and open debate and not passed without debate. The point was made earlier that an insufficient number of Deputies got the opportunity to participate in the recent Private Members business that directed attention regarding the need for further supports for the Garda presence throughout the country. Many local stations, particularly rural stations are under threat, and closures are taking place. I support the views expressed and urge the Government to accede to the request to allow for these proposals to be debated.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	382	There is a procedure in this House for dealing with these matters in this way. There is an opportunity for every Deputy in the House to contribute in the committee where these matters are fully debated. In Private Members' business last week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform reiterated the Government's commitment to the recruitment of additional gardaí and noted that Garda numbers this year would be at an all-time high of 12,200. I will try to get the details of the numbers to be recruited, but I understand the figure is about 700.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 17, conclusion of Second Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill 2004, agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	384	In accordance with long-standing practice in this House I object on behalf of the Fine Gael party to a guillotine in this case. In recent weeks I have had extensive material submitted to my office from concerned persons and organisations regarding matters related to the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill. There is particular reference to the building of a major motorway in County Meath which is of interest to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey. It is interesting that prior to the last general election, the National Roads Authority was of the opinion that the N4, the road west, could not be developed because of the national monument site at Rath Crucacháin in Roscommon, whereas there appears to be a very different view regarding the Hill of Tara. In that sense there are matters Deputies would wish to discuss. I object to the use of the guillotine on this matter.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	385	This is significant legislation under which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be given the power to order the demolition, destruction or even export of pieces of our national heritage. It is proposed that we conclude Second Stage of the Bill tonight at 10 p.m. The Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government has scheduled, at the Government's request as I understand it, the Bill to commence Committee Stage at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow. What is the rush? The Supreme Court decision which gave rise to the Bill was handed down last February. The Bill was concealed before the local elections and published only on the day of those elections. What is the rush to conclude Second Stage by 10 p.m. and to begin Committee Stage little more than 12 hours later without sufficient time for preparation of amendments?I draw to the attention of the House that Report Stage of the long awaited Residential Tenancies Bill, which I am delighted is restored to the Order Paper, is scheduled to be taken in the House at the same time as Committee Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill. Clearly those of us dealing with these Bills cannot be in two places at one time. Therefore, could we at least have an assurance from the Government that Committee Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, which is due to take place tomorrow, will be deferred until Report Stage of the Residential Tenancies Bill has been dealt with in the House?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	386	While I can understand why the Government would want to guillotine the Bill, that does not mean it is the best thing to do in the interests of the heritage of the country. The Government should reconsider this. After filleting Dúchas and repeatedly demoralising those involved with conservation, the Minister is now taking enormous powers unto himself. His discretion to date has not given great confidence that he would use those powers in any responsible way or in a way that would ensure the long-term interests of our heritage. I ask that Members of the House be allowed the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, which will have serious knock-on effects. It should not be guillotined. Pushing a vote at 10 p.m. would be the ultimate insult to the interests of heritage in this country.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	387	This Bill, if adopted, will have far-reaching consequences for many heritage sites throughout the country. It is absolutely unacceptable that it should be guillotined. As other speakers have said, a number of important sites of national interest are under direct or indirect threat, and there will be many others as plans unfold in the years ahead. Members, with their local knowledge of the various constituencies throughout the jurisdiction, should be given full opportunity to participate on Second Stage of the Bill. I strongly object to the imposition of a guillotine at this time. The Government should reconsider this. It is not in the interests of proper debate and due attention to the importance and seriousness of what is involved in the proposition within the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill. Again, I record my opposition to the guillotine.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	388	We have already had four and half hours of debate and I understand there will be three additional hours this evening.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	390	It is well known that the resources dedicated to the protection of our heritage and the number of additional personnel employed in recent years have been significant. The House can be assured the Bill will protect that heritage in every way possible.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	391	When will the legislation on citizenship arising from the referendum be published and debated? Arising from the Electoral Act, there are reports from throughout the country that, when the counts were being conducted following the recent elections, some ballot boxes had numbers of perfectly valid ballot papers which were not perforated. Should the Government not issue an instruction to all returning officers that the presiding officers in question should not be re-employed in view of the failure to deliver their constitutional rights to citizens who cast their votes properly but whose votes were not counted because the ballot papers were not perforated for whatever reason?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	392	That legislation will be published in the autumn. I accept the Deputy's point. It is regrettable that this occurs. All Members have experienced it. There is no acceptable explanation for that type of negligence, and it is negligence. I will undertake to discuss the matter with the appropriate Minister and also discuss the steps that can be taken to eliminate it as far as possible. That is the least that should be done. There are other matters regarding spoilt ballot papers which can be discussed on another day. However, the problem outlined by the Deputy should be avoidable.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I earlier voiced my concern that the constant sniping from Fianna Fáil would undermine the self-confidence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Has the Minister for Defence given any thought to my proposition last week that the House sit late in July to facilitate the clearing out of some of the dead wood in the Cabinet and allow the new Government to be put in place?

Does the Government plan to publish the report of the commission on electronic voting? It has promised to do so but has a date been set for publication? There is a need to get to the bottom of this faux pas and to put in place a proper voting system that is accountable and transparent.With regard to the Civil Service regulation (amendment) Bill, there has been a call from IMPACT for the establishment of an independent body to consult stakeholders on decisions about the decentralisation programme. Is there any possibility of acceding to that request in advance of publication of the legislation——

I welcome the thrust of the Bill as presented to the House. During the debate on the Bill last week, one of the finest contributions was made by a Member from the opposite side who explained her support for the Bill clearly, succinctly and reasonably.For approximately 16 years I was a member of the national monuments committee of Cork County Council. The committee was set up in 1985. It is a great pity that more councils throughout the country did not follow our example in setting up such a committee. In 1985, despite a meagre budget of £25,000, we did tremendous work. There were a number of non-elected members on the committee — people with a particular interest in archaeology, the environment and monuments generally. I will not give their names, but their contribution was immense. We travelled to Goleen, Barryscourt and other places where amazing work was done in designating national monuments and so on. If that model was followed by other counties, the problems we face today may not have occurred. I am not aware of any other local authority that has a national monument committee, and that is regrettable.In every electoral division in Cork the committee considered archaeological sites of all types, including forts, churches and old castles, such as Castle Donovan in west Cork. Places of interest were logged and mapped and records were kept by Cork County Council. Whenever a development was carried out the local planners were aware of artefacts, monuments or sites of archaeological importance that might be impinged upon and the county council was given advance warning.This Bill is the result of the Minister's duty to find a balance between development and conservation. Motorways and water and sewerage schemes need to be built and a balance must be found in the interest of the common good. I chaired the Joint Committee on the Constitution during its consideration of property rights and one of the main themes that emerged was the common good. Should projects be delayed in the interest of the common good? If we are to be parochial, we could take the example of the snail that held up construction of the Kildare bypass. In my area, a water scheme has been held up since 1985, when a public hearing took place at which the then Department of the Environment and Local Government decided to reschedule the scheme because of a water lily. The scheme was later moved at great expense and delay. The Minister has allocated funds for it and, I hope, building will be commenced shortly. In another area the discovery of an otters' bed resulted in an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, which resulted in further delays.There are 20,000 people in Cork whose water supply is inadequate. This scheme is being held up because of certain extreme elements. The water lily concerned has since vanished of its own accord after costing the Department several million euro. I looked for the otters' bed in a location near the sea and a local man in his late 70s told me he had not seen an otter in the area for more than 40 years. Sometimes we need to get a grip on reality.This Bill focuses on the problems created by the Carrickmines Castle site. Of course we must take into account the importance of archaeological and heritage sites such as this. However, there are similar sites everywhere in the country because of our ancient heritage. We must decide on these in the interest of the country and the people who live here. We must protect our heritage without going too far.This Bill gives the Minister power to make a direction in certain circumstances. This is a sensible provision. Somebody must grasp the nettle. If there are delays which cost the taxpayer millions, the Minister is accused on the one hand of delaying projects and on the other of not protecting the environment. Somewhere in between there must be a fair balance. The Minister must be lauded for achieving that balance in the Bill. I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for almost 11 years and I have seen Ministers hammered over delayed projects. Questions are raised such as why this or that water scheme is not going ahead, why there is no major sewerage scheme and why this or that motorway is not finished.One will find some item of archaeological interest in every part of Ireland if one digs. In my area, the Sheep's Head Peninsula, there is a hill-walking committee called Slí Muintir Bheara, with which I am involved. With the help of people who are enthusiastic about going on walks and investigating historical sites, we discovered, with advice from experts in UCC, what we thought was a cláirín of stones on top of a mountain called Seefin. This turned out to be a megalithic tomb which, it was later confirmed, dates back to 2000 BC. We discovered two or three more of these in the Beara Peninsula. The town of Castletownbere was built facing towards the mountains for fear of attack from the sea. Sensible people will support the protection of important archaeological finds.I do not have figures but perhaps when replying the Minister might indicate the cost in economic terms of delays during the past seven years since this Government took office. What were the legal costs of going to court? I do not deny that people have a right to object. In this instance, An Bord Pleanála was involved and will continue to play a role. However, I would like the Minister to give some indication, not necessarily today but perhaps some time before the Bill is concluded, of the cost to the taxpayer of delays in proceeding with projects such as the N11, the Dundalk by-pass or the Kildare by-pass. There was fierce criticism following the spending of millions of euro on electronic voting but, listening to today's debate, people probably regret that it was not introduced. However, it will be introduced at some stage. What we want to know is the real cost associated with delays to such developments as the M50.To people who might say I am anti-environment, I am not taking away from the argument put forward regarding the importance of the historical Carrickmines Castle. However, the completion of that part of the M50 is of critical importance not alone to people living in and commuting to Dublin but to the whole country. We need a network of motorways, and we have made significant progress throughout the country. However, we are some years behind the European model which has a network of road and rail, and particularly motorways, throughout developed Europe.Motorways and infrastructure developments are planned for many years. The plans for the Cork-Dublin motorway have been in existence for the past two decades. The plans for the M50 have also been in existence for a long time. The Supreme Court granted an injunction against Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council in relation to the Carrickmines site. The court was unhappy with the current legislation. Consequently the Minister was obliged to bring in this amendment Act of 2004 to get around the difficulty.The Bill will make provision for appropriate protection of our archaeological heritage along the routes of approved road developments, including the south-eastern section of the M50. It is not a case of giving the Minister carte blanche to drive motorways and pipelines through any part of Ireland with absolute disregard for our heritage, our archaeological sites and national monuments. I congratulate the Fine Gael spokesperson who spoke on this last week. I reject the notion being bandied about by some parties that this Government has no desire to protect the environment and our heritage. Nothing could be further from the truth.Historically, one person who promoted our heritage and national monuments and was one of the leading lights in this regard was former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey. He was particularly supportive of the national monuments committee in the mid-1980s, a time when finances were strapped. I was a member of that committee for a number of years. It was a cross-party committee representative of all sides. Its budget was increased to close to €0.5 million. It is still quite small, but the committee works in conjunction with the OPW, another State agency, and the council. In all the areas we visited throughout the county, from Mitchelstown and Youghal to west Cork, the support of local engineers and the consultation process were second to none. It galls me to hear the current Government accused of lack of interest in heritage. Over the past 20 to 25 years of my political life, going back to my student days, this Government has always had a very strong handle on and a realistic and common-sense approach to the environment. I want to emphasise that the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey was one of the most outspoken in his support for preserving our heritage and national monuments. The work he did then was ahead of his time and I want to acknowledge his significant contribution.The Joint Committee on the Constitution, which I chaired, examined the issue of property rights in the context of infrastructure and so on. That committee was composed of members from all parties. Its deliberations were delayed for a couple of months in order to allow in other small groups — Sinn Féin, the Independent group and the Green Party. The committee came to certain conclusions which were supported by an eminent constitutional lawyer, Mr. Gerard Hogan. It was clearly of the view that Article 43 of the Constitution, which was set up in 1937 by the then Government and President, allowed for what it called the common good. We must consider the common good when building motorways. In some instances we are inclined to disregard it. The traffic problems involved in building motorways cause us all headaches and stress, but we must build them. We must make sensible provision, but we cannot allow every inch of the way to be stopped by protesters and court action and so on. If that happens we will need to do a serious economic analysis of the loss to the taxpayer that results when various projects are delayed. We are now in an era of great economic growth. Significant progress has been made in the past decade or so. This growth may not exist in ten or 15 years. We must, therefore, proceed while we have that advantage and take into account that in our booming economy traffic counts were never higher. I examined figures relating to the period from the middle 1980s to 2000, which show that the volume of traffic on our roads quadrupled. That created its own problems.I want to put it on record that this is a caring and forward-thinking Minister. He must grasp the nettle. Thinking about the famous lily which upset our water supply in Bantry and has since died, the Minister must gild the lily, move forward and make sensible provision. This Bill does not give the Minister draconian powers. He will not be able to drive a coach and four through the legislation. The Bill contains safeguards. There is provision for a consultation process, and the issue may also be taken up by An Bord Pleanála. In a nutshell, the Bill allows the Minister to make decisions and give directions. I am certain that such decisions will not be taken lightly. We have a country whose young people are well educated and cognisant of our heritage, archaeology and monuments and they want to protect them.Coming from an area which is very dependent on tourism, particularly places such as west Cork and Kerry, I have noted the numbers of people who now visit our country from mainland Europe and America and even China and the Far East.Coming from an area which is very dependent on tourism, particularly places such as west Cork and Kerry, I have noted the numbers of people who now visit our country from mainland Europe and America and even China and the Far East. These visitors come here to explore our fairly unspoiled heritage. Barryscourt Castle in east Cork, which is run by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in conjunction with the OPW, is an excellent example of a castle which was falling into decay and which has now mushroomed. It has been protected and there is now an information centre there. The last time I was there one could look around and have a coffee in the coffee shop. That type of facility is the product of successful, caring Governments. I have already mentioned Charles J. Haughey but over the last few years successive Governments have not turned their back on the environment. I will take issue with anyone on that.I support this Bill. It is necessary and we must take account of the common good in the development of this country. We must not delay forever large developments like the M50 or the eastern link road by neglecting the common good. It will cost the taxpayer a lot of money and it will cause many headaches for the general public. If it were to come to a plebiscite of the people of Dublin, they would want to protect their heritage, they would take account of the archaeological findings, but progress has to be made.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	435	Many of those who visit from abroad come to take in our history, culture and heritage. Many of the American tourists that I meet around Cork city would be off to Florida if they were looking for the sun. The Europeans that come from Germany and Italy would be in the Costa del Sol or the Algarve. They come to enjoy the richness of our history and heritage. They even endure the rip-off Ireland culture that is there so that they can enjoy that history and culture. As a result, it is even more important that a Bill of this nature is given the scrutiny and examination it requires. I resent the fact that it is being guillotined this evening at 10 p.m. with a vote. I also resent that it will go to Committee Stage tomorrow, at a time when the Residential Tenancies Bill 2004 is on Report Stage. We do not have the gift of bilocation so there is the possibility of a clash between the consideration of both Bills. The Minister has his two able Ministers of State. The deputy spokesman on the environment in my party, Deputy McCormack, will deal with one of them. However, it is important that this Bill not be rushed and that it be given the consideration it deserves. Even though the Bill has many merits, the reservations raised by many outside the House deserve examination and scrutiny. It is unwise of the Minister to guillotine this Bill and to rush it through Committee Stage tomorrow. There should be no presumption that this Bill will be passed tonight but the Government has arrogantly tabled Committee Stage for tomorrow as it is confident in its weight of numbers.The publication of this Bill arises from a decision made in the courts last January and since then I have been told that the situation has deteriorated in the Carrickmines area. Putting forward this Bill, the Minister had to deal not only with the Carrickmines issue but the possibility of many other cases arising in the near future such as the M3 and the troubles that may arise at Tara and the N25 which is the Waterford city bypass in the Minister's own backyard. The problem that has arisen in Carrickmines has given rise to a significant cost for the local authority, the taxpayer and every commuter, resident and business. The court judgment has had significant implications not only for Carrickmines but for every other road development in the future. The role of the National Roads Authority has been questioned by previous speakers and the cost implications were reflected in the news yesterday that the N8 Rathcormac and Fermoy bypass is one of 11 new public private fee paying schemes being developed by the NRA.It is estimated that €300 million will be paid in tolls each year by motorists who will finance these projects. I find it hard to accept that taxpayers who have paid income tax, road taxes and many stealth taxes introduced in the last 12 months, will now be caught again by the tolling of these roads. That will add to the competitiveness difficulties experienced by our businesses and industries. This Bill is also being discussed against a background of damage to a major prehistoric coastal fort on the Dingle Peninsula. The heritage section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government ordered an assessment of the damage done to that major prehistoric coastal fort after part of the linear fortification earthwork was flattened during what is believed to be land reclamation activities.I am asking the Minister to state why there is no ministerial preservation order on the Dún Mor Fort, a major coastal fort in use from 1000 BC until the early Christian period. I understand the monument is listed as a national monument but that no agreement is in place on how the land could be farmed around the monument without interference with the fort. The Department has claimed that new legislation will be introduced shortly which will see a root and branch overhaul of existing legislation on the protection of monuments and how the protection may be enforced, especially in view of the fact that all but 1% of recorded monuments are on private land. When will we see legislation to address these issues and how will the legislation address the issue of the protection of national monuments on private land? What is the situation regarding the standing stone with ogham inscriptions in the fort situated on about 80 acres and which is possibly the largest coastal fort in Ireland?This Bill is not a comprehensive Bill but at the same time it has provoked conflicting reactions. The Bill gives An Bord Pleanála the power to sanction variations to approved works and where it does not so sanction, a decision can be made on the need for a new environmental impact study rather than waiting for the courts to adjudicate on the matter. Our national monuments need to be preserved because we must value our history and our past and our national monuments should only be interfered with where there is no alternative. When a situation arises where a unique and irreplaceable monument of archaeological value and significance is discovered, an alternative route for a proposed road must be found. As has already been stated by Deputy Olivia Mitchell who is familiar with the situation in Carrickmines as it is in her area, the core of the dispute is whether what was discovered is archaeologically unique or merely of historical interest. The problem, as she has pointed out, is the designation of what constitutes a national monument. How is a national monument designated?The Minister referred to the archaeological remains at Carrickmines as a national monument. This classification has never been accepted by the county council and there was no one to adjudicate on it. One side of the dispute claimed it was a national monument while the county council stated it was not. However, in the absence of objective criteria, the council was put in an impossible position of having to apply for consent to interfere with a national monument. Despite no official classification, the county council applied for permission to interfere with the historical remains at Carrickmines, the Minister gave his consent, it was appealed to the courts and the appeal was upheld on a technicality which had nothing to do with the merits of the case.A major flaw of this Bill is that it does not deal with the designation of a monument and therefore leaves every road project open to the accusations that its path goes through a national monument. The designation of a national monument must therefore be clarified. Comprehensive legislation is urgently needed and we are not too sure when it will be brought before this House.Given the unsatisfactory and uncertain nature of the situation, it is the responsibility of all agencies dealing with projects involving taxpayers' money to ensure that the initial investigation and the environmental impact assessment are comprehensive and conclusive to avoid a repeat of what we witnessed in Carrickmines. Like the balance that should be in place between industrial development and protection of our environment, there should be no tension between infrastructural development and preserving our heritage. We must have balance in the issue. Our national monuments, which are unique and irreplaceable, must be preserved and alternative routes found for our roads.I thought the Bill would attempt to lay out clearly the procedures for dealing with discoveries despite that the designation of those discoveries is still not clear. However, since then I have received a copy of an opinion on the Bill which should and must be read into the record. The Minister has a major responsibility to reply to the issues raised by the opinion of senior counsel, Frank Callanan, on the Bill. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to read into the record the full opinion, but I will deal with some aspects of it which I believe require a response. It states:The National Monuments (Amendment) Bill 2004 has a number of immediately striking objectionable features as a piece of proposed legislation. That does not mean that there are not others which are not immediately apparent but are fully intended by the Minister and this renders both the speed of it and the lack of consultation surrounding this legislation reprehensible if not sinister. [They are strong words.] The Minister of course seeks to justify the speed of this Act's introduction to the situation prevailing at Carrickmines.The Bill is however not limited to Carrickmines nor is it even limited to what might be called crisis management in the construction of roads. It is profound and radical change to the provisions of the existing national monuments legislation for the protection of national monuments in Ireland contained in the National Monuments Acts 1930-1994.The legislation reflects a long standing consensus in Ireland in relation to the treatment of national monuments not merely among political parties but among the broad community of officials and experts concerned with the preservation of Ireland's archaeological and historical heritage. It is proposed to dismantle that consensus without permitting a proper national or even parliamentary discussion. This legislative scheme is almost as old as the Irish state. The Minister has advanced no grounds to justify what might itself in legislative terms be characterised as an act of vandalism. No justification except of course Carrickmines...One might have expected that in relation to a major legislative change of this kind the Minister as part of a process of public consultation would have produced some form of comparative study as to how other European states address these issues. He will not do so no doubt for the very good reason that it would expose the gross deficiencies of this legislative scheme...The proposed amendment to section 14 of the principal Act by substitution of the criteria on which the Minister is to exercise his discretion so that it is not limited to archaeological considerations is utterly retrograde and removes any settled basis of the exercise of a ministerial discretion ... Again, this goes far beyond the Carrickmines issue to which the Minister ceaselessly harks back and seeks to pre-empt legal challenge across the range of national monuments. It is the evisceration of the protection conferred by the existing Act. The Act is concerned with the removal of both legislative and judicial safeguards. It is, as legislation, deeply irresponsible, and is quite likely to have the effect of involving the courts in the determination of controversial issues which ought never to have arisen and to have been addressed by some form of legislatively created arbitral process.As stated earlier I do not have time to read into the record the full opinion but it further states:The hands of An Bord Pleanála are tightly bound in making its determination that a material alteration is likely to have significant adverse effect on the environment by Schedule 2. An Bord Pleanála has no role in relation to the national monuments aspect of the matter other than to have regard to 'landscapes of historical cultural or archaeological significance.' So, the one apparent institutional check on the Minister is nullified, apparently intentionally, in relation to the national monuments aspect.Will the Minister explain why he did not address the issues described by the courts as technical hitches or glitches rather than introduce a Bill which has greater implications for infrastructural development and the preservation of national monuments? Beyond the Carrickmines issue, the Bill diminishes the protection appended to national monuments and removes safeguards. Is this the price we must pay for the serial litigants intent on delaying progress on every major infrastructural project? In other words, are we using a sledgehammer to crack a nut?

Níl an tAire sásta éisteacht, agus níor éist séó thosaigh an díospóireacht seo. Tá sé scannalach nach bhfuil sé sásta éisteacht sa Teach seo ar cheist na seandálaíochta agus na hoidhreachta. Téir suas go Teamhair, agus scrios í. Téir síos go Port Láirge, agus scrios an suíomh nua sin. Is é sin an meon scannalach atá ag an Aire — corruption. Tá sé ceangailte go huile is go hiomlán leis an dream atá ag scriosadh na tíre seo agus ag baint airgid as. Is é caimiléireacht go huile is go hiomlán atá ag baint leis, mar níl aon fháth eile leis an reachtaíocht seo ach go bhfuil caimiléireacht taobh thiar de. Bhí caimiléireacht taobh thiar de na rudaí a tharla i dTroim.

Ba chaimiléireacht go huile is go hiomlán é, agus tharla sé sin sa chathair seo maidir le Cé an Adhmaid. Caimiléireacht a bhí ann sin, agus bhí caimiléireacht i gceist i gCarraig Mhaighin. Níl aon fháth go mbeadh Jackson Way bainteach leis seo, ach tá sé, mar tá caimiléireacht ann, agus tá muintir pháirtí an Aire gafa leis go huile is go hiomlán. Ba chóir dó seasamh suas agus náire a bheith air. Ba chóir dóéirí as a phost. Is é ard atáá dhéanamh aige ná comhshaol, stair agus oidhreacht na tíre seo a scriosadh. Níl muidinne sásta glacadh leis sin, agus ní ligfidh muid dóé sin a dhéanamh. Ní ligfidh muid dó i dTeamhair. Ní ligfear dó i gCarraig Mhaighin. Tógfar cásanna eile cúirte, agus cuirfear moill air.

Tá airgead taobh thiar de seo, agus sin an cheist nach bhfuil sé sásta a fhreagairt. Tá sé sásta bheith ina sheasamh ansin ag screadaíl orm, mar tá mé ag insint na fírinne; níl seisean. Mar a dúirt mé faoin Teamhair, tá sé ag iarraidh bóthar mór a chur tríd. Dúradh ag an am nach raibh ach dhá shuíomh seandálaíochta ann. Cheana féin, tá breis agus 28 suíomh nua faighte timpeall an cheantair sin. Ba cheart don Aire an plean a athrú seachas dul i ngleic le oidhreacht na tíre seo. Ba cheart dóí agus a leithéid de Charraig Mhaighin a chaomhnú. Tiocfaidh na turasóirí, mar sin an fáth go dtagann siad go dtí an tír seo sa chéad dul síos. Seachas é sin a dhéanamh, áfach, cuireann an tAire coincréit air. Seans go dtiocfaidh postanna as sin ar feadh cúig bliana. Má dhéanaimid caomhnú agus cur chun cinn ar ár n-oidhreacht agus ár seandálaíocht, beidh níos mó turasoirí ag teacht go dtí an tír seo. Beidh níos mó daoine ag teacht. Ba cheart don Aire smaoineamh.

Cad é a tharlóidh má fhaightear rud nua amuigh i gCarraig Mhaighin i gceann míosa nó dhó? Ní bheidh cead ag an musaem dul ann, mar tá an tAire gafa go hiomlán le caimiléireacht. Cé mhéad breabanna atá an tAire agus daoine cosúil leis tar éis glacadh? Tá daoine ar an taobh sin den Teach ag glacadh breabanna le 30, 40 agus 80 bliain.

Tá an tAire maslach. Níl sé sásta mé a fhreagairt i nGaeilge, fiú, ach níl sí aige, mar níl spéis nó suim aige i stair nó oidhreacht na tíre seo. Tá sé maslach agus náireach. Imíodh leis.

The tribunal is doing its work. These people are connected with the Minister's party, not my party. That is the scandal. That has to do with corruption. Just look at what that is destroying. That is how small-minded the Minister is, and the rest of his party. To destroy the heritage and concrete it over is their solution to everything. The Minister is scandalous and should give up as quickly as possible. He is no Minister for the environment. The only environment he wants is concrete.

If the Minister continues to interrupt I will continue in the same vein. Just in case the Minister does not understand Irish in any shape or form, I referred to the scandal in Trim, where a multistorey hotel is being built next to a national monument. It is taking away from the national monument. The Minister is supposed to promote national monuments, not allow building on top of or next to them.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	533	The Deputy should repeat that outside the House if he is man enough.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	535	That was great. I should have spent more time in Irish class. I could have enjoyed that much more.The Minister may not realise it but this Bill depends on trust. It is not just the trust of the Minister, but of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the procedures etc. One person told me the Bill was equivalent to giving the Minister a JCB and telling him to point it where he likes. That is what is felt about it. It is the duty of the Minister to allay people's fears in this regard once and for all. Either this is proper legislation or it is not. To rush it though without proper consultation and without involving everybody will not help to allay those fears.This is similar to what I have said on numerous occasions in this House. Bills which could be rushed through are not, and straggle on for ages. Important Bills, over which there may be doubts, are forced through. The last example was another Bill rushed through in a mad charge by the Minister on electronic voting. I told the Minister to take his time so that people's fears could be allayed. We did not do that and it came back to haunt us.What is wrong with getting it right and bringing everybody with us, rather than alienating people? People have fears in this regard. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be in charge of this Bill, whether the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is still here in three years' time or his successor is in place. If the Bill is passed, the Department will have the power to decide whether a monument should be flattened.I wish to discuss the Department's record. It once proposed the construction of a nuclear power plant by the coast, on the Irish Sea, but fortunately it did not happen. Nobody passed such a law. That is the Department's record. We are here to discuss the Bill because the routes selected by the Department, or an authority for which it is responsible, led to problems. The Bill is needed because of bad planning, whether on the part of the Minister, his Department or local authorities. A site beside the castle in Trim intended to be developed as a car park will now be the location of a hotel. There is right and there is wrong but it all relates to the record of the Department. I do not refer to the Minister but the Department which will be responsible for the Bill.People have fears because the Bill gives serious powers to anyone who wants to use them, for example to knock or move a monument. I accept that such powers may sometimes be needed. There may be doubts about whether something is a monument. The Bill does not clarify what a national monument is.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	536	It is in the main Bill.

We had problems in Carrickmines because nobody knew how to decide whether something was a national monument. There are problems with laws when there are doubts.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	540	There is no doubt.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	541	There is. There was a problem in Carrickmines because the council said it was not a national monument, whereas others said it was. There was a doubt because nobody could adjudicate on the matter.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	542	Can the Deputy define it?

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I accept that. We will do it in the main Bill.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	555	The Minister accepts it but when will he do something about it?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	556	It is very difficult to define.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I agree that it is difficult but that is not the point.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	558	That is all I am saying.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	559	The Minister is bringing forward this Bill without defining a national monument. The phrase "putting the cart before the horse" comes to mind.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	560	No.

When he introduced the Bill to provide for electronic voting, he rubbished the claims of so-called computer experts who had concerns about it. He said they were not accredited to anybody and did not have any expertise. Something similar is happening in this case. The Minister is introducing a Bill which will provide the power to remove, knock or disturb a national monument but he cannot define what a national monument is.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	562	That has always been the case. It is in the 1930 legislation.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	567	It is because it was not accepted as law by the courts. The Minister has to re-establish it.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	568	It was all——
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	569	What is in the legislation then?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	570	The 1930 Act states it is not lawful "to demolish or remove wholly or in part or to disfigure, deface, alter, or in any manner injure or interfere with any such national monument".

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	572	This Bill states——
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	573	It states the same thing. It is reaffirming it.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	574	I am not changing the law.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	575	Why is this Bill being brought forward then? It is not needed if the Minister is not changing the law.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	576	I am proposing this Bill because section 14 of the 1930 Act was struck down by the High Court.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	577	There was a doubt.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	578	We now have a hiatus.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	579	We are back to the same question. The Bill gives the Minister powers which he does not have because there are doubts in respect of the courts. He cannot pursue the Carrickmines case. The Bill which will give the Minister, or his Department, more powers does not define what a national monument is. The definition is fundamental to the entire matter.It is a question of trust, as I have said. I mentioned that this Bill was being proposed to deal with bad planning. Why did the M50 end up at Carrickmines Castle? Surely many other routes could have been pursued.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	580	There is no castle.

One could argue all day about whether something is a monument but the Minister cannot argue with me because he does not have a definition of a national monument. We ran into a roadblock in the case of the M50. The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, can chat away — I will talk to myself if they want.In the case of the M3 we ended up in the Tara and Skryne valley. One could have chosen many alternative routes. Six were proposed — one could have considered 20 others — but we have ended up in a questionable place. Why did we end up there? Could we not have gone somewhere else where there would have been no hassle and this legislation would not have been needed? Despite our many planners, whizz-kids and technology experts, we have ended up in a place with 30 or 40 potential archaeological sites.

Digs have started but arguments about the route are continuing and may continue for another five years.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	610	There will be arguments, regardless of the route one chooses.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The Minister is wrong. Routes have been chosen in other cases and it has been done. There was no problem when the so-called bypass was originally constructed in Navan — there was no argument about it and it was done. It turned out that the bypass went through the town. The Minister is leaving the Chamber but I will finish my contribution.One has to ask why we ended up here. A bad tradesman will always have his tools to get him out of trouble but this Bill is getting us out of bad planning and bad decision-making. A carpenter might measure twice and cut once but that does not seem to apply to the Government which can correct its mistakes with new laws. Fundamental mistakes have been made and there is a doubt about procedures in respect of the M50, the M3 and other roads. I do not understand why we do not take steps to avoid such problems, thereby ensuring we do not need Bills of this kind.It is a matter of trust, as I have said. People do not trust the record of the Department under the leadership of the Minister, or his predecessor. It is proposed to give the Department which sanctioned the spending of €50 million on machines that have the potential to be proven to be flawed or unusable the power to remove national monuments at its discretion. I find it strange that we are asking the people to accept such a law. If we are to shove through this Bill, it should include a provision that will allow the Minister to reconsider a national monument, for example, by establishing a panel of experts to assess it. Any group which fights the Government or the NRA on this issue or any issue relating to roads, trains, etc., will employ experts. The best way to get agreement is to bring experts from both sides together. If they have been trained in the same place and have the same background, they will be able to decide what is right or wrong and advise the Minister accordingly.I question many of the things done by the NRA as it was choosing the route of the new motorway through County Meath. It would not give answers or listen to people. It was shy in coming back with information. It adopted a kind of bully-boy attitude. Any mistakes made by it can be covered up because the Minister can get it out of trouble by removing a monument, or getting An Bord Pleanála to make site changes on the roads without going back again. It is wrong. It does not make sense.The Bill gives the Minister the right to remove monuments but it is mainly concerned with driving through the M50 project. It is not democratic that the need to proceed with the M50 will override anybody else's view. There is no doubt that we want things to be built quicker. We all want the M50, the M3 and every other road built quicker but we have to put a price on our heritage. We cannot just bulldoze through our heritage sites any time we want. We cannot remove them willy-nilly. It took thousands of years for our heritage to develop and we cannot simply destroy it with the stroke of a pen because it is in the way. That is not the way to proceed. I could say more but I have made my point, although it is a pity the Minister had to leave the Chamber.I question the need for this Bill. If we did our job right, we would not need it. It is wrong to give anybody the power to move or bury a monument. The way we are going about this whole process is wrong. We need to involve others and listen to them. There are those who object to roads for the sake of objecting. We can all see through this but people have a right to object to the building of a road if it affects them personally or because they have a strong belief in protecting our heritage and culture. We do not have the right to override this. That is not what the law is about. Governments should govern, be fair and make the right decisions.The Bill will give more powers to An Bord Pleanála in that if something has to be changed slightly, the whole process will not have to be gone through again. I do not have a major problem with this. An Bord Pleanála is independent and it will not be a case of one person making the decision. In quite a number of cases, however, An Bord Pleanála did not accept its own inspectors' recommendations. This happened most recently in Dunboyne, prior to which there was another case in County Meath. Its own inspectors made a recommendation — I understand it had to do with an incinerator — not to grant permission but the board overruled them. I wonder why the board would send its own investigators and then overrule their recommendations. That is strange but it all comes down to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which is all over the people concerned. It also has a say in what the National Roads Authority does because it provides funding for it. It is wrong to say the NRA is in charge. Those in charge are the Ministers for Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. They make the decisions and it is to them the NRA should answer.I said previously in regard to the M3, about which I know more than the M50, on which Deputy Olivia Mitchell can speak, that there is a doubt about the reason that route was chosen. The Government has a duty to put that doubt to bed if there is to be agreement on all sides. If we go back over the procedures, if everything is done properly and fairly, and if we listen to the experts on all sides, there will be agreement on a route. It may be proved that there is an alternative and that alternative could be a railway line.To return to the M3, when we talk to the experts employed by the Government, through the NRA, the councils or whatever, they say a railway line cannot be built beside a motorway. They said it could not be done in this case. Most people in any county would accept that some farmland might have to be destroyed to build a railway line but the building of a motorway will always be questioned. Other countries have not always succeeded in reducing traffic delays but trains do this. In the case in County Meath, however, people were told they could not have a railway line, that they were getting a motorway. The suggestion then was to acquire enough land through CPOs to run a railway line beside the motorway but, again, that is not possible. There is a lack of common sense in picking routes, what we do afterwards and even in our daily business in not running a railway line beside a motorway. This is done in every other country. Why can it not be done here?Speaking of other countries, no example has been given of what happens in other countries when national monuments are in the way of development. If this Bill is so right, why can someone not give an example of what happens in France or Spain? I am sure other countries come up against these problems. What do they do? Do they go around them, remove them or bury them? What is the procedure? What laws do they have to deal with this issue? We have not been given examples to back up the Bill. There are too many unanswered questions and too many doubts raised. We had doubts about the previous Bill the Minister brought before the House and we all know where it ended up — it cost a lot of money.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I wish to share my time with Deputy Burton.I share the views expressed on this side of the House about this legislation. There is no doubt that the Bill goes far beyond what is necessary in terms of the Supreme Court decision to deal with the technical glitch that made the orders invalid and that it moves into a whole new realm of transferring power to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. That is the nub of the issue. We should remember it is not just the Minister for the Environment about whom we are talking but the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The Minister has a particular responsibility to protect our heritage but it appears that the direct thrust of section 5 — the core of the Bill — is to allow the Minister to demolish, destroy or export archaeological heritage, our built heritage, if he or she deems fit. The only caveat is that he or she has to wait 14 days for a reply from the director of the National Museum of Ireland. How can the character of a particular archaeological find be assessed in 14 days? It simply cannot be done. In the Carrickmines controversy initially nobody had any idea of the extent of the find. It was only after a considerable period that it came to light. To expect something of that nature to be identified and dealt with adequately in that space of time is unreal. It is so unreal it makes that particular caveat meaningless because the Minister will have absolute discretion to do what he or she likes. That is the thrust of this legislation. That is the reason everybody is concerned about it.Now more than ever modern technology — geophysics, aerial photography, etc. — has revealed a far greater quantity of archaeological sites than was previously expected or known. They have multiplied by a huge factor in recent years and many of them have not been properly mapped out. The Minister indicated that he was working his way through the various counties in the mapping process but that we were a long way from having it completed with the modern technology currently available. Some independent assessment must be made. A flexible timescale is needed to ensure we do not destroy valuable treasures. This is not presented in the Bill which leaves open to legalised vandalism our various sites in that if a road or a particular building is required on economic grounds, it will always take precedence over the heritage that may be in its path.We need to reflect and seek expert opinion on the broader powers being granted to the Minister in the Bill. Our heritage, whether archaeological or architectural, including contents, fittings and furniture of buildings in place for centuries, needs a broader canvas than the one with which we have been dealing. It is difficult to see a situation where adequate protection is given to it.Recently the contents of Lissadell House were sold without reference to its future. The impact of the distribution of the contents far and wide to the highest bidder on the heritage of the house and its lands was not taken into consideration. Likewise, the house was disposed of, despite the cry for State involvement to ensure protection of its heritage. There is still no guarantee that it will be protected. Today the contents of University Hall on Hatch Street, run as student accommodation by the Jesuit order since the foundation of University College Dublin, are being sold to the highest bidder. In the autumn the hall will be sold.A number of churches, church halls, schools and properties have been disposed of in an ad hoc fashion. In the Dublin Central constituency Arran Quay Church is boarded up and falling into rack and ruin. Temple Street Church is used for late night raves unsuited to its fabric and already the spire is in a dangerous condition. The Black Church is one of the few churches which have been put to a business use while the Sandymount Church was demolished. The school, church and lands at Belcamp and Claude Hall in Drumcondra have been sold. Everywhere our built heritage, including fittings and contents, is being sold off without any protective mechanisms being put in place. No warning is given for these sales and often the owners sell to the highest bidder.Legislation that gives absolute discretion to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to dispose of, demolish or destroy our heritage if it is inconvenient to a particular development is not needed. An overall structure with broad parameters to protect our heritage should be put in place. For example, University Hall, with a capacity for 100 people, could be developed as a wonderful asset for international students, particularly in this the centenary year of Bloomsday. It could be developed in the context of our international literary renown rather than being sold off as an apartment block. The contents have already been disposed of. A moratorium is needed to ensure this part of our heritage is not put on the market. Instead such buildings should be referred to the Office of Public Works, local authorities and a heritage conservation body to give breathing space to permit appropriate use. Without such a structure, much of our built heritage is coming on the market and being inappropriately used or destroyed.This Bill was originally intended to deal with the Carrickmines case and the technical issue that arose from the Supreme Court decision. However, it will now open the floodgates to the destruction of far more of our archaeological and built heritage than would be possible under the original Act. The National Monuments Act is not adequate to meet our needs or cope with the number of previously unknown heritage sites. However, this Bill is damaging in its potential, unnecessary in what it sets out to do and does not deal with the positive requirements to protect our national heritage.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I thank Deputy Costello for agreeing to share his time with me.This long-awaited Bill intends to bring a resolution to the Carrickmines case and its long planning history associated with the old Dublin County Council. The debacle of the Carrickmines case, with a large amount of money misspent, would never have occurred if there had been more work and transparency on the project ten years ago. Many wish to see a resolution. I accept that many confronted with traffic gridlock feel desperate situations require desperate remedies. Every Member realises that this Bill seeks to address an extremely difficult case. However, it also sets out wider powers and authority for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding our archaeological and built heritage. Given that Fianna Fáil is above all else the builders' party, the manner in which this Bill is being rushed through the House, without adequate measured public debate from those for or against, gives rise to the deepest suspicion as to its real motivations.The Dublin West constituency, like much of north County Dublin, is an area of outstanding natural beauty. Its small number of greenbelt areas and protected buildings are the envy of builders and developers who wish to build on them. It is lucky that the Phoenix Park is protected, because if not, it would be the site of Fianna Fáil developers' nine to 11 storey buildings. Every Member is glad that Dublin city's population is growing. Part of the solution in providing accommodation lies in a high density approach which must be related to the availability of public transport.Why has the Dublin West constituency lost much of its built heritage through accidental fires and the like? There are sites where up to 2,000 homes are built alongside a listed 19th century house, around which hoardings go up, indicating it is either to be a nursing home or a restaurant. Then, over a bank holiday weekend, it is either accidentally demolished, destroyed by vandals or accidentally catches fire.In north County Dublin, a huge amount of our built heritage has disappeared. What about trees, some of them 200 years old? In the area action plan, preservation of trees is a priority but when surveys are then done by tree surgeons, half of the trees are listed as being diseased. If the same principle were applied to humans, half the human race could be demolished on the basis of lacking perfection and perhaps having some incipient conditions.We are bleeding our environment and losing our historic properties and houses. In former days they belonged in many cases to the Anglo-Irish community, to big farmers, but they were built by ordinary Irish craftsmen. They were built by our grandfathers and looked after by our grandmothers. We have no respect for preserving that fantastic built heritage which younger people today are finally coming to appreciate. It was understandable that in the aftermath of independence such buildings would be seen as somehow symbolic of something that might be done away with, but that is no longer the case.We now have the amazing concept of two motorways within 20 miles of each other in the Meath area. In the original plans they were far apart, but they are now planned to come close to each other. We have a disused railway line running from Dunboyne to Navan, yet the Government prioritises a motorway which may cause incredible destruction to possibly the richest archaeological area in Ireland.I represent Dublin West and many people from there now live in the Meath area. Everyone knows the incredible levels of traffic in the eastern part of Meath and west Dublin. It crosses part of Deputy Costello's constituency because there are only a few points through which that traffic can get to the Dublin city centre. What has happened? We are proposing more motorways to end up accessing three narrow funnels into the north side of Dublin city which, with the advent of Luas, may well provide substantially reduced access. We are not putting the money into public transport, into the re-opening of railways, the electrification of the railway line or bus routes, which would offer a short-term resolution. We have an open season for builders and developers who are allowed do what they want without any countervailing balance of development of public transport or in terms of the preservation of the historic environment, including outstanding trees. This is totally wrong.Another example relates to my own constituency. Farmleigh was initially purchased by the State as the Taoiseach's weekend residence and then became a State guest-house. When it was purchased, the OPW had to give an undertaking that the land across the road, owned by the trust representing the Guinness family interests, would not be the subject of any intervention by any State body with regard to planning applications on that land. As a consequence, Dúchas, the heritage services and various other bodies who would properly have an interest in developments on the edge of the Phoenix Park had no power to put forward sensible interventions regarding trees and historic properties on the site. However much money Ireland makes from pharmaceuticals or from IT, for example, tourism will remain a critically important product in terms of its employment and earnings.In the Dublin and east coast regions we are allowing an important heritage to be destroyed piecemeal, which in the end will cost this country economically. This Bill has raised many fears among those interested that once again, it is open season for Fianna Fáil, the builder's friend.

Like many other Deputies, I am disappointed that the Bill is to be guillotined tonight and that there will be a vote on it. There should have been much more debate. I know that four hours were given to it, but it is an important Bill. When one deals with monuments and planning issues there is bound to be contention, with many views expressed, particularly the view that we should protect our heritage and culture.A common sense approach is needed in this matter. The Bill gives the Minister permission to issue directions in respect of national monuments notwithstanding the fact that such consent or directions may involve injury or interference to the whole or part of a monument. The Bill also makes provision for appropriate protection of our archaeological heritage along the routes of approved road developments, including the south eastern route of the M50 which most Deputies have been speaking about since the Bill was introduced.This is the seventh piece of emergency legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas this year. It is obviously rushed legislation to deal with the Carrickmines issue. We have much rushed legislation before us in the next few weeks. There is also the Airport Authority Bill published this afternoon. That important Bill, which provides for the break-up of the three main airports, will be rushed and will be guillotined on July 8. It is a different issue for another day.Road building projects throughout the country are very important. We live in a changing society where many of us regularly make representations either to the NRA or to the Minister for Transport to rush through road building projects. In my own constituency the Ennis by-pass was supposed to start in 2002, but started in April of this year, two years overdue. It involved many problems, particularly regarding archaeological finds and surveys. Before the motorway started, €9 million was put aside for the archaeological work. Some 50 recorded monuments were found on parts of the route. Most were marked and photographed, but they did not hold up the project, which went ahead. Some of the items found dated back to the Bronze Age. Timber vessels and washing utensils were found. It is important, however, to remember that the Carrickmines archaeological project cost nearly €50 million of taxpayers' money. The road building was delayed because of the finds along the route. In Deputy Cullen's constituency, where the Waterford by-pass is being built, there has been a major Viking find which may turn out to be the most important in Europe. Its full extent is not yet clear.I visited the Vasa Museum in Stockholm a few years ago. An old ship was found in the port area of the city. It was covered in silt but was perfectly preserved.

While I realise the matter is an environmental responsibility, I regret the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not present. Perhaps he will contribute later in the debate.The importance of a good quality environment to our individual well being, and to the national economy cannot be over-emphasised. This is especially so in the case of the agricultural sector which promotes high quality produce from a green, pollution free environment. Water is a major national asset that, some time ago, may have been taken for granted by some sections of our population. However, the sectors that realised its economic importance were always aware that, as a basic raw material for agriculture and industry and an important amenity, it was essential that it be protected. I am not aware of anyone unconcerned with the protection of water quality.The agricultural community knows more than most that modern farming practices must be managed with due care. If not, they will be the main victims from the fallout. This realisation led to the farm organisations signing up to the code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates in 1996. Farmers are committed to a high quality rural environment.Directive 91/676/EEC concerning nitrates is a 1991 directive concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. The directive generally requires member states to monitor waters and identify waters which are polluted or are liable to pollution, promote good agricultural practice to protect water quality, develop and implement action programmes to reduce and prevent pollution of waters from agricultural sources, monitor the effectiveness of action programmes and report to the EU Commission on progress in reducing pollution.Excluding the period 1995 to 1997, when the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Mr. Ivan Yates, and the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, got agreement on good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates, what have successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments done since 1991? Nothing. The failure to implement the directive in the 13 years since its inception means that we may face its implementation at the strictest possible levels and against a background of European Court rulings against various member states, including Ireland.What the Government had to do was not too difficult — an implementation timeframe for the directive was laid down in black and white at the time. The Government should have identified waters with nitrate problems or those at risk from nitrate pollution by 1992, whether through a whole territory approach or nitrogen vulnerable zone approach. In addition, Ireland's first four year action programme to address this problem should have been in place by 1995.The organic nitrogen level to be adhered to in this initial action programme would have been 210kg per hectare. All but 2,000 to 3,000 of Ireland's most intensively stocked farmers would be below this 210kg level. Ireland should now be completing its second action programme and a level of 170kg per hectare is set for this. However, Ireland would have had the opportunity throughout the period 1995 to 1999 to put forward a strong case for derogations for intensively stocked farmers — derogations which would have been in place by 2000 and the commencement of Ireland's second action programme. However, procrastination and a failure to act has left us staring at a 170kg per hectare stocking rate across the country, whether farmers are in an area which has a problem with nitrate in groundwater.The directive is enforceable under cross-compliance from the mid-term review from January 2005 and failure to comply with it may result in penalties on the single farm payment. This threat, aligned to changes that farmers will have to make if the Government does not act on the 170kg limit, has led to serious concerns in the agricultural sector as it faces the options of up-sizing in land or decreasing stock levels. The approach proposed by the Government in its draft action programme, which I believe is still policy — the Minister might confirm this — will have a disastrous impact on the efficiency, income and competitiveness of Irish farmers. Farmers have invested heavily in improved farmyards and manure storage facilities. It is estimated that approximately €1.5 billion has been spent in this area over the past 15 years, a clear indication of the commitment of farmers to protecting and improving water quality.The EPA's latest monitoring of water quality suggests that 70% of our rivers are unpolluted and 85% of our lakes are in a satisfactory condition. This is an improvement in water quality on previous reports and water quality has improved dramatically, particularly since the advent of the rural environment protection scheme. There has been a decline in the amount of river channel classified as seriously polluted from 1% to 0.5%. This improvement needs to continue and is continuing as farmers adhere to the code of good agricultural practice.Other groups and organisations, including statutory ones, need to get their houses in order and it would be welcome if they were pursued with the same vigour as the farming sector. At a rough estimate, the action programme as it currently stands could result in an income loss of €60 million per annum. Some 9% of farms will have to reduce stock numbers or up-size and, as the Minister is aware, most farmers cannot compete for the purchase of land given the current climate. In some more intensive farming regions, up to 18% of farmers may have to reduce stock numbers. In County Cork, the home county of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the majority of which does not have a nitrates problem, 18% of farmers will have to reduce stock numbers at a cost of €13 million per annum to the county. The capital cost for extra farm storage will be approximately €1.5 billion, which will impact on 10,000 to 12,000 farmers, many of whom have no nitrates problem. Over 40% of dairy farmers would have to either cut production or expand their land area.Criticism of the Government draft action plan has come from many quarters in addition to the Opposition. Dr. George Smilie of the Department of Crop Science at UCD has dismissed the directive, stating: "There is a total of lack of scientific facts in the plan." He also criticised Teagasc for its lack of research in the area. He noted that the two crucial determinants for the acceptance of slurry on land are climate and soil and that the storage requirements in the action programme do not take into consideration the different land soil conditions within various counties.The farm organisations point out that Teagasc cannot provide scientific evidence for the 170kg limit. Teagasc, in defence of its position, stated:In January 2002, the agency recommended a whole country approach as the best option for Ireland based on the assumption that the option of 210kg organic nitrogen per hectare provided for in the directive for the first four years of an action programme would be available to Ireland.Teagasc also stated that the ultimate decision has been taken by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. In addition, farm organisations insist that during partnership talks they were led to believe that 210kg per hectare on a countrywide basis would be implemented, with subsequent derogations up to 250kg per hectare.The directive is most definitely not a case of "one size fits all". It might be appropriate in some parts of Europe where soil temperatures and growth over the five months of winter are close to zero. However, in Ireland, particularly along the south coast, soil temperatures are higher. Growth rates there cannot be equalled elsewhere in Europe. It is important to note that the directive discriminates heavily against the grassland farming practised in Ireland. Intensive dairy farmers in Ireland currently take advantage of our very high grass production as a consequence of an unusually long growing season. As conditions for grass growth are exceptionally good over a very large part of the year, high stocking rates can be sustained, unlike parts of the Continent. A scientific survey carried out in the Ballyroe Co-operative area, a copy of which I am sure the Minister's colleague has at his disposal, indicates that with a growing season of 330 days, 320 grazing days and more than adequate rainfall and livestock indoors for just six weeks of the year, a level of 250 kg. of nitrogen per hectare can be justified without any negative impact on water quality.The Irish Grassland Association put forward arguments against the current proposals. It states that water quality in Ireland ranks as one of the highest in Europe, and I acknowledge the role the Minister has played in achieving this. The grassland crop has a longer growing season based on permanent grassland. Irish climatic and soil conditions allow a longer grazing season in many areas of the country. The majority of Irish dairy herds calve in spring with the aim of optimising grass utilisation. Grazed land is normally harvested in a three to four week cycle, which ensures that the grass remains in a vegetative state and capable of high nitrogen uptake rates over a very long period. Intensive Irish grass-based farming systems do not pose a threat if point source pollution is contained and good agricultural practice is adhered to, which is happening.In a parliamentary reply on 1 June 2004, the Minister for Agriculture and Food stated:Under Sustaining Progress, the Government is committed to using the flexibility of the Nitrates Directive to seek European Commission approval for a derogation allowing organic nitrogen limits of up to 250 kg. per hectare, per annum. After the draft action programme is finalised and submitted to the European Commission, a derogation proposal designed to take account of the unique characteristics of Irish agriculture will also be submitted. [I assume these characteristics are the ones I have already outlined]. In the context of finalising the derogation proposal, the objective is to achieve approval for appropriate derogation arrangements in a manner that underpins the future of our commercial agriculture sector.The proposed closed periods make no sense, which has been recognised by all sides. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Aylward, pointed out that the Department will examine alternative options to the calendar-based approach to slurry storage in the proposed nitrates directive action plan. He went on to say that one has only to look at the weather of the last 12 months to realise that slurry spreading and storage limits based rigidly on calendar months may not be the best policy from an environmental point of view. We could have been spreading slurry very safely at Christmas last year, for example. He expressed concern if bad weather coincided with the end of a banned period.A common sense approach is required. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not appear to understand the needs of farmers. An unpublished draft action plan for the directive implementation suggested that there would be a ban on spreading slurry on week days and bank holidays, clearly indicating how out of touch is the Department. The Department of Agriculture and Food has a role to play here but, ultimately, the buck stops with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.I am concerned that the Minister may seek to temporarily pacify people by outlining how he intends to seek derogations. While he sought to create an impression that these will be obtained, the EU Environment Commissioner, speaking in Dublin last month, suggested that this was far from guaranteed. The only derogation granted by the Commission is in regard to Denmark. It provides a very restrictive derogation for the 170 kg. per hectare organic nitrogen up to 230 kg. It is only available based on an individual farm application and applies to just 5% of the land and 10% of livestock units. There is now concern that the derogation process may be too penal to go through for some farmers. There is also speculation that the Minister may seek to have an implementation date of July 2007. The endless speculation and uncertainty is causing difficulty and I hope the Minister tonight, or Government speakers tomorrow night, will be able to clarify the situation.We need to see if there is any scientific evidence to back up the Minister's proposals of a 170 kg. limit. He should not hide behind the court ruling. There is something inherently unfair and unjust if the ability of farmers to earn a living is restricted by a directive that cannot be scientifically justified, which is the nub of the issue. There is something unfair and unjust about a society which places an unfair burden on farmers with a directive for which there is no scientific evidence. This is not the only country which has a difficulty with the directive. It can be changed if the political will exists. If the Minister or any other speaker can demonstrate to Fine Gael that in order to protect and improve the quality of our water we must have a level of 170 kg., then so be it, but I do not believe they can.We need to go back to the drawing board with this directive. Our water quality has improved dramatically since the directive was agreed in 1991. Let someone show me how, by adhering to a 170 kg. limit, we can improve our water quality. No one in the country will suffer more than the agricultural community from poor water quality. It has voluntarily invested €1.5 billion in it over the past 14 or 15 years and the investment continues. I recognise the role the Government is playing by providing money under the national development plan to assist in storage facilities. However, we must not place another burden on farmers. Where is the great catch cry, "freedom to farm", which was sold to everyone in recent years? While we got rid of red tape, we now talk about having to comply with every other directive. It goes without saying that we all want to protect water quality but how will it be damaged by having a level higher than 170 kg.?
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	623	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very serious issue. My colleague, Deputy Timmins, outlined many of the technical issues in the proposal. I do not entirely blame the Minister because the man who should be sitting beside him is the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. He is in charge of agriculture and he should have led the way to ensure this issue was dealt with in a proper and structured manner, and not under pressure from the court.This directive was agreed in 1991. There was some progress on it during the short time the former Minister, Ivan Yates, was in office. As nothing has happened since, our backs are now against the wall. Earlier today, someone telephoned me from Cork to explain how serious the situation is there. If the Minster's proposal is accepted it will mean a lower stocking rate, lower output and the demise of commercial farming as we know it.In areas along the Border, in Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan, where people have suffered 30 years of troubles, they are now being asked to provide 24 weeks storage accommodation. There is a parish called Killanny, half of which is in County Louth and half is in County Monaghan. How can one explain a proposal whereby a farmer in one half of the parish must provide 16 weeks storage while a farmer in the other half of the parish must provide 24 weeks storage? Is there any scientific basis for such a proposal? Is it common sense to have a directive that is so arbitrary it will ensure living on one side of the river is very different from living on the other side?What will the directive mean across the Border? Will farmers across the Border have to meet the same criteria as people in Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and Leitrim? I suggest not. We stood idly by over a number of years and allowed the poultry industry to explode in Northern Ireland. They did not have to have planning permission or meet any regulations, yet people in County Monaghan could not get planning permission for one new poultry house, even though it was the home of the poultry industry in Ireland. Will people involved in the poultry, pig and mushroom industry in Cavan and Monaghan in particular have to deal with the grassland issue? In recent years people have been able to dispose of that product in other counties such as Louth, Meath and Northern Ireland, which will no longer be possible.No plan has been put in place in this regard. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government let this proposal go down to the wire, and we are now told that if we do not implement the proposals the directive payments from Brussels will be withheld. There were many opportunities to get a better deal but nothing was done. We are now being told we can get a derogation. However, if it is similar to what the Danes got, it will not be much use. A dairy farmer with 40 cows will either have to lease extra land or cut down on his stock. Any expert will confirm that a dairy farmer can no longer make a living from 40 cows, not to mind if the number is reduced. Most will confirm that the farmer needs to have 80 cows or more. If a farmer and son is involved in the farm, the number would have to be more than 100.Will the Minister sit there and allow the demise of commercial farming as we know it? That is what is happening. I have some experience of dealing with farmers' problems and I have a dairy farm. I know what it costs to provide the necessary storage capacity for the slurry. Most interesting, however, is the concept that we should spread the slurry according to the calendar. Look at what happened in the past two years. The year before last we cut the first cut of silage on 15 June. Some cut it right up into July. That did not happen in Cork except, perhaps, in west Cork. The weather conditions were not suitable. However, October and November of last year were extremely suitable for spreading slurry and the reaction of the grass was magnificent. Anybody could see it. If we implement this regulation, that will be illegal. The regulation forces the spreading of slurry into a short period of the year. If the grass has grown too quickly or the weather conditions do not permit it, what will we do? Will we have to provide slurry accommodation for 28 to 30 weeks?I ask the Minister to apply a degree of common sense to this issue. We need to ensure that commercial agriculture as we know it remains one of the mainstays of this economy. How many agricultural colleges have been closed by now? Five have been closed in my area, possibly more. That does not say much for the encouragement of young farmers.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, will go down in history as the Ministers who ended commercial farming in this country if they allow this directive to be implemented as it stands. I urge the Minister to take seriously the request of farm organisations that he study the facts before him. I could spend the day discussing them. If he allows this proposal to be finalised in Brussels, commercial farming is doomed.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	624	This directive is a negative milestone in the history of agriculture in Ireland. If it is implemented as planned, many farmers will not be able to survive. I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues to look at it again. It is an extremely serious matter.It is not just Opposition Members who oppose this. Dairygold is currently the country's largest farmer owned milk processor. It processes over 200 million gallons of milk or 20% of the country's milk pool. Recently, Mr. Henchy, the chief executive of Dairygold, said that farming at present is under a great deal of pressure. As Deputy Crawford mentioned, many young people might decide not to enter farming as a result. Mr. Henchy pointed out that successful expansion at farm level can only be achieved if farmers are allowed to utilise fully the potential of their holdings in a manner that is environmentally correct. He said that the nitrates directive limit of 170 kg per hectare will prevent the development of this form of responsible, intensive dairy farming. He went on to say that the stocking rates imposed by the proposed nitrates directive will force most Dairygold suppliers to cut stocking rates by between 15% and 20%, with a consequent increase in milk production costs and a cap on future expansion potential. He believes this will be disastrous for the future of dairying in the region.The directive ignores the fact that nitrate levels have been improving in recent years and will continue to do so. A scientific assessment of soil and weather as opposed to arbitrary calendar dates should be the guide for suitable spreading conditions. This reminds me of something that is said to have occurred in the Soviet Union. It appears that at one stage its centrally controlled economy sent out directives which stated that the wheat should be set today and should also be harvested today. This directive smacks of something similar. It ignores local conditions. It ignores the fact that the south of Ireland, where I live, has a different climate, different types of rainfall and different weather patterns from those in other parts of Ireland and other parts of Europe. It has been argued that in parts of west Cork the grass never stops growing.This directive will also attempt to put in place expensive infrastructure. That will be another burden on farmers and I am not sure that the Ministers have taken account of this. It will also undermine the competitiveness of the agriculture industry. Many thousands of people depend on agri-industry for their livelihoods. Agriculture is still one of the biggest industries, if not the biggest, in Ireland. This directive has the potential to undermine and destroy the industry.The Minister promised to cut down on the amount of paperwork and record keeping in the industry. This directive will have the opposite effect. Farmers will be obliged to maintain all kinds of extra records and that will also increase costs. The Minister should bear that in mind. Furthermore, the Department of Agriculture and Food should be the competent authority. I urge the Minister to examine this and find out if it would be possible. Qualified farmers should be able to fill out their nutrient management plans. They are capable of doing it so why should they have to pay other people to do it?Other issues have been brought to my attention. A claim has been made by the deputy president of the IFA that Teagasc has been silenced. I have been told that this has been done under the Official Secrets Act. I do not know if this is true but the Minister should confirm or deny it and state whether Teagasc can comment scientifically on this directive. There is also the issue of the presence of clover in grassland. Are we not eligible for a derogation because of that? Has that been taken into account?This directive will have a negative impact in the Minister's constituency. I am told that Carbury Milk Products, for example, recently signed an agreement to spread sludge on 17,000 acres. If this directive is implemented, the consequences for that factory will be enormous. It will not be able to do the work because farmers will have to withdraw the land. Scientific evidence shows that the 170 kg. limit is too low. It is possible to safely raise the limit much higher. I have seen the scientific evidence but I do not know if the Minister has taken the trouble to look at it.

What will it mean to farmers when it is implemented? Will it mean more paperwork and more expense for farmers? Will it be workable? We need to do more. The Minister must go back to the drawing board where this directive is concerned.Northern Ireland was far faster off the mark. 
     As Deputy Crawford said, they have achieved something that has not been achieved here. We would like to know why.The code of good farming practice was put into effect in 1996 with a view to putting in place an acceptable implementation plan for the nitrates directive. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has stood idly by since, when he should have been working on this. He allowed the implementation date for the directive to drag on.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I commend Deputy Timmins on the introduction of this important motion. We are discussing a serious problem which affects the future of Irish farming. The Government's draft action plan for the nitrates directive produces measures that are unnecessary, unworkable and unaffordable for Irish farmers. A legally enforceable standard organic nitrogen limit of 170 kg per hectare translates to at least 1.25 hectares per cow. It has been accepted since I was young and at home on the farm that a viable farming unit was one cow per acre. These provisions mean that an 80-acre farmer will have 50 cows and its followers. This level of production is not economically viable.The minimum storage requirements of 16 weeks in the south and east, 20 weeks in the midlands and west and 24 weeks in the far north-west cannot be funded by farm incomes which have declined over recent decades. Farmers will not be in a position to meet these requirements. The investment involved will make farming not viable for many farmers and force them out of the industry. There are severe restrictions on animal manure application on grasslands for three and a half months in winter without reference to the good-quality water that currently exists or to weather or ground conditions. The Government's proposals will severely undermine commercial farming in Ireland. Production on many farms will be reduced to a level which is not viable and additional costs, independently estimated to be more than €1 billion per annum, will be imposed on farmers.The EU directive is concerned with preventing and reducing pollution by controlling nitrates in agriculture. However, concerns which emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s about the health effects of nitrates in drinking water are being reconsidered. Furthermore, studies by the EPA show that groundwater quality in Ireland is very high and has improved over the past decade. Ireland's water quality compares favourably with that in other member states.Ireland is not alone among its EU counterparts in encountering difficulties in implementing this directive. The European Commission is in dispute with 13 member states about the directive. I ask the Minister to review the implementation of the directive. The Commission must allow Ireland to adopt an action programme which allows standard organic nitrogen limits of up to 250 kg per hectare without unnecessary costly regulations. Water quality in Ireland is improving and the farming community is committed to perfecting the quality and cleanliness of water across the country. Farmers are guardians of the countryside and its heritage and have long recognised the importance of protecting their natural environment in its own right and as a vital resource for agriculture and the food industry.Successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy have favoured extensive production with lower stocking densities, resulting in a reduction of fertiliser and feed input. Approximately 38,500 farmers, or half of all farmers in the community, are participating in the rural environmental scheme, which requires participants to enter into contractual programmes with the Government and the EU to meet high environmental and heritage protection standards. Since 1994, intensive agricultural enterprises in Ireland have been subject to integrated control licensing, meeting standards on a par with the highest environmental standards of the industry in Europe. All these environmental protection measures have been undertaken at a significant cost to individual farmers. Gross investment in farm buildings in the last decade amounted to more than €2 billion. Environmental protection to improve manure storage and handling facilities feature heavily in our farm building expenditure.The proposed measures are unnecessary in the context of the overall excellent and improving quality of Irish water. Changes that have occurred and are forecast to take place in livestock numbers and levels of fertiliser use, the likely effects of CAP reform phase 3, the introduction of the single farm payment and the significant participation by farmers in the REP scheme ensure that there will be an improvement and renders the proposals as outlined by the Minister totally unnecessary.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I commend Deputy Timmins for introducing this timely motion. The directive, as other speakers have said, was introduced by the European Union in 1991. Most other European countries have implemented it. Unfortunately, however, Ireland has not done so and has been forced by the European Commission to implement the directive. It is sad for Irish agriculture, given the fact that we have held the EU Presidency for the past six months, that very little has been done in this area and that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has not obtained concessions from the EU to protect the livelihood of many farmers.As Deputies Stanton, Timmins and Crawford said in their contributions, commercial farming is at stake. Very few young people now see a future in farming. The directive is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I know submissions have already been made, but the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, must, at this late hour, work to obtain special concessions for Irish agriculture in this area.I represent County Clare, which is in the west of Ireland, and I represented west Clare as a county councillor for five years. West Clare has many small farms. Large farmers will not be seriously affected by this directive but the small farmer with 50 acres and 40 or 50 cows will be affected. Dairy farmers will be particularly badly affected. The directive will impose considerable costs on many young dairy farmers. In a place such as west Clare, where there is bad land and good land, many farmers planted forests in the bad land and maximised the use of the good land, with one cow per acre or more. Dairying was often the only viable income in such areas.Deputy Neville gave the example of a farmer with 50 acres and 40 cows. Under the new directive he will have to reduce his stocking density by ten units or acquire 12 additional acres. I do not know how many farmers could afford to do that. Very few in west Clare could. Then there is the matter of storage facilities. In County Clare, the storage requirement is 20 weeks. Most young Irish farmers are well educated and they use good farming practice. Much farming is dictated by the weather. If we have good weather that is fine but if we do not, particularly if August is bad, people cannot spread slurry because the land is poor and tractors get stuck and do terrible damage to the land. Most farmers agree that there are certain times of the year in which they cannot spread slurry. They will go along with that. However, good farming practice and common sense are all that is needed. I hope the Minister will take note of this because it is an important point.According to Teagasc, if this directive is implemented farm incomes will be reduced by up to 20%. How many young farmers will stay on the land if this directive is brought in? Farming is expensive enough and there is little profit to be made. People live from year to year. There is so much form-filling to do and there will be even more when the directive is implemented. I hope in light of the submissions being made by the various farming bodies and others, the Minister will consider this issue with a common-sense attitude. It is a matter of good farming practice. Our farming community is well educated. I was secretary of a group water scheme for 800 houses for ten years before entering politics. The water quality was good. The recent EPA announcement indicated that water quality is good all over the country.A special case needs to be made for Ireland. Farming in Ireland is totally different. It is not as intensive as it is in other European countries. I hope the Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and Food will make a special case for Ireland as we approach the end of the EU Presidency.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"—endorses the Government's policy of securing the optimal and least cost arrangements for compliance with the nitrates directive, thus protecting the interests both of the Government and of those Irish farmers whose activities would be affected;—notes the range of measures which have been taken by the Government to address the costs at farm level which arise from the directive;—recognises the extensive consultations with farming interests which have taken place, and will continue, in relation to the implementation of the national nitrates action programme;—notes the connection between the early finalisation of Ireland's nitrates management regime and the application, for the benefit of Irish farmers, of the new EU agricultural support arrangements; and—supports the Government's proposal to use the flexibility in the Directive to secure European Commission approval for limits of up to 250 kg/hectare per annum, on the basis agreed with the Farming Pillar under Sustaining Progress."I thank Deputy Timmins for tabling this motion because I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this very important issue in the House. While I might disagree with the motion, I thank the Members opposite for their calm and reasoned contributions this evening. On many of the issues, there are no major differences between the Government and Fine Gael. I will outline where we stand on the issue and where we are going with it.The Government's position on the implementation of the nitrates directive is based on the agreement reached with the farm organisations last year in the Sustaining Progress negotiations. The directive is about protecting our water quality from pollution, and this is an environmental objective of the greatest importance. Everybody in the House agrees on that. However, we must achieve this objective in an optimal and efficient way, and avoid imposing unnecessary burdens, costs or restrictions on any sector, including agriculture. I subscribe to that view.Most of the public debate on the matter in recent months has focused on the limits on the amount of organic nitrogen which can be spread on land. There is a requirement in the directive that each member state must set a general limit not exceeding 170 kg per hectare. However, the directive also allows member states to set higher limits where it can be shown that this will not result in water pollution. The Government's objective is exactly the same as that of the farm organisations — it believes the climate and soil conditions on most Irish grassland will justify limits of up to 250 kg per hectare. That is the view of most people who spoke here this evening. I confirm again that I subscribe to that view.Recent judgments of the European Court of Justice have made it clear that a member state cannot simply set the higher limit of its own accord — it must present the detailed scientific evidence to the European Commission and must secure the approval of the Commission for what is proposed. In that I have no choice. The court has removed several ambiguities which previously existed regarding the interpretation of the directive. We now know it is simply not permissible for a member state, acting at its own discretion, to set a general limit above 170 kg; the only way in which a higher limit can be applied is with the approval of the Commission.It has been represented that there is a difference between the Government and the farming organisations regarding the appropriate limit for Ireland, but that is not the case. The issue is about how we secure the appropriate limit, and the reality of European law is that there is only one way we can do this — by securing the Commission's agreement to a derogation. This is exactly what we agreed with the farm organisations in Sustaining Progress and it is what we are now doing.A first draft of the action programme was issued for public consultation last December, and the comments received have been taken into account in refining the programme. I now propose to issue the revised version before the end of June, so that stakeholders have a further opportunity to comment before it is finalised for submission to the European Commission. I intend to meet the farming organisations again shortly in association with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh.I also propose to appoint an independent adviser to review the comments which will be received and to make recommendations on how these can best be taken into account. I intend that this will be a person with the standing and credibility to command the trust and respect of all stake holders. I also intend that this adviser will have a continuing role in the consultation process on the detailed implementation of the action programme.I completely reject the claim in the Fine Gael motion that the Government has mismanaged its handling of the nitrates directive, or that it has failed to take any action on its implementation since 1997. The Government has at all times acted in a balanced and responsible manner regarding the implementation of the nitrates directive and will continue to do so.The directive was adopted in 1991 and was implemented at an early date in terms of the monitoring of waters and the promotion of good agricultural practice. An extensive range of measures was put in place to promote and support good agricultural practice. All Irish Governments from 1991, including a Fine Gael-led coalition, took the view that these measures met the requirements of the directive, given our generally good level of water quality.In 1996 the Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates was jointly developed by the then Departments of the Environment and Agriculture in consultation with the farm organisations. In 1998, however, water quality monitoring results indicated that certain groundwater might be affected by pollution by nitrates. Further investigations were carried out in 1999 and an expert panel recommended in May 2000 that vulnerable zones be designated under the nitrates directive in relation to the affected groundwater in five counties. This gave rise to a need to develop action programmes which would apply to the designated zones.In March 2001, an EPA assessment of water quality in 47 estuaries indicated that 17 of these estuaries were eutrophic or potentially eutrophic. This assessment, commissioned by my Department, gave rise to a need to review strategies to deal with water pollution from agriculture and from urban waste water treatment plants.In June 2001 regulations were made to designate an additional 30 water bodies as "sensitive areas" under the urban waste water treatment directive. The regulations require that discharges into these waters from large sewage treatment plants must be subjected to a higher level of treatment involving nutrient removal.Having regard to all available data on water quality in rivers, lakes and groundwater, my predecessor as Minister for the Environment and Local Government indicated his view in January 2002 that good agricultural practice needed to be strengthened in all areas and his preference for a "whole territory" approach to implementation of the nitrates directive. I subscribe to the "whole territory" approach.Following discussions and consultations with interested parties, the Government decided in January 2003 that an action programme under the nitrates directive should be applied on a "whole territory" basis. It was in that context that the commitment in Sustaining Progress was agreed. A draft of an action programme was issued for public consultation in December 2003. Following the consultation process, a revised draft is currently being finalised. I emphasise that no draft has been issued by me. No divisions have been issued around the country. There is no suggestion of closed periods, and no nonsense about not allowing spreading on weekends. None of this has been stated by me and no such report emanated from me. I make that clear.

I have also made that clear to the farming organisations. I have indicated to the farming organisations that I will discuss these matters with them. These are the people who are most directly affected. I am not living in an ivory tower seeking to undermine and destroy agriculture. Nothing could be further from the truth. They are the facts as I see them.We will shortly produce a draft programme and I will discuss it in some detail before it is formally submitted to the European Commission. In parallel with this process, the scientific case for a derogation on the landspreading limit is being prepared and will also go to the European Commission, as I have told the farming organisations and those involved in the debate in the House tonight. This sequence of decisions and actions clearly demonstrates an active, considered, consultative and balanced approach by the Government in addressing water quality problems.We have responded in the appropriate way to emerging evidence on specific water quality problems and to the firming up of the interpretation of the directive itself on foot of European Court of Justice judgments. The entire issue must be handled carefully, given the importance to Ireland both of our excellent water quality and our modern agriculture industry. I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, as indeed are our two Departments, to ensure we get the best possible outcome.There is now a widespread appreciation of the need to strengthen the application of good agricultural practice in order to protect the environment, especially water quality. All farming organisations have stated this publicly. Agriculture is a major economic activity in Ireland with a very substantial impact on the environment. It is estimated that agriculture generates 56 million tonnes of managed waste per annum and accounts for about three quarters of all waste generated in Ireland. The vast bulk of this waste is in the form of animal manure, slurry, silage effluent and soiled water, all of which have a high polluting potential. An additional 55 million tonnes of organic material is deposited directly on land by grazing animals. Livestock numbers are, in terms of pollution potential, equivalent to a human population of some 68 million persons.Agriculture also applied some 44,000 tonnes of chemical phosphorus and 388,000 tonnes of chemical nitrogen fertilisers to land in the most recent fertiliser year. Clearly there is a need to ensure that the use of these substances is properly managed. In that context, it is important that I should acknowledge and commend the responsible approach to the environment adopted by the vast majority of farmers. Tangible evidence is provided by the high level of investment by farmers in waste storage facilities and other infrastructure for pollution prevention. We simply would not have the high level of water quality we now enjoy if farmers generally were acting irresponsibly, which they are not.To put the level of investment in context, grant aid paid by the Department of Agriculture and Food from 1995 to date under the farm waste management scheme and its predecessors amounted to some €320 million, a not inconsiderable amount of money and equivalent to about €1 billion worth of investment overall. However, we still have challenges to address in combating water pollution. Successive reports by the Environmental Protection Agency illustrate these challenges.The most recent data indicate that 15% of lakes are unsatisfactory in terms of water quality; 23% of groundwater samples had nitrates levels in excess of the guideline values; 25% of groundwater samples showed faecal contamination; 30% of river channel is eutrophic; and 36% of estuaries are classified as eutrophic or potentially eutrophic. When the EPA report comes out to inform us that 94% of public water in this country is in excellent quality, I spend the next three or four weeks dealing with colleagues in other parties who cause a row about 6% of the water quality. There are issues but we cannot have it every way. A Deputy spoke earlier about group water schemes and in fairness to people involved in those, we are making great progress. It is a planned and measured approach.Agriculture is implicated by the EPA as a significant source, if not the dominant source, of pollution in all these waters. Eutrophication is caused mainly by the overenrichment of waters by excessive amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen. This leads to an imbalance in plant growth and a depletion of dissolved oxygen levels in water, which in turn impairs its capacity to sustain flora and fauna. Agriculture is the source of some 70% of phosphorus and 80% of nitrogen entering the relevant waters. Water needs to be protected against pollution emanating from all sources. Measures taken in any one sector cannot be effective on their own. Most sectors are now covered. We have a high level of protection in place regarding discharges from industry which are subject to licensing by the EPA and local authorities. Waste management activities are subject to a strict licensing regime under the Waste Management Acts. The water services investment programme is about to reach a point in 2005 when we will have met and surpassed all the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive. We have virtually eliminated the marketing of phosphate-based laundry detergents by virtue of a voluntary agreement with the detergents industry in 1999.Agriculture is the last major sector remaining largely unregulated in terms of environmental protection. We need to ensure that farming is carried on in a manner that maintains this protection. This objective is fully supported by the farm organisations which have made clear their own commitment, particularly in their support for the code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates. This code, of course, is voluntary. By definition, it is not possible to enforce compliance with a voluntary code of practice. In completing the implementation of the nitrates directive, we need to give a statutory basis to the already well established standards of good practice so as to give a higher level of protection to the environment.I will now look in some detail at what will be covered in the nitrates action programme. Last December, a draft programme was issued jointly for public consultation by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food. It set out a range of proposed measures to strengthen the application of good agricultural practice in all areas. These measures relate to matters such as the timing and procedures for the land application of fertilisers, which was raised tonight. There has to be flexibility on this. I have spoken to members of the farming community on the weather conditions in this country as late as November last year. There has to be a capacity within Irish agriculture to respond to these conditions. We have to work with the farming organisations so that we can do this. I accept that agriculture in this country is a grass-based industry and is very different to many European countries. That is why the derogations and flexibility mechanisms in the directive were made available when this was first agreed.We need a focused approach from everyone, irrespective of political affiliations, as well as the farming bodies to be absolutely certain that what we are submitting stands up scientifically. Many Members have questioned the issues that have been raised tonight. I want to see the facts as much as anyone else. We must have the capacity to protect and to ensure that Irish agriculture can continue to grow and remain a significant economic force in this country.Other measures include limits on the land application of fertilisers, livestock manure storage requirements and the monitoring of the effectiveness of such measures. Following the consultation process, both Departments have been refining the proposals, taking account of the comments received and also drawing on the technical and scientific advice of Teagasc. I have to get scientific advice from some credible organisation. At least the accusation cannot be made against me that this is being done by scientific experts solely from my Department. If that was the case it might be open to some bias. We need to examine this carefully and see what is being put forward. It has also been necessary to take account of some implications of recent European Court of Justice judgments in various cases taken against member states by the European Commission on the implementation of the directive, particularly the case against Ireland in which the judgment was given on 11 March last.The regulations which will be proposed under the action programme will establish certain basic requirements and principles which will apply nationwide. However, they will allow for flexibility where this is appropriate to reflect local or regional variations regarding factors such as soil conditions or climate. For example, it is likely that different waste storage requirements will apply in different areas. The basic principles underlying the directive are that organic fertiliser should be used in a manner which relates to the nutrient needs of the crop and the need to avoid water pollution, with which I do not believe anybody disagrees, and that the slurry storage capacity on a farm should cover at least the full period during which land-spreading is not appropriate. I take it there will be serious cost implications in terms of the methodologies used to achieve that. I and my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, want to work with farming bodies to ensure we achieve it.In keeping with the principle that the amount of slurry applied to land should not exceed the nutrient requirements of the crop, the regulations need to specify a limit on the amount of organic nitrogen which may be spread. There has been some misrepresentation of the terms of the nitrates directive and it has been suggested that we have discretion as to whether we adopt a general limit of 170 kg per hectare. That is a matter with which I wish to deal.The Fine Gael motion calls for a general limit of 210 kg, with derogations up to 250 kg, and some farm organisations have called for a general limit of 250 kg without a requirement for a derogation. Let me take this opportunity to remove any possible doubt. Annex III of the directive specifies a general limit of 170 kg. It goes on to make two important qualifications. First, member states may, in their first four-year action programme, allow a general limit of 210 kg. However, the European Court has ruled that this qualification is no longer applicable. It was intended to apply in the period immediately after the adoption of the directive in 1991. Member states were supposed to draw up their first action programmes by 1995 and would therefore have had the option of this 210 kg limit until 1999. Ireland did not do that so the matter is irrelevant. No other country has such a limit because we are now in post-1999 phase.The court has ruled that a member state cannot now, by virtue of not having had an action programme in the prescribed period, seek to avail of the higher general limit at this stage. That ruling applies to all countries, there is no exception. The second qualification, however, is of continuing relevance and provides the basis on which we will seek the derogation to apply 250 kg. Member states may fix higher limits on an ongoing basis provided that the amounts do not prejudice the directive's overall objective, to reduce water pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources and to prevent further such pollution. The higher limits must be justified on the basis of objective criteria, many of which were referred to tonight: long growing seasons, crops with high nitrogen uptake, high net precipitation and soils with exceptionally high denitrification capacity.There is not the slightest doubt that Ireland's climate and soil conditions satisfy the conditions for a higher limit in areas where it is necessary. The majority of Irish farmers operate within the lower limit. I appreciate that those who are operating at a higher level are among our most modern and progressive farmers and we need to ensure that unnecessary restrictions are not placed in their way. However, the process that must be followed is clearly defined. There had been some ambiguity about how this aspect of the directive was to be interpreted, particularly as regards whether the Commission's approval was required. Some countries applied a general 250 kg limit without a derogation having been received from the Commission. This ambiguity has now been removed by the European Court of Justice.In a case against the Netherlands last October, it ruled that the directive must be interpreted as requiring higher limits to have the approval of the Commission. In other words, a derogation must be sought based on the appropriate scientific evidence. It is not open to us to do it ourselves. It has always been our position that a limit of up to 250 kg is warranted and must be secured. We have accepted, however, that it would have to be achieved on the basis of a derogation. This was made clear to everyone in the text of Sustaining Progress, which was agreed by the farming organisations. The following is the exact wording of the relevant paragraph: "In the context of the regime soon to be adopted to transpose the provisions of the Nitrates Directive, the Government will also use the flexibility in the Directive to seek to secure European Commission approval for limits of up to 250 kg per hectare per annum to be allowable in appropriate circumstances."I will not demur one iota from what was agreed with the farming bodies. The only thing that has changed since that commitment was given is that the non-availability of the 210 kg general limit has been clarified. We had intended to avail of it and it was included in our first draft of the action programme. We have no choice but to apply a general limit of 170 kg but the needs of the farmers affected will be met by obtaining the derogation. The commitment made in Sustaining Progress is being honoured in full and the application for a derogation will be pursued in parallel with the submission of the action programme. The scientific case for the derogation will be based on the unique characteristics of Irish agriculture. It is being drawn up with the assistance of Teagasc and I have no doubt that it will fully justify the higher limit that we require.Another implication is that many farmers may be affected by the requirement to provide a certain minimum storage capacity for animal manure. There is known to be a significant deficit of waste storage capacity on Irish farms despite significant investment of recent years. The provision of adequate storage capacity is an essential feature of sustainable farm management and good farming practice. It is essential for a farmer to have adequate storage to ensure that slurry does not need to be spread at inappropriate times.Significant undertakings were made in Sustaining Progress to help farmers address these storage issues. The changes in the farm waste management scheme introduced this year ensures that the vast majority of Irish farmers will now be able to avail of grant aid to undertake the necessary improvements in manure storage facilities. Provision has been made for €30 million in the 2004 Estimates, an increase of almost 60% on the 2003 allocation. It is important to mention that an improved rural environment protection scheme, REPS 3, is now in place. It is anticipated that participation in the scheme will increase from the current level of 38,500 farmers to 59,000 farmers at the end of 2006. The provision for REPS in the 2004 Estimate is €260 million, an increase of more than 40%, a 28% increase in average payments to participants.I should spell out for the House the implications for Ireland, and Irish agriculture in particular, of our failure to respond adequately to the European Court of Justice judgment against us. While some of the counts on which we were ruled against have been addressed, and were addressed before the judgment was handed down, the key ruling in the present context is that we had not established action programmes which met the directive's requirements. Ireland had argued that the wide range of measures we had taken to improve water quality, particularly as regards good farming practice, could be taken as constituting an action programme. That was our position. The court rejected this and said that to comply with the directive an action programme must include the mandatory measures referred to, including the limitation on the amount of organic fertiliser that can be applied. This judgment against us, with the clarifications of the directive which have emerged from other European Court of Justice rulings, has put the European Commission in a very strong position to ensure that we comply in full with its requirements.The Commission could, in the first instance, return to the court to seek daily fines against Ireland if our response to the judgment is not satisfactory. Of even greater significance, however, is the implications for Ireland and Irish farmers under the new EU single payments system for agricultural supports. Under the single payments scheme, which will apply to virtually all farmers from next January, compliance with the nitrates directive will be one of the conditions of what is called cross-compliance. There will be a range of legislation with which farmers must comply as a condition of receiving the single payment. Apart from the possible impact for the individual farmer, if Ireland is found not to have made adequate arrangements to comply with the directive, the Commission has the power to impose a disallowance of funding under the single payment scheme while also threatening support for the CAP rural development plan measures. Given that expenditure of €1.7 billion is involved annually, the House will appreciate the potential severe cost to Ireland and Irish agriculture if we do not implement the directive satisfactorily.Compliance with the nitrates directive is not optional. However, the Government believes we can ensure compliance in a way which meets both important objectives, to protect water quality while also protecting the interests of Irish agriculture. I urge the farm organisations to work constructively, as they have done, with my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food and Teagasc to ensure that our action programme and application for a derogation are successful to that end. I have had numerous meetings with farming organisations on this important and complex topic. I believe that all parties understand the issues involved. I am resolved to continue to work towards achieving an accommodation which will meet the concerns of all interested parties, in particular farmers.

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	638	The most important aspect of the nitrates directive is its original purpose, namely, to ensure the quality of our water supply. The failure to implement the directive since 1999 is now, at the 11th hour, presenting something of a crisis situation. Surely that is not the way to do business. It is certainly not the way to inspire confidence in the decision-making capacity of this Government. The Minister has set out very clearly — and I tend to agree with him — that at this stage there is no option regarding the implementation of the directive as set out by the European Union. In March 2004, the European Court of Justice, as the Minister said, decided that Ireland was non-compliant.The consequences of that non-compliance are quite serious for this country. The tab for the daily fines arising will be very severe financially. The problem is that there is an additional threat that agricultural funding will be affected, something the Minister also pointed out. That is a totally unacceptable state of affairs for those people who are not responsible for polluting our water supply; nor is it fair to farmers who are endeavouring to put best agricultural practice in place and remain compliant. The failure to take the necessary action before now is coming home to roost, with hardship for people who have no responsibility for that state of affairs.The comment that has been made more than any other this evening relates to the scientific evaluation of the nitrates directive. I confess that I am totally confused in that regard. There is nothing short of total confusion, as far as I am concerned, regarding the evidence and counter-evidence that is being produced, seemingly in support of whatever point of view is being aired at any given time. I would like to know why the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have not been able to produce in a clear and unequivocal way the scientific reports of the State agency charged with the responsibility of advising on the use of organic nitrogen on the land, stocking levels and farm management. Is it the case that the experiment must be repeated until the correct result is arrived at? I simply do not understand the delay in the production of the scientific results that show the precise impact of the proposed regulations and limits.Just last week the chairman of Teagasc was reported as saying it was at an advanced stage in summarising its research results on key aspects of nutrient use and management, such as stocking rates, manure storage, handling and land application. It surprises me that there is a need to summarise the research results at this late stage in the game. I would have thought that they would be in place and available and that we would not be looking at a summary but rather that we would have the complete scientific facts in front of us.The Government makes no reference in its amendment to the scientific evaluation of the impact of the nitrates directive, although it has been referred to at length here. Surely such assessments have been made since 1997. The Ministers must have access to that information. Why is there such confusion and contradiction in the reporting? Why do we still await, at least according to the Irish Farmers’ Journal report, the summary of the Teagasc findings? The imposition of the new limits will affect about 5% of farmers quite significantly. Surely the Ministers have a responsibility to ensure that the appropriate derogation be put in place.It is true that derogations have been applied in the case of Denmark. I understood from Commissioner Fischler that such a derogation could not be ruled out for Ireland. Equally, there is no guarantee that it will be allowed. It is important to note that the draft action document will use the flexibility of the directive to secure approval for limits of up to 250 kg. per hectare in appropriate circumstances — that is the important part of that sentence. It is also true that, when such derogations are sought, and if they are accessed, the bureaucracy and red tape that have been thrust on the farming community up to now should at least be minimised. I hope that such derogations will not be a recipe for further red tape, should they be made available.The adoption of the whole territory report for the application of the directive as recommended is appropriate. Six other member states have also adopted that approach. It seems the only appropriate course to take based on the need to enforce, as the Minister has stated, several other realistic European directives which are also relevant. Something mentioned by almost everyone who spoke is the need to ensure that storage facilities and capacity, and quality of the storage conditions, are adequate. That will undoubtedly impose additional financial burdens on farmers to meet the specific requirements. While there are various financial supports in place, in meeting the requirements many farmers will undoubtedly suffer significant financial burdens on account of the capital cost that they will have to meet.The outcome of all the noise concerning the nitrates directive is that farmers and farming organisations have been misled. The Government has failed to come clean with them regarding what is called "the near final revised action plan". Furthermore, there is total confusion surrounding the role of Teagasc in its preparation. Some Teagasc researchers state that they were involved in drafting the plan, while others state that the revised plan is not a Teagasc document. We need clarity on that and on the negotiations between the stakeholders, namely, the farmers, the scientific advisers and the Minister. From my reading of it and the reports, particularly in such newspapers as the Irish Farmers’ Journal, I am totally confused about Teagasc’s role, the information that has been provided, whether we have total or summary information, and who has a role.

However, the Minister must agree with me about those reports.

I welcome the decision to invite Teagasc before the committee.

Their understandable concerns relate mainly to output costs and future income. However, water quality is the basis of the directive and it is the responsibility of this Government to ensure farmers are not undermined in their efforts to ensure their livelihoods. It is a parallel responsibility to guarantee a safe water supply.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	643	There are several aspects of the Fine Gael motion with which the Labour Party can agree, particularly the condemnation of the Government's incompetence and mismanagement of the nitrates directive, and its denunciation of the Government for its failure to take any action to implement the directive from 1997 to date and failing to build on the code of agricultural practice to protect water from nitrates pollution introduced by the rainbow Government in 1996.It is quite remarkable that it is 13 years since the nitrates directive was introduced in 1991. Given the European Court of Justice's decision in March this year, we are more at the 13th hour than at the 11th, with the nitrates directive not implemented and very serious implications arising from its implementation being presented to Irish agriculture and the section of farming most directly affected by it. We have the case of the European Court of Justice in March 2004 which could result in this country facing massive fines and farmers suffering financial loss if support payments are tied to the implementation of the directive.There is no doubt that the Government has mismanaged and mishandled the directive's implementation. It did so because up to now, with the decision of the European Court of Justice, it simply refused to bring the bad news to those most affected by it. Worse than that, it has seriously misled farmers. The Minister has effectively acknowledged that the delay in implementing the directive has now directly resulted in a situation where the 2010 regime can no longer apply since we are too late and it is no longer an option. It has not been an option since 1999.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	644	That is irrelevant. It finished everywhere in 1999.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	645	Clearly, Irish farmers were misled in the Sustaining Progress agreement. The Minister read out the text of the agreement. That text is capable of being interpreted in a number of ways. It is clear that the farm organisations interpret it as meaning that the Government would seek a general derogation of up to 2050 and that it was possible to achieve that derogation. I do not believe that experienced negotiators from the farm organisations sat at the Sustaining Progress talks and emerged without being clear in their minds as to what the text meant in practice. If they have concluded that the text meant that the maximum derogation was going to be sought and was achievable, it is because they were led to believe that during the discussions.It is therefore understandable that there is considerable anger among Irish farmers, or at least among the section that is likely to be directly affected by the directive. It has to be acknowledged that not all farmers will be affected by it. The anger is understandable given the implications for stocking levels, income, buildings and so on. However, it is important we do not lose sight of what the nitrates directive is about. It is about protecting the quality of our water.We have a serious problem in this country and there is no point in anybody trying to pretend that we do not. One of the fastest selling products in this country, including rural Ireland, is bottled water. The reason bottled water is selling so fast in rural Ireland is that increasing numbers of householders no longer trust the water supply delivered to their homes, whether through group water schemes or the public water supply.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	646	There is no evidence to suggest that.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	647	There is little comfort to be found in some of the material circulated in connection with the implementation of the nitrates directive, for example, the discussion document on the nitrates amendment circulated by the Minister's Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food. The Environment Protection Agency report, Water Quality in Ireland: 1998-2000, states that 30% of the river channel length in this country is affected by pollution to some extent — 17% slight, 12% moderate and 1% serious pollution. It states that elevated nitrate levels are recorded in approximately 20% of well sampling stations and high ammonia values were found in ground water across eight counties. The most recent EPA report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland, for 2001, indicates that breaches of the prescribed standard for nitrates in drinking water supplies, public and private, were recorded in 15 counties through Ireland — Carlow, Cavan, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.Two issues arise. There is the concern and anger felt among the section of Irish agriculture which is now expected in the 13th hour to implement the measures necessary to give effect to the nitrates directive. The blame rests with the Government for that because of its delay. There is also the concern throughout the country among people about the quality of the water. Life depends on good quality water. In this country, unfortunately, we have——

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	649	No, I do not want it both ways. I will be clear, whoever drafted the text of Sustaining Progress in the "Bertie language" in which it was written, wanted it both ways. He or she wanted on the one hand to talk about the implementation of the nitrates directive while on the other to give a misleading, as it has turned out, signal to the farm organisations that a derogation would be sought in appropriate circumstances. The term "appropriate circumstances" has many meanings. It is confirmed by the fact that the farm organisations are so firm in their view that they were given an agreement on something which has not turned out to be what they understood to be the case, and that they were misled. The most recent data from the Environment Protection Agency indicates that 15% of the lakes in this country are unsatisfactory in terms of water quality, 23% of ground water samples had nitrate levels in excess of the guideline values, 25% of ground water samples showed faecal contamination, 30% of river channels are eutrophic and 36% of estuaries are classified as eutrophic or potentially eutrophic.Apart from the issue of the consumption of water by the citizen, consideration must be given to the business associated with inland fisheries. This is seriously affected by the diminution in standards and the poor water quality. Anglers and angling organisations will tell us that the fish are not in the rivers or lakes anymore, that they have been polluted out of these waters. The recreational value of angling is diminishing, with the tourism-linked income that sustains local economies in many parts of the country.There are a number of issues to be considered. There is the mismanagement of the implementation of the directive by the Government, leading to a point where the farm organisations, in the 13th hour, were misled in the Sustaining Progress agreement and where the European Court of Justice has found against Ireland, with the country facing fines and financial loss as a result. There is the corresponding difficulty that we continue along these lines. There is no point in the Minister or anyone else trying to pretend that we do not have a problem with our water quality. Not much can be built on clutching at the last EPA report which showed some marginal improvement in surface water.

I appreciate that the Minister has said he intends to define "national monument", but the matter is not clearly dealt with in this Bill. It is important that such a definition be included in the Bill.Interpretation is a real problem in planning because different people have different views. One person might interpret something differently to another. Fine Gael sees a real problem in implementing the Bill because the definition of a national monument is not sufficiently clear. One of the issues at Carrickmines related to whether what was discovered constituted a national monument. That the debate was allowed to drag on shows that we face a mess in respect of road projects and national monuments.Fine Gael has a clear approach to the Bill and this general subject. It does not believe the creation of a proper road network and the preservation of our national heritage are mutually exclusive.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	653	I agree.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	654	In a country like Ireland, there is every chance that a road project will unearth something of importance. I referred earlier to the discoveries at Waterford. Historical monuments are discovered in most road projects throughout the country. Should projects be delayed? Should monuments and artefacts be taken away to be put on display elsewhere? The Romans did not come as far as Ireland in their day, but Roman ruins are preserved in other parts of Europe, particularly city centres.

Part of the old town is on display in the centre of Brussels. I appreciate what the Minister is saying. A strong argument has been made that the Carrickmines site would not have been found — it would have remained undiscovered for many years — if it had not been for the M50 motorway project. No requests were made for the preservation of the site at the beginning of the M50 works. We did not realise the importance of the site until the artefacts were discovered and their importance ascertained.Fine Gael believes it is important to preserve our past. Ireland would be a much poorer place without such preservation. The option is not to bulldoze and destroy, but preserve and remove, while allowing daily life to continue as it must. I referred to the national development plan when I spoke earlier about the roads projects that have to come on stream. We have a different style of life now. We have to decide whether to take artefacts away or to leave them on site.

That is written into the Act. I ask the Minister to read the Act — I am sure he is familiar with it. The Minister is introducing this Bill under the pretext of addressing the problems with the M50 at Carrickmines. The legislation, which is being rushed through in less than two weeks, will allow him to deal with any archaeological site, anywhere in the country. To say, ostensibly, that the Bill addresses a problem that arose at Carrickmines in south Dublin is a dangerous way to introduce legislation. The Bill will allow the Minister to intervene anywhere in the State, which is a dangerous precedent. The Minister could have examined other options if he had followed the advice about Carrickmines that I gave him in writing two years ago. I said back then, essentially, that the road can move but the castle cannot.

There is a real concern about the process by which the views of the director of the national museum are sought. The director is not given discretion in allowing the works to proceed, however, because the Minister can over-rule him or her. I do not believe that is the right way of doing things. I am concerned by the time limits in the Bill. Decisions have to be made within 14 days, which is far too short a time frame to deal with issues relating to our heritage.

I do not see any sign of that on my preliminary reading of the Bill. I am concerned that this Bill, while being justified as an attempt to deal with the impasse at Carrickmines, will allow a Minister to do what he or she wants to disfigure, deface, injure or interfere with a national monument in a way that is unprecedented.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	727	They did, but the Minister must remember that if Mayo County Council had got away with what it proposed at the time, it would not have gone ahead. The Minister was in Westport House, one of the few remaining country homes that has not been bought by the private sector or destroyed and built on by developers, as happened in Castlebar in respect of a listed building — there was a mix-up over documentation and a listed building was knocked down. My political office is in a listed building. It can restrict one in certain ways but there is nothing wrong with that because it ensures that I or any other person who buys such a property is obliged to ensure that whatever we do within the planning process is done within the law, and agencies have to be in place to deal with that.I did not come in here to talk about Westport House but I am reminded of something. The Minister was not the Minister for the Environment at the time I refer to, it was Deputy Howlin. I complimented the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, at the time because Mayo County Council wanted to bring that further into the estate but, to be fair to the then Department of the Environment, officials went down to the area with the then Minister's programme manager and worked out an agreement.I was in favour of the Westport sewerage scheme when we were in government from 1995 to 1997 — it was in the programme for Government. I cannot remember the title but we put it in the plan for 1996 to 1999 and for the first time it got moving. To be fair, the current Minister and previous Governments played their part in terms of that scheme. However, major problems arose with the management and the owner, Jeremy Browne, or Lord Altamont as he is known, who has done more for Westport over the years than Bord Fáilte, Ireland West Tourism or any of the tourist agencies. He promoted and restored Westport House with very little grant aid from the State at a time when it was difficult to get funding. He experienced major difficulty because of the way the property was tied up and a Bill went through the Seanad and the Dáil to deal with that serious legal issue — the property had to be passed on to his first son but he had only daughters. The Minister will recall that Bill going through the Dáil.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	728	I think I brought it through the Houses.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	729	That issue was dealt with. It is wonderful that Westport House is still there and thousands of people every year have the pleasure of visiting what is probably one of our most historical buildings. It is regrettable that many of the artefacts were removed from the house and sold abroad. At the time I put pressure on the State to buy them. It bought some of them in past years, and I am delighted about that. The house is now in State ownership.I have pushed for the State to work in partnership with Lord Altamont. There should be a partnership in that regard. There should not be conflict. There has been conflict over many years between members of Mayo County Council and Lord Altamont regarding the estate, instead of trying to talk to him and assist him.It is important to keep that estate up and running. The Minister visited a site in the area on a beautiful day. He travelled down the road and turned into the right. Lord Altamont applied to Mayo County Council for planning permission on two or three occasions but because he opposed the location of a treatment plant in the middle of his land right behind his house, he found it difficult to get planning permission. That is wrong. The council should be working with him rather than against him.This legislation is not all good, but it is not all bad. What happened in regard to Carrickmines was something that could not continue. Somebody had to step in. The courts made a decision and that is the reason we are dealing with this legislation. There was also a case in another part of the country where the protection of a particular snail held up progress on the completion of a road. We cannot allow such delays. We need development, but a proper balance must be struck. A proper balance needs to be introduced to this legislation. There are dedicated, environmentally aware people who want to ensure that whatever heritage can be preserved is preserved, but there is also an element of people who want to object and hold up the construction of roads for the sake of doing so.We need infrastructural development but if there is an archaeological find, there should be some procedure in place to deal with it quickly. If it can be saved and the State can play its part in doing so, that should be done. The spokespersons from all parties will go through the Bill in detail on Committee Stage and I hope the necessary amendments are made to ensure the State agencies have the necessary powers in this regard.I am concerned that in the last 20 years, power has been taken from the Dáil and elected representatives and handed over to officials who are not answerable to anyone. One issue that came up on the doorsteps during the recent elections, particularly in rural areas, was that power was being taken from local authorities and given to non-elected officials who are not answerable to this House or to the people.This Bill gives power to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to override State agencies that have been established to protect our national heritage. I am not one who wishes to see heritage concerns go before people's concerns. However, I have seen the vandalism carried out on many historic estates and buildings. There are examples of builders knocking historic buildings on a Sunday night to make way for further housing developments. These buildings should have been protected by the State agencies. However, when the State does not do its job, there is no other way to deal with such vandalism. The State will always protect itself, particularly in the courts. The more I see of the performances of courts, the more I am convinced they are not working. One wonders sometimes if the judges actually know what is happening. Judges must have experience of the cases they are dealing with, whether they involve heritage and environmental protection or the family courts.I dislike emergency legislation. I prefer well-thought out legislation that allows the Opposition an opportunity to fully examine it and put down amendments. However, this Bill will remove powers from certain agencies. Deputy Cullen's full ministerial title is Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. However, it is hard to see how a portfolio containing both heritage and local government responsibilities can work without conflict. Both portfolios should be separated to allow for one Minister responsible for the environment and local government and another for heritage and avoid any conflict between the two. Though I disliked the former ministerial portfolio for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, it was a better arrangement than this one.This Bill gives too much power to the Minister. Over the years, we have seen those in the building industry gain more powers than elected representatives. There would not be half as many tribunals of inquiry if this was not the case. In a few weeks, that power will be seen again at the Galway races. Builders will be running into tents, fat with all the money bulging out of their pockets, but emerging thin because the money will be put into the bags of others. Their interests are more important than our national heritage. This Bill should not be rushed through the Dáil. Damn all of our national heritage is left because much of it has been demolished when it should have been protected by the State. What little is left must be protected.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	730	The National Monuments (Amendment) Bill was not introduced out of any concern for national monuments or the environment but more out of an indecent haste to speed up and facilitate the completion of the south-east section of the M50 motorway. The M50 motorway, conceived in the 1970s as a circular route around Dublin, was to serve all national primary routes serving the capital city. However, it was recently described as the only motorway in the world with a cul-de-sac in the middle. While practically completed at each end, it has been held up in the middle at Carrickmines due to archaeological considerations in the area of Carrickmines Castle.Had the motorway proceeded as planned, unwarranted and major vandalism would have been visited on what remains of the castle and its artefacts. The "Carrickminders" have a case and their concern for this part of our heritage has been vindicated in court on several occasions. In the interests of completing the roads network in the area, it is vital to facilitate the completion of this motorway, while preserving the archaeological remains. The delay in progressing this motorway has lasted for more than ten years. What should have been completed ten years ago has now cost an additional €55 million. Croatia, whose application to join the EU was recently granted candidate status, added no less than 88 miles of motorway to its already vast and comprehensive motorway system this year.As Deputy Gilmore has pointed out, delays concerning alternative routes for the M50 had major implications for Leopardstown Racecourse. The ten-year delay was also caused by the alterations of the previous Dublin County Council plans, involving a somewhat more modest motorway to Sandyford, and a distributor road to the N11 at Leopardstown. A series of environmental impact statements followed on alternate routes, which also went to a plebiscite of residents. Any self-respecting environmental impact statements should have established the difficulties that would subsequently arise concerning the castle and the extensive site surrounding it. How could such a study not take cognisance of such a site that has been compared in its significance to the Wood Quay site that sparked so much domestic and international controversy in the mid-1970s?This study was followed by a public inquiry in Dún Laoghaire Town Hall which further contributed to the enormous expense and delay. However, there were no results to show as it turned out to be an exercise in futility. Most observations and suggestions from the public were not taken seriously as mere lay people were not considered to have a constructive idea or contribution to make about the roads system or the local road infrastructure in their area. However, a well-briefed local group, the southern cross motorway study, made a positive and lasting contribution to the motorway debate. The group, comprising local residents including architects, engineers and other professionals, briefed local representatives in the mid-1970s so successfully that the remainder of the then Dublin County Council was convinced to unanimously defeat the council's roads planners' proposal to bisect Marlay Park with a proposed motorway on a unanimous 18-0 vote.The nightly traffic reports of motorised chaos in the areas of Ballinteer, Dundrum and Sandyford Industrial Estate all emanate from the failure of successive county councils to anticipate upcoming road blocks. The former Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council both failed to notice the archaeological significance of Carrickmines Castle when planning the motorway.However, this Bill is not just concerned with expediting the completion of the M50 motorway and its provisions are considerably more wide-ranging. The Bill allocates or subdivides powers relating to national monuments among the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Arts, Sport and Tourism, and Finance, and the Office of Public Works. That the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have vested powers to direct that national monuments may be injured or destroyed borders on the sacrilegious. The excuse given for such potential acts of vandalism is the consideration of the wider public interest. How wide is "wide" and who determines the "width" of the public interest?The Minister may consider archaeological considerations but will not be restricted to this by the Bill. He will be empowered, just like the Dún Laoghaire environmental impact study and public inquiry process, to ignore such archaeological data and concentrate on what he considers the wider public interest requires. This will permit the Minister to issue orders that all items of archaeological interest or significance that may block a particular development be destroyed. These would undoubtedly be items of enormous significance to our heritage. To destroy them at the stroke of a ministerial pen is bordering on the criminal.It is abundantly clear from this that all archaeological sites, finds or artefacts are to be subjugated to what the Minister would feel is not in accordance with the wider public interest. In other words, archaeological or historic sites are considered secondary or subordinated to the provision of motorways, for example. School educational tours are organised to heritage sites around the country because educationalists realise the importance of inculcating respect for our heritage among our youth.Heritage tourism is another aspect that should not be lost sight of. Numerous organised tours from abroad flock to Ireland each year, attracted by the heritage, culture and history of Ireland. This heritage tourism represents a significant contribution to the national income and is widely publicised among the Irish diaspora and other nationalities. Monuments are central to the tourism industry. People are always interested in the history, culture and heritage of the countries they visit, and Ireland is no exception.Since this Bill is specifically about national monuments and their impact on a particular motorway, it can be taken that it will be used in respect of future motorway projects. One motorway that has aroused a considerable amount of controversy and public feeling is the proposed M3. I understand that the M3 scheme has been agreed and that it is inviolable. It is difficult to fathom how the scheme could be objectively re-evaluated in this situation. Perhaps if a modicum of flexibility and consultation were undertaken in relation to the M3 there might have been a prospect of some agreement being reached about the line of this motorway. There was no evidence of any will to listen to rational suggestions from conservationists to preserve the archaeological sites and treasures that have been discovered there.The archaeological finds in this area were recently described as among the world's most significant, even more so than Pharaoh's tombs and the Chinese terracotta warriors. If they are treated under the terms of this Bill it is likely that they will be bulldozed indiscriminately at the behest of the Minister because of the "wider" public interest. The line of the motorway appears to be sacrosanct, to the exclusion of all heritage or archaeological items at the Minister's discretion.Some of our monuments are wide open to being stolen by avaricious individuals and even companies and groups obsessed with transporting Irish artefacts abroad. We have had examples of this in my constituency of north Monaghan where a mass rock on the Bragan mountain was stolen. A penal cross remains on that mountain and it too is vulnerable and unprotected. It is possible that the thieves may return and take the cross too. Many of these items end up in the private residences of individuals and on occasions in corporate offices as a backdrop to their corporate business. It is time we wised up to the illicit trade in items of Irish archaeological and heritage interest that are disappearing and reappearing in the homes and offices of wealthy individuals abroad. It is somewhat remiss of the Government and typical of the attitude to national monuments inherent in this Bill that little or no effort is made to prevent illicit trade in items of heritage or archaeological interest or significance.The Bill provides for consultation by the Minister with the director of the National Museum. This would appear to be another cosmetic exercise because it merely allows the director 14 days to reply to the Minister's so-called attempt at consultation. He has to reply in 14 days, having examined, over a period of little more than a week, the implications of a particular archaeological issue that may have taken years to discover. One can understand the need for urgency and haste in such matters, but 14 days is a ridiculously short period of time in which to adequately evaluate the feasibility or otherwise of a particular heritage item. National monuments are a reflection of our past, the glorious and inglorious, the tragic and the triumphant, and it is important that legislation should be in place to protect and preserve them.Regarding the progressing of motorway projects to enhance the roads infrastructure, I am fully in favour of providing the highest quality of roads. However, when the progress of such a system conflicts with the preservation of heritage sites or national monuments, every effort should be made to reach an accommodation between the two. It is a case of preservation of our heritage balanced against what is regarded as "progress" in the matters of roads. There should be no question of the Minister having power to destroy national monuments if they conflict with what he deems to be the wider public interest. The wider public interest would appear to be the development of motorways as part of an integrated road infrastructure system. There is no doubt however that archaeological excavations should be carried out, and the ultimate care taken to ensure that our archaeological heritage is not undermined.The Bill's provisions to permit the completion of the M50 are to be welcomed. However, the other wide-ranging powers to be given to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the area of heritage should be regarded with the utmost caution. I agree with an earlier speaker who stated that emergency legislation does not make for good law.

The cynicism of the Government's approach is glaringly exposed in the print on the Bill itself, dated 11 June 2004, the day of the local and European elections. The Government dared not publish this regressive Bill before the elections because it knew it would become a major issue and that it would receive an even bigger mauling at the hands of the electorate. The Bill was published on polling day. Shame on the Government for forcing through this profound change in our heritage legislation, with a guillotine in the Dáil tonight and a rushed-through Committee Stage tomorrow.This Bill was hatched in secret. There was no consultation and no opportunity for proper scrutiny in the Oireachtas and there is no time for an informed public debate outside this House. The Government would like to pretend that the Bill is about Carrickmines, and certainly it is, but as other speakers have pointed out, it uses that experience as an opportunity to give sweeping new powers to the Minister. These powers threaten our national monuments and national heritage, and it is of no comfort to us that the Minister proclaims that it will be exercised with care. It puts powers in the hands of this and future Ministers to allow the destruction of national monuments so that roads can be run through them regardless of the loss to our national heritage. This is retrospective approval for the destruction that has already been carried out at Carrickmines and a recipe for the destruction of national monuments in the future.I will quote a legal opinion on the Bill, which the Minister should note:It is difficult to believe that a determination to frustrate legal challenge is not one of the reasons for the remarkable restriction on the Minister's consultation with the Director of the National Museum. "The period of consultation shall be not more than 14 days from the day the consultation process was commenced by the Minister, or such other period as may in any particular case be agreed to between the Minister and the Director of the National Museum of Ireland." This is a euphemistic roundabout way of saying that the Minister can refuse to assent to any extension of the period. This is particularly objectionable in the light of the fact that there is no other dedicated consultation process or requirement of public notification or public consultation.I would like to hear the Minister's response to this.We must ask what is the driving force behind this Bill. It is certainly not the protection of heritage or the environment, nor is it good planning. The driving force is the powerful development lobby which has ensured that the Government's transport policy is almost totally concentrated on road construction. Vast swathes of the country, including the constituency I represent, are deprived of public transport, without a railway line or an adequate public bus service. We have had to campaign over many years to improve our non-national and national roads. Because they do not serve the prosperous south and east, development of our national routes, the N2 and N3, has been subject to continuous delay, not because of the presence of national monuments heretofore — though the issue arises on the N3 — but because of lack of will on the part of the Government and the prioritisation by the NRA of works in the east and south of the island.We want integrated transport development, including public transport and the development of the N2 and N3. However, we do not want unbridled development at the expense of our heritage and environment. The route of the N3 through an international heritage site at Tara, Ireland's valley of the kings, is not acceptable and should be redrawn. Yet, the Bill provides the Minister with the means to force through such projects.I note in passing the sharp differences in attitude between Fine Gael and their proposed partners in any future alternative being presented in a general election. As the Labour Party and the Green Party have shown their clear opposition, Fine Gael has taken a strange position on the Bill.

I roundly reject it.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	734	It is undisputed that the Bill has been brought forward as a result of the impasse at Carrickmines. However, it will have consequences for the heritage of the State that go far beyond the situation at Carrickmines. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is exploiting the Carrickmines situation to introduce legislation which will substantially reduce heritage protection. The legislation is being rushed through the Dáil. The Bill is to be guillotined tonight and it is proceeding to Committee Stage in the morning. There was no prior consultation with interested parties despite the fact that this legislation will fundamentally change heritage protection systems in the State. Justifiably, many ask if the National Roads Authority played a role in the drafting of the legislation. The Minister needs to address this suspicion and must explain his failure to hold consultations regarding the legislation.Resolution of the conflict between those seeking to protect our heritage and those involved in infrastructure construction can only be assured if there is an inclusive process of consultation involving all interested parties. Understanding the mistakes made in the case of the proposed Carrickmines interchange will provide a far better solution to preventing such situations recurring than the introduction of this legislation, which seeks to scrap heritage protection and give sweeping powers to a Minister who has a close affinity with the National Roads Authority.The Minister cares little for heritage protection. After all, he abolished Dúchas and under his watch heritage across the State is under threat. From Tara's green valley to Trim Castle to the round tower in Clondalkin, the Minister has propagated an anti-heritage ethos which puts the profit and interests of developers before all else.The reported inquiry of the European Commission into the south-eastern motorway shed some light on the Carrickmines debacle. It found a number of shortcomings in the environmental impact study, including a defective, non-technical summary, under estimations or omissions regarding the impact of the development, an insufficient historical study and a lack of schematic maps. The report states:Given that the EIS made it clear that the site might be larger, it failed to give evidence to judge to what extent that might be the case or to explain or quantify the effects or the consequences were it to prove so. Thus, the reader would not have had a clear view of the significance of the effects.The report goes on to assess the archaeological input into the environmental assessment process and found a number of errors which had serious consequences, including the fact that the site was not afforded a full historical, topographical study which might have suggested serious historical interest and its uncertain extent. It went on to state that the necessary sources for these studies were readily available. The report raises very pertinent questions regarding why the very large roundabout at the Carrickmines interchange became such an unalterable component of the south-eastern motorway development, even when the archaeological consequences became fully apparent. The report also states that, at one point, consideration of risk to Leopardstown racecourse seemed to have been given more prominence in the consultants' report than the risk to the cultural heritage.The lesson to be learned from Carrickmines and the European Commission report into the early stages of the development is that giving more leeway to the destruction of national monuments will not address any of the failures which brought about the Carrickmines situation. In fact, this legislation will increase the likelihood that developers will be less thorough in carrying out initial investigations into the possible implications for heritage, safe in the knowledge that, should they encounter a national monument, the Minister has wide ranging powers to consent to the destruction of monuments. Shamefully, provisions in the Bill allow the Minister to grant consent to carry out works to a national monument which may result in the destruction of part or all of the monument after archaeological work has been carried out.It has been claimed with some merit that the Bill will legalise badly designed roads. It provides no disincentives to unscrupulous developers who wish to push projects through in a way that suits their own desires to make fast profits regardless of whether they cut through heritage sites. They remain safe in the knowledge that they will ultimately be permitted to destroy national monuments. It is important to note that alternatives to both the Carrickmines interchange and the M3 motorway were put forward by conservationists seeking to preserve these sites. The current legislation will result in a situation where developers will have no motivation to compromise. History and heritage obviously have no worth for those committed to unbridled capitalism and the supremacy of the free market. The Bill devalues our national heritage and, consequently, Sinn Féin will oppose it.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	735	The Bill raises the ghost of the Fianna Fáil Taca gang of the 1960s. If we remember, this group laid siege to Georgian heritage in Dublin, wanting to replace it with monstrous concrete and glass structures. They enjoyed the political patronage of Fianna Fáil, which they bought with the lucre gained from heritage destroying speculation. They did enormous damage to the heritage of our national capital.The modern Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government try to do things with a bit more subtlety. However, at the end of the day, they serve the same masters — the speculators, the big contractors and the big developers, whose main and, in many cases, only aim is the maximisation of profit rather than the well-being of our community and, in this case, our heritage. The Bill is designed to make sure that no repository of our national heritage, even if thousands of years old, will stand in the way of plans to construct anything from roads to hotels or housing estates — whatever might be the particular project of the developers in question.The Bill gives the Minister draconian powers. Using the excuse of Carrickmines, the Minister brings this Bill forward as a Trojan horse to give him powers to make possible the destruction, at his whim alone, of national monuments which could in many cases be of great antiquity. Section 4, which replaces the equivalent section in the 1930 Act, puts the functions previously vested in the Commissioners of Public Works in the hands of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There are no safeguards envisaged in sections 4 and 5. It is entirely a decision for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The Bill makes possible the destruction of any location or object of antiquity, should the Minister decide it is in the public interest. It is clear that the term "in the public interest" is intended to mean the interest of development and building infrastructure in a particular location and within a particular timescale. In other words, it is intended to have a very narrow meaning, facilitating developers and those who may be in the business simply for a quick buck, rather than having the meaning of the wider public interest, namely, preserving our historic heritage and architectural sites of great antiquity. The Bill gives to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government totalitarian powers to destroy national heritage sites. The pathetic excuse of consultation with the director of the National Museum, in the pathetic timescale allowed, puts no obligation on the Minister to take advice from this or any other source.The people of Ireland, in wishing to protect their national historical antiquities, can have no confidence whatsoever in the leadership of the present Government. The lead for the heritage destruction powers vested in the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the Bill comes right from the top. It comes from the Taoiseach and the Cabinet committee on infrastructure. In remarks made more than once, the Taoiseach described in the most insulting terms those who value conservation of our natural environment, our ecosystems and our national heritage. The Taoiseach poured scorn on them on many occasions rather than taking seriously how important these considerations are to the heritage of our society and to the future heritage of our people.In the past two days, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in interjections made in the course of the debate, indicated his ignorance of ancient heritage and the value of heritage sites. He referred on a number occasions to going to Carrickmines and being more than surprised not to find a castle-like structure to greet him. If George W. Bush wandered out to Carrickmines, we can imagine him exclaiming, "Gee, where is the castle?"

However, when we find these attitudes starting at the very top, at prime ministerial level, it is no wonder we have an individual bringing his bulldozer onto a site at Dún Mór near Coomeenole in Corca Dhuibhne to destroy Bronze Age ramparts dating back to approximately 1000 BC. The Minister might ask, "What Bronze Age site? I only flattened a few earth ditches."The Minister is determined that any road the National Roads Authority wishes to drive through our national heritage will go through. The ancient history of Tara Na Rí is an inconvenience to the road builders, therefore, there is a threat to dozens of crucial national heritage sites in the Tara area. We are expected to put our entire trust in the Minister to stand between the destruction of these sites and the developers.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I will not allow it to happen.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	756	If the Minister is serious, he will institutionalise in legislation proposals and possibilities for dialogue with the archaeological community who are intimately involved in the protection of our national heritage, and put in place mechanisms by which these heritage sites will be protected and around which road routes and developments will be built. However, other considerations often intrude. Why was a roundabout sited at the location of the ancient Carrickmines Castle? It was done to facilitate the future development of lands which were corruptly rezoned. Similarly, there are other interests, above all the maximisation of profit by private individuals, driving the agenda.I was struck by the short-sightedness of some people, such as one of the Fine Gael speakers, who believe that this legislation will resolve the traffic jams in the vicinity of Carrickmines. I live beside the M50 motorway and for hours every morning, evening and weekends, it is a solid traffic jam. There is plenty of road but nowhere to go. That is due to the dependency on roads as opposed to providing for public transport and for rail transport. The controversy that has developed about the Tara area is ironic given that there is an unused rail line which could extend from Blanchardstown into County Meath.This is a sinister Bill and it will be a bad day's work if it is passed by the House. The Bill calculatedly cuts out the archaeological community and other genuinely interested parties from effective decision-making in the protection of our national heritage. That is extremely serious.Tubaiste mhillteanach dár n-oidhreacht náisiúnta a bheidh ann má ligtear don Bhille seo dul tríd an Dáil anocht.

The mohaired men and Fianna Fáil supporters in the Taca and related organisations wanted to lay waste to Georgian Dublin and replace it with piles of concrete and glass to bolster their profits. The response of the then Fianna Fáil Government was to introduce repressive legislation to stop the citizens who were protecting our national heritage. We owe those people a huge debt of gratitude that they stood up and fought because, despite losing some important heritage, they made our society aware of the need to protect a great deal more.This Minister is dictated to by a Taoiseach who speaks scornfully about people who wish to protect various ecosystems and various forms of life——

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	761	Ireland has a rich heritage which is certain to be affected by the unprecedented development activity that is taking place at present. We cannot always avoid such impacts so we must devise policies and strategies to deal with this issue. Mechanisms are in place to achieve these aims, including an administrative and professional structure.Development and conservation can happily co-exist as long as there is a common understanding of basic guiding principles. Early planning is an essential element in striking the right balance and this Bill is consistent with such principles. In issuing the consent in 2003, which was subsequently found to be invalid, a clear signal was given at that stage that the Government wants the M50 completed as soon as possible. There are significant public interest factors relating to safety and the economy that influenced that decision as well as the fact that extensive archaeological work has already taken place in Carrickmines. Just under €7 million is being spent in Carrickmines and more than 130 archaeologists are employed there.The Bill addresses the technical glitch identified by the High Court that prevented the M50 from being completed. In addition, the legislation must provide a proper framework for balancing heritage protection with development of other projects. The Bill restates many of the consent provisions of the 1930 Act. It provides a clear, single-tier consent process which overcomes existing arrangements that were described by the Chief Justice in the Supreme Court hearing as "torturous". The Bill also provides clear criteria to be considered in assessing an application for consent consistent with best regulatory practice. It simplifies the approvals process by removing the need for separate excavation and other licences where a consent is granted and allows for newly discovered national monuments not anticipated at EIS stage to be dealt with. Others who do not support the Bill do not want a process in place to deal with them. Importantly, Carrickmines and other affected national monuments on the SEM will be specifically exempted from the need for consent.I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate. While there are many issues which divide us, potential consensus emerged. There was general agreement that the M50 must be completed without further delay. We are also united in our belief that heritage is fundamentally important even if there are disagreements on how its protection should be enshrined in law. I reassure those Deputies who have fears about this legislation. Deputy Morgan considered the Bill anti-heritage, but the opposite is the case. It does not permit damage to archaeology, even after the necessary approvals have been received in the planning process, without ministerial approval. The penalties for damaging a national monument have been dramatically increased. Deputies Cowley and Gilmore believe the Bill gives me an unfettered power and Deputy Haughey sought assurance that I am not taking extra powers under the Bill. The existing legislation already provides for these powers. It was found to be inoperable because of a consent and a technical glitch.The Bill changes the status quo through its introduction under section 14 of the requirement for consultation with the director of the National Museum. This requirement did not exist before. Although I am introducing a consent process, I am being accused of doing the opposite. I can clearly show that these powers did not exist in the Acts at all.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	763	Contributions from Deputies Durkan, Sargent and Morgan mentioned the need for better analysis in identifying monuments in advance to avoid problems in the future. I agree, but I must emphasise that Ireland is to the fore in Europe in site identification. The Archaeological Survey of Ireland has received tremendous praise abroad. The results of surveys have caused 120,000 sites to be given statutory protection. There is no other country in Europe that approaches our level of heritage protection.The code of practice with the NRA has set up much improved advance systems and testing of routes for archaeology purposes. The fact remains, however, that we are undertaking the biggest investment in infrastructure in the history of the State and new sites are bound to be discovered, given that much material of archaeological interest is underground and unknown.I have great sympathy with the concerns of Deputy Olivia Mitchell as raised in her thoughtful contribution and appreciate her recognition that a single-section Bill dealing with Carrickmines alone would not be sufficient to deal with future cases.

I agree with the Deputy that there is a need to put in place a mechanism to define national monuments. There is a need to update and consolidate all the National Monuments Acts by creating one new Act. There will be further opportunities to consider the whole code at that stage, including a scheme for designating monuments of national importance. These are complex issues and for these reasons it would not have been possible to address them comprehensively in the context of this current Bill. In the meantime, the Department will continue to play its pivotal role in the protection of archaeological heritage through the many functions it performs and the various initiatives with which it is involved.Deputy Allen was the first to raise the issue of the promontory fort in north County Kerry.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	771	The fort is of national significance and is one of 120,000 sites in the Record of Monuments and Places. The Department has been in discussion with the land owner since August 2002, when other disturbances to the site were brought to our attention. The extent and significance of this site were explained in detail to him during a visit to the site in 2003 and in various correspondence. Attempts were being made to agree a plan with him to ensure he would be able to farm his land in a manner consistent with the protection of the monument. He appeared to be willing to co-operate in operating a plan which would protect the monument. In these circumstances, a preservation order was not put on the site.In light of the recent reports of damage, an official inspection of the fort was carried out on 21 June. It has been confirmed that a section of double-earth bank with intervening ditch measuring approximately 82 m. in length has been levelled in the recent past. This double entrenchment formed part of the eastern boundary of the promontory fort which ran north-south on the landward side of the headland. These earthworks may belong to the later prehistoric period or, at the very latest, to the early mediaeval period, between the sixth and eleventh centuries, when many of the promontory forts in the country were in use. In addition, damage to other sections of the earthworks had been caused and a number of later field boundaries were also removed. The old stone, contrary to media reports, has not been disturbed.The Department has asked the Garda to investigate the matter and pursue a prosecution under the National Monuments Acts. The only breach would be for lack of notification of works affecting the monument. Although the owner might claim that his discussions with the Department represent a form of notification, this would not apply to all the activity on the site. There are no penalties in the present Act for damage caused to a recorded monument. The consolidated legislation will address this. In addition, a submission has been made to have a preservation order placed on the remaining monument.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	777	Under this Bill I have raised penalties substantially, from €50,000 to €10 million. The present legislation is weak — I accept that. That is why we are trying to resolve this issue by bringing in a fully consolidated Bill. I agree with many Members about the need for a system to define national monuments, although it will be difficult. We will have to make a serious attempt at this but it is not always possible to define things satisfactorily even with the best available technology. That is what this extra legislation seeks to do. During the building of the N25 in Waterford I saw the technology that was used to try to establish what was there. It was not until the archaeologists went on site and began to dig that they could achieve this. The more they got into the site, the more they found.I will not allow to stand on the record of the House some notion that I am a vandal. It was ironic that Deputy Higgins referred to the Céide Fields. I had direct responsibility in that project and accepted the medals and honours on behalf of the OPW when it was completed. The projects in which I have been involved are worthwhile and I am glad to hear Deputy Higgins pronounce upon that tonight. My track record over the five years before I was given my current appointment stands up to scrutiny by anyone.

There are no wider powers. I am at pains to explain this to the House.One aspect of the existing legislation with which I have difficulty is the archaic language used. The 1930 Act contains the words "to demolish or remove wholly or in part or to disfigure, deface, alter, or in any manner injure or interfere with any such national monument". This is what is already in our Acts; it is not something I have brought in.One of the reasons we need to redefine and consolidate the Acts is that archaeology, in terms of the existing Acts, was defined as a find occurring in certain circumstances. However, archaeology in this country is now development-led and we need a statutory framework to deal with that. We need to introduce consultative processes. Some of the comments made during this debate have been grossly unfair to all the archaeologists involved with the Department of the Environment and other Departments.

A school inspection to determine the number of pupils enrolled at the school was carried out on 30 September 2003. The number of pupils enrolled on that date determined the number of teachers allocated to the school the following September. However, the number of pupils enrolled at Knocknagrave national school at that time dropped below the two-teacher requirement for a period of eight school days. In mid-October 2003, 13 pupils were enrolled at the school, well in excess of that required for the allocation of two teachers the following September. The school principal has indicated that the number of pupils who attending the school in September 2004 would be 18, an indication of the growing number of pupils enrolling at the school.A number of houses have recently been built in the area and planning permission is currently being sought for five more houses, an indication of a healthy future for that rural community. The board of management appealed the decision to remove one of its two teachers next September and had great faith in the process because they felt they had a good case. However, they were bitterly disappointed to discover the appeals board was sticking rigidly to the number of pupils enrolled on the particular day in 2003 when the number dipped below that required.Many letters ensued between the Minister, the Department of Education and Science appeals board and the Taoiseach, all of whom stonewalled the school's case. I am requesting that temporary cover be provided in cases such as that which arose at this school. The system should not be so rigid as to reject such appeals. The Department should consider that an additional 18 pupils are now enrolled at the school, bringing the number to that required for a second teacher. If a second permanent teacher cannot be allocated to the school the Department should provide a temporary or substitute teacher for the 12 months involved. Such a post could also provide a student studying for a higher diploma in education with necessary teaching experience. The teaching methods of such teachers are inspected three times a year. That would be a way of dealing with this issue. Removal of a teacher from the school will have devastating consequences.On top of having to teach eight classes, the principal of the school is required to prepare children for first communion, confirmation and entrance examinations to secondary schools. She has to take care of sick children and may have to take injured children to hospital. She also has to do administrative work, meet parents, organise school trips, encourage sport and attend to the remedial needs of students in the school. It is impossible to expect any teacher to perform all these tasks. The Department of Education and Science is in such cases paying principals to be glorified babysitters, and that is not acceptable. I am sure I have outlined only some of the principal's functions.Some €175,000 was recently spent on Knocknagrave national school. Other national schools complain that there are too many children in their classrooms and that they have to teach in portakabins. Knocknagrave has a lot going for it. There will not be a single national school between Tyndavnet and Clogher, an area of 14 miles, if the current trend continues. I strongly urge the Minister to take on board my suggestion.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	814	Ba mhaith liom mo leithscéal pearsanta a ghabháil don Teachta nach bhfuil an tAire féin anseo. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as ucht an ócáid a thabhairt dom cur in iúl don Teach mar gheall ar chúrsaí ins an Roinn. Rith sé liom nuair a bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Teachta go bhfuil a fhios agam faoin scoil a raibh sé ag caint fói dtaobh di. Bhí mé féin ag caint leis an phríomhoide agus chuir sé in iúl dom na deacrachtaí, pearsanta agus eile, atá aige.I am aware of the school to which the Deputy refers. I have had occasion to speak with the príomhoide of the school who drew this matter to my attention and, I am sure, to the attention of all elected representatives in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners. The staffing schedule is set out in a circular which issues from the Department of Education and Science to all primary school boards of management. Accordingly, all boards are aware of the staffing position for their school in any school year.The staffing schedule for the coming school year, 2004-05, is outlined in the Department's circular 03/04, which issued to all primary schools in April 2004 and is also available on the Department's website. The allocation of additional teaching posts in recent years for children with special needs and improvements in the staffing schedule together with a decline in enrolments has helped to ensure that the overall pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools has improved substantially.An independent appeals board on mainstream staffing allocations was established in August 2002 and commenced operation at the beginning of the 2002-03 school year. The purpose of the board is to allow for the independent consideration of appeals under certain criteria against the mainstream staffing schedule as issued to schools. The appeals board allows for equitable and transparent treatment of all primary schools and its decision is final. It is not open to the Minister for Education and Science or his Department to interfere in this process. Details of the criteria and application date for appeal were issued to all schools.The staffing schedule is designed to cater for increases and decreases in enrolment. There is no provision for temporary teachers to be allocated in instances where brief drops in pupil enrolment occur. On the basis of the question asked, the reply does not refer to the school mentioned by the Deputy. I appreciate that additional children attended the school after 30 September, but unfortunately the permeation would not be such that it would be part of the emergency schedule. I have listened to what the Deputy had to say and will inform my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, of the difficulties being experienced by the two-teacher school in north Monaghan. Perhaps this matter can be pressed further outside the realms of the floor of the House.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	815	I thank the House for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening. Cornafulla national school currently has 261 pupils and by September 2005 will cater for more than 300 pupils. The school was built in 1983 as a five teacher school. The existing structure can cater for approximately 150 children.In September 2004, the school will have to cater for 270 pupils and 14 teachers. It is the fastest growing school in County Roscommon, if not the fastest growing school in the west. Currently, 103 junior pupils, baby and senior infants, are being catered for in the old school constructed in 1843 and renovated in 2001. The building is serviced by two toilets which cater for the needs of these 103 pupils. The situation is totally unsuitable. The school is Dickensian and brings a new meaning to the book Hard Times.I ask the Minister to address immediately a situation where 103 pupils are provided with two toilets in a totally unsuitable school built in 1843. The old school has a stairway which is completely inadequate compared with today's standards. Not only is the 161 year old school building inadequate to meet today's standards, there is also severe overcrowding in the building constructed in 1983. At present, that building accommodates 158 children which is in excess of its construction specification. The building also accommodates two resource teachers, a learning support teacher and a secretary. The general purpose room has been divided into three and converted into an area for the resource teachers, a classroom and a staff room. It is expected that the numbers attending the school will continue to increase given the huge building developments in the local area.Having seen the facilities and the overcrowding in the school first hand, I believe that the school urgently needs departmental approval for the construction of five additional classrooms, a general purpose room, a staff room and an administration block. As the Minister can see from the list, there is significant under-resourcing of accommodation in the building at present and an urgent need for further resources to be put in place. Unless the funding from the Department is forthcoming, the school will have to turn away pupils. In light of the fact that this year's enrolment is almost exclusively comprised of pupils with older siblings in the school, the Department's inaction could see families being split up owing to the lack of adequate accommodation. The situation is urgent. The school roll has dramatically increased over the last few years. The facilities are inadequate to meet current numbers which will increase over the coming years.I plead with the Minister, because of his own connections with south Roscommon and the strong loyalty of the Cornafulla area to his late father, to take a personal interest in the issue and ensure that the resources are put in place and sanction is provided by the Department of Education and Science to ensure that the construction goes ahead. It is not good enough that 103 junior pupils should be provided with two toilets in a school built 161 years ago. Surely no one thinks that is an acceptable situation and that pupils should be left like that in this day and age. I ask the Minister to ensure that sanction is provided by the Department and that the construction takes place.

I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's proposals for the proposed refurbishment and extension project at Cornafulla national school, County Roscommon.The Department received an application from the board of management of the school in May 2000 requesting the provision of additional accommodation. The Cornafulla national school building project is listed in section 8 of the 2004 school building programme which is published on the Department's website. A full design team has been appointed and architectural design of the project is progressing. The project is currently at stages 1, 2 and 3, detailed plans and costs, and has been assigned a band 2 rating by the Department of Education and Science in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that it is planned to progress the project to advanced architectural planning during this year.Indicative timescales have been included for large-scale projects proceeding to tender in 2004. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme, which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing to tender in this year's programme, including Cornafulla national school. The Department will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.I thank the Deputy once again for raising the matter in the House.

I was prompted to seek a debate largely because I was not satisfied by the response that I had received to a question that I had tabled on the issue. I was contacted by more than one constituent who is or has a child currently studying for the leaving certificate and is keen to study medicine. The Department of Education and Science has said that this may be the last year that someone can gain direct access to study medicine. I understand from the response that the Minister is to receive and decide on the recommendations of the working group on undergraduate medical education and training later in the year.The dilemma in which I find myself is that if someone who is currently sitting the leaving certificate fails to gain enough points to study medicine, the question arises which subject he or she should study to facilitate entry to study medicine in three years. In responding to my question, the Minister stated that the report had recommended that students should undertake an undergraduate programme of their choice in any area before taking a decision to enter medicine or one of the other health sciences. That leaves it wide open and the effect will be that, in three years, when graduates from any field will be seeking entry to medical training, there will be an even greater bottleneck than is currently the case. I understand that the rationale behind the introduction of the graduate level is to ease the current pressure on the points system. However, this will have a completely contrary, or at least prolonging, effect.The first requirement that will present itself when the Minister is dealing with the CAO is addressing the potentially significant number of graduates who may seek entry to study medicine at graduate level. The primary degree will be in health sciences. Some kind of flushing out will have to occur which is in direct conflict with the information the Minister has provided in response to my question. That is the difficulty that my constituents and I have. The Minister must make a firm decision on this before 1 July so that students can make decisions on their CAO form, since that is the date by which final "change of mind" slips must be submitted.That was the issue that prompted my investigation into the matter. However, on looking into it, I discovered that there are a few other reasons to be somewhat concerned. Moving the entry level to graduates simply moves the pressure from second level to third level. The real answer to easing the points pressure is to provide more places for medical training. To that end, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member, is currently conducting research and the report is imminent.Under the new changes proposed, and given that so many people may present themselves at graduate level, a method of filtering or selecting entrants will have to be devised. How will that selection be conducted and will it be fair? Are we sure it will be an improvement on the current CAO system? The proposal would also extend the length of time to qualify for medicine from the current six years to a primary degree of three years followed by a five-year degree. That would obviously increase costs. Students would not qualify for free education for the second degree and it would take many more years of study, meaning that the costs would rise to the disadvantage of people from poorer backgrounds who might be precluded from studying medicine. That is currently the case on cost grounds alone.Furthermore, if these proposals are to be adopted, will the health service be starved of medical graduates as the system establishes itself? The health services can ill-afford such a blip. It is significant that the deans of the five medical schools have said that they are opposed to exclusively graduate-based entry. I am sure that the Minister will take cognisance of that. However, before changing the entry system, we must be sure of what the benefits are and I am not at all convinced that the case for change has been made.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	818	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides the Minister for Education and Science with an opportunity to outline the position to the House.In September 2003, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, together with his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, announced details of the membership and terms of reference for a working group on undergraduate medical education and training which has been jointly established to make recommendations on the organisation and delivery of high quality training for doctors in Ireland. The working group was asked to look at the recommendations of a report prepared by the Higher Education Authority, which was commissioned on foot of a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, to address the issue of the distorting impact of these high points courses on the points system.The report recommended a move away from undergraduate entry to medicine and the other health science disciplines including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, pharmacy and radiography to a system of broad based graduate entry. This is preferred to the introduction of a common sciences programme, which would simply become the new high points course.Such an approach would yield a number of benefits including the elimination of the high points associated with the existing entry to these programmes. It would enable second level students to select undergraduate courses in line with their preferences and aptitudes, enhancing their educational experience at both senior cycle and undergraduate levels. It would also ensure that individuals' decisions to enter these professions are made at a more mature age and for the "right" reasons — not simply because they are high points achievers — thus improving attrition rates in the professions and encouraging more "rounded" entrants with broader skilled backgrounds. However, it is clear that such a change will have an impact, which is the reason the Minister for Education and Science has sought the advice of experts in this area.The terms of reference for the working group include an examination on the organisation and delivery of undergraduate medical education and training in Ireland, with particular reference to the course curriculum and syllabus; teaching methods and delivery mechanisms; making undergraduate medical teaching professional; the scope for the promotion of greater interdisciplinary working between professionals through the development of joint programmes at the initial stages of undergraduate training — signalled in the health strategy, under action 104; and such other issues relating to the organisation and delivery of undergraduate medical education and training as the working group considers relevant. These other issues would include any resource implications, in so far as they arise.The working group's recommendations, in so far as is possible, will be framed within the context of existing resources. Where this is not feasible, the various means other than Exchequer provision by which the resource implications might be funded shall be identified. The Minister for Education and Science expects to receive the recommendations of the working group later this year.He is particularly conscious of the uncertainty for students referred to by the Deputy, in moving the Adjournment this evening, and is anxious that this be resolved as quickly as possible. It is not anticipated that students considering the CAO "Change of Mind" choices before the first day of July will be excluded from future potential entry to medicine on the basis of their choice at this time.I thank the Deputy for raising the matter in this House.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	819	Last December the Minister for Finance announced his decision to move 200 staff to Mitchelstown from the head office of Bus Éireann. That announcement shows the nonsense of the decentralisation process. There are not 200 staff in the head office in Dublin. There are 80.Some 85% of Bus Éireann staff are already relocated outside Dublin. What a nonsensical proposal as regards decentralisation this is since the Government does not seem to know how many staff are working in head office. It had almost three times the number actually there and given that 85% of the staff were already located outside Dublin, there was surely no need for further decentralisation.I see from a newspaper article dated the end of May that the decentralisation group is continuing on the same basis, as though the 200 staff were in Dublin. The phantom staff will be decentralised down the country somewhere. The 80 staff working in Broadstone did a survey on decentralisation. It showed that 96% of them did not want to move to Mitchelstown, which is the proposed location, and 92% did not want to move anywhere, but wanted to stay in Dublin. Furthermore, 85% described the move as a "political stunt". I must say "Amen" to that.I have received a number of letters from constituents on this matter, all of whom are totally opposed to the proposal to move. I will just quote one or two of the good points that have been made:One is that Bus Éireann is "totally unique" in the decentralisation process: "We are a commercial company and our staff are not civil servants." This is an interesting aspect, as the Minister of Finance spoke purely of civil servants in his budget speech. Another says: "No commercial or business case has been made for the relocation of our head office. We were told that this process was voluntary, yet, as we have not been told what our options are if we decide not to relocate, we feel like there is no choice". Finally, Bus Éireann's own implementation plan says: "The most serious risk created by decentralising the head office of Bus Éireann from Dublin to Mitchelstown is the continuity of the business. This risk would be very low if the majority of management and staff volunteered to transfer, but the opposite will be the case." So decentralisation is a threat to the future of the company.These remarks were made by one member who certainly is disgruntled with the proposal. The head office is based in my constituency, so I am well aware of that disgruntlement being multiplied hundreds of times. There is a strong human element to all of this. Families have to be uprooted. In the modern Ireland both spouses are generally working and it is extremely difficult for the other spouse who is not moving to Mitchelstown to uproot from his or her job and not suffer the loss of serious income. There is the search for another job to be considered, promotional prospects, career options etc. As regards other family members, children have to be uprooted and must relocate to other schools where there may or may not be sufficient place in the immediate facility. These are matters of considerable concern, especially in an area where already there has been massive staff decentralisation and where the number employed in head office is low — 80 members. I am asking the Minister of State if the decision might be reviewed in the light of what I have said, with a view to allowing the staff to remain in Dublin and retain that core head office element that is necessary to ensure the continuation of a successful venture.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	820	I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. He wants to make the point that the decision to include the decentralisation of Bus Éireann staff is consistent with the overall approach to decentralisation both in this programme and in previous initiatives. The company has prepared an initial implementation plan as regards the headquarters staff and will be developing this as further information becomes available.The proposal has to be seen in the context of the wider plan to decentralise more than 10,000 civil and public service jobs to locations outside of Dublin. As his colleague the Minister for Finance announced in the budget speech in December last, the decision to undertake this initiative was taken for a variety of reasons, including the Government's desire to spread the fruits of growth on a regionally progressive basis.The transport sector is contributing to this initiative and in total about 460 posts will be moved from Dublin to a number of locations including Loughrea, Shannon and Ballinasloe in addition to Mitchelstown. By their nature many of the transport operations involved extend across the country. Bus Éireann is not an exception in this regard. In the case of the Department of Transport there are already 60 staff based in Ballina, with a further 65 driver testers and supervisors who operate from more than 50 locations throughout the country. The Irish Aviation Authority and the National Roads Authority have a significant presence outside of Dublin and both of these bodies are due to have their headquarters relocated.When the process of decentralisation commenced almost 20 years ago it was to a large extent sections of parts of Departments or agencies that were moved to locations away from Dublin. This most recent decision is to proceed with a new and more radical programme of decentralisation not only in scale but in that both the operational side of Departments and agencies and the decision-making function will also be relocated. To that end, a number of Departments and agencies are being decentralised in their entirety. A small amount of office accommodation and a small secretariat will be retained in Dublin for Ministers. When the programme has been completed, eight Departments and the Office of Public Works will be based outside Dublin. Just seven Departments will have their headquarters in Dublin.As is the case in respect of the transport sector, significant portions of the many Departments and agencies that are due to relocate are decentralised outside Dublin. During the first decentralisation programme 20 years ago, for example, a large portion of the then Department of Agriculture was relocated to Castlebar. A total of 655 jobs in the Department of Agriculture and Food and a number of its agencies will be relocated under the current decentralisation programme to five locations outside Dublin. Some 400 jobs at the departmental headquarters will go to Portlaoise.The Minister believes that the principle of relocating jobs from organisations that have already been decentralised to a significant degree is well established. He does not see any compelling reasons the headquarters of Bus Éireann's operations should not move to Mitchelstown. Such a move would be consistent with the current and past decentralisation programmes. If most of an organisation's operations are outside Dublin, one could ask why its headquarters needs to be in that city.The full details of the process for the transport sector are being developed. That this creates challenges and opportunities for the organisations involved is understandable, given the extent of the initiative. In the case of Bus Éireann, for example, work is continuing on identifying the posts that will be transferred. Over 80 posts have been included on the central applications facility to date. The Minister has asked the chairman of the company to examine how the overall target of 200 can be met. The Minister for Transport is confident that the transport sector, including Bus Éireann, can make a positive contribution to the decentralisation programme which will benefit the country.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The Medical Council investigated the conduct of Dr. Michael Neary and found him guilty of professional misconduct in the case of ten patients. The Government then decided to establish a non-statutory inquiry chaired by Judge Maureen Harding-Clark.A formal announcement of the terms of reference will be made shortly. In broad terms, it will examine the rate of peripartum hysterectomy at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. Particular reference will be made to the period covered in the report of the fitness to practise committee of the Medical Council about Dr. Michael Neary and the period since the publication of its report. It will determine how this rate compared with the rate in other maternity units of similar status. It will also inquire into whether Dr. Neary's practice was commented or acted upon by others at the hospital. It will examine whether internal or external reviews were conducted. It will also inquire into the measures put in place to prevent a repeat of those events at the hospital and offer advice on any additional systems that should be put in place.A number of meetings were held with Patient Focus, the patient support group, and the most recent occurred on 20 May. As part of the process the group was briefed by counsel to the inquiry on how it proposes to conduct its investigations. It was assured that any woman who wishes to give evidence will be facilitated. I am aware that the group has some concerns about the scope of the report to be furnished by the inquiry and on the compellability of witnesses. My Department has raised its concerns with the inquiry and I will revert to the group in due course.If the inquiry finds itself unable to fully discharge its remit due to non-co-operation by relevant persons or bodies then the judge will report it to me. I will then ask the Government to consider what further action may be necessary. It may include recourse to an investigation under the Commissions of Investigation Bill 2003 when enacted.The inquiry team has already examined a substantial amount of documents and records. It was asked to report within nine months.

I am informed by the North Eastern Health Board that the day programme is not closing.The overall objective of the Government's strategy on drug misuse is to significantly reduce the harm caused to individuals and society through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. It wants to provide a range of options to encourage and enable drug misusers to avail of treatment with the aim of reducing dependency and improving overall health and social well-being. This is being achieved by addiction treatment service providers, statutory and non-statutory, working together in partnership.Recently I approved national lottery funding of €50,000 for the Bradan day programme. The NEHB has advised me that it provided funding to Bradan House. The health board gave the day programme €27,000 in 2002 and €35,000 in 2003.Since the middle of last year negotiations took place between the board and the Bradan day programme about developing a service level agreement for referral of drug free clients from the board's addiction service to the day and aftercare programmes. An agreement was reached. As soon as it is signed by Bradan, the health board will fund clients referred by it on a per client basis. This is based on the premise that the services offered by the programme will enhance those of the board's and not replicate what was already being provided. These new arrangements are likely to result in a greater number of clients being referred to the Bradan day programme.

An additional €2 million was allocated in 2003 and brought the ongoing additional development funding to €7 per annum. In 2002 €2 million in capital funding and a further €1 million in respect of information and communications technology supports was also provided.Since the strategy was published I have also provided significant further support for the development of general practice out-of-hours co-operatives. Additional funding of €17.3 million was provided in 2002 and a further €4.14 million in 2003. Therefore, an additional €21.44 million is now included in the base funding. It is in addition to the substantial funding already in the system for the delivery of a wide range of primary and community care services. The strategy identified that a significant component of the development of primary care teams, in the short to medium term, would involve the reorientation of existing staff and resources.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	824	The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella. In accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland it can be administered to children between 12 and 15 months of age. A vaccine uptake rate of 95% is required to protect children from the diseases and to stop them spreading in the community. Measles is a highly infectious and serious disease and approximately one in 15 children that contract measles suffer serious complications.I am concerned about the MMR immunisation rates because of the risk of children contracting potentially serious diseases. The outbreak of measles in 2000 resulted in approximately 2,000 cases and three deaths. It is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake.Data provided by the National Disease Surveillance Centre indicates that MMR uptake rates for children of 24 months of age per health board region for the fourth quarter of 2003 are as follows:%ERHA77MHB89MWHB82NEHB83NWHB86SEHB84SHB80WHB76Ireland80*The most recent period for which uptake figures are available from the NDSC.Based on information available from the NDSC, there was a significant increase in 2003 in the number of reported measles cases. In 2002 as many as 243 cases of measles were reported but provisional returns for 2003 indicate that there were 576 measles cases during that year. It underlines the importance of raising the immunisation uptake level to the optimal level of 95% against measles and the other potentially serious infectious diseases. I am encouraged by the most recent statistics from the NDSC that show that MMR uptake for children up to 24 months of age was 80% for the fourth quart of 2003, an increase on 75% in the comparative quarter in 2002. Data provided by the NDSC indicate that from week one to week 23, inclusive, of 2004, or up to 12 June, as many as 92 cases of measles were notified compared with 460 cases notified for the comparative period in 2003. There appears to be a significant reduction in the number of cases reported so far this year. However, we cannot afford to become complacent particularly as the number of notified cases of rubella has risen from 28 in the period from week one to week 23, inclusive, of 2004 compared with 26 cases notified in the comparative period last year.In 2003 the chief executive officers in all health boards and the ERHA were asked to ensure that specific immunisation measures were prioritised in all regions to prevent a serious measles outbreak. A national immunisation steering committee was established to address a wide range of issues related to childhood and other immunisation programmes, including the identification of issues that are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. In April 2002 I launched its report. A national implementation group was established to draw up a phased plan based on the report's recommendations.Following consideration of proposals for childhood immunisation that were submitted by the implementation group through the Health Boards Executive, on behalf of the health boards, a sum of €2.116 million was allocated by my Department in 2003 to fund initiatives to improve childhood immunisation uptake. A further €2.778 million was allocated for that purpose this year. At present funding in the region of €800,000 is being allocated to health boards via HeBE specifically for regional and localised projects that will focus on measures to improve immunisation uptake.Some parents are concerned about the MMR vaccine. Negative coverage has added to their confusion about whether to vaccinate their children. In April 2002 I launched the MMR vaccine discussion pack. It is an information guide for health professionals and parents. It was produced by the NDSC and the Department of public health and the Southern Health Board. It was published by HeBE on behalf of the health boards. The pack sets out the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore them together, review the evidence and provide a basis for making an informed decision. The information will allow a full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The pack is set out in a question and answer format. It addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR, autism and Crohn's disease, its safety and side effects, the purpose of a second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to it. The pack will enable health professionals to respond to the real concerns of parents.Some health boards have undertaken measures in their regions to improve vaccine uptake. These include the following: information sessions for professionals such as doctors and nurses in the area; information sessions for parents; distribution of information to the public such as providing leaflets on MMR available in public areas; advertisements taken out in local newspapers; advertisements on local radio stations; advice on immunisation, including MMR, forms part of every public health nurse consultation with parents; information leaflets displayed prominently in all health centres; information given to schools regarding the booster MMR; follow-up of parents by letter and telephone where children have not been vaccinated; a follow-up with general practitioners and nurses about children in their area who have not been vaccinated; and information sessions for staff.I urge all parents to immunise their children against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme. I want them to ensure that their children and the population have the maximum protection against such diseases. This is important in light of the increase in reported measles cases during 2003.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	825	The national breast screening programme commenced in March 2000. Phase one covered the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and the North Eastern Health Board regions. Last year I announced the extension of the BreastCheck programme to counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford and the national roll-out to the southern and western counties. Last March screening commenced in Wexford.The BreastCheck clinical unit in the western area will be at the University College Hospital, Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary North Riding. The clinical unit in the southern area will be located at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary South Riding.The national roll-out of BreastCheck requires detailed planning to include essential infrastructure. Two project teams, one in each region, were established to develop briefs for the capital infrastructure needed for the static units in the south and west. The South Infirmary, that deals with the southern region, considered it necessary to commission a site strategy study to ensure the integration of the breast screening service into its present and future development. My Department provided a capital grant of €230,000 for the study to be undertaken by professional architectural, engineering and quantity surveying experts. The study was submitted to my Department at the end of March and a detailed brief is being prepared by BreastCheck and the hospital. As regards the west, BreastCheck submitted a number of options for the construction of a static unit on the grounds of University College Hospital, Galway. My Department is considering both projects in the context of the framework for capital investment 2004-2008 that is being discussed with the Department of Finance.An essential element of the rollout of the programme is investment in education and training of radiographers. BreastCheck employs qualified and experienced radiographers who have specialised postgraduate training and qualifications related to mammography. BreastCheck and the symptomatic breast cancer services combined have a significant ongoing recruitment and training requirement in this area. Last year I announced the development of a training centre for radiographers and mammography at Eccles Street that will become the national training centre in breast imaging. Resources are being made available to BreastCheck to support the initiative that will cost in excess of €750,000. Design specification work was undertaken, the core elements of the training programme are being addressed and the recruitment process for a course leader has been initiated.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	826	Recently the national disease surveillance centre published overall HIV figures for 2003. There were 399 newly diagnosed cases in 2003 which represents a 10% increase on 2002. The total number of cases of HIV infection diagnosed to the end of 2003 is 3,408.In the first six months of 2003 there were 207 newly diagnosed cases of HIV infection. Of the 147 newly diagnosed cases where exposure category is known, there were 87 heterosexuals — 23 of which were male, 64 were female. In relation to other exposure categories, there were 35 men who have sex with men, 14 injecting drug users and seven cases of mother to child transmission. Of the 207 cases diagnosed in the first six months of 2003 as many as 106 or 51.2% were female and 100 or 48.3% were male. The gender in one case was unknown.The report of the national AIDS strategy committee was published in 2000. It made recommendations to deal with HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. At present my Department, through the strategy committee and its sub-committees on education and prevention, surveillance and care and management is working to implement these recommendations.The care and management sub-committee of NASC visited hospitals and health boards involved in the provision of services to people with HIV-AIDS and STIs. The purpose of these visits was to identify gaps and make recommendations for the future direction of treatment services. The report of the sub-committee is being finalised.Education is an important aspect in raising awareness of the dangers in risky sexual behaviour that could result in the transmission of HIV and other STIs. Health boards undertake information and awareness activities at regional level and amongst the issues addressed is the prevention of STIs, including HIV. Where appropriate the health boards work in conjunction with and fund voluntary organisations who work with people living with HIV.My Department's health promotion unit is also involved in and support a range of initiatives aimed at preventing and raising awareness of HIV-AIDS and other STIs. These include a national public awareness advertising campaign to promote sexual health that is aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 age group. The campaign was run for several years in third level colleges, bars, clubs and youth clubs. Recently it was revised by the health promotion unit and now it targets an increased number of venues. In addition, the unit produces a range of awareness raising leaflets on HIV, other STIs and safe sex practices. They are available through the health promotion departments in each health board area. This year a national survey of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviours in Ireland will be funded by my Department and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.Since 1997 almost €5.5 million additional funding was provided to health boards to address the problems of HIV-AIDS and other STIs. It resulted in a substantial increase in facilities. At present there are seven consultants specialising in the treatment of HIV-AIDS and STIs. There are five consultants based in Dublin, one deals with children and another is based in Cork. Recently the Western Health Board appointed a new infectious disease consultant. My Department will continue to monitor the position of HIV-Aids and other STIs.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	827	On 12 February I held an informal dinner for EU health ministers to discuss the matter of avian influenza and mutual co-operation in Europe to combat it. At the meeting the ministers agreed to keep each other informed in advance of taking any further control measures. They also agreed to endeavour to co-ordinate measures to protect public health to the greatest extent possible across the EU. Member states and the Commission agreed to engage with the pharmaceutical industry to consider the preparation of protocols for the manufacture, availability and distribution of vaccines and antivirals as part of pandemic planning preparedness.Each state undertook to review their national pandemic preparedness plans. Health ministers also asked the Commission to bring forward its EU pandemic preparedness plan, as a matter of urgency.On 12 May the matter was discussed at a meeting of EU health ministers. There was consensus on the need for member states and the European Commission to work together for early agreement on the adoption of a co-ordinated approach to the purchase of antivirals and vaccines.On 2 June the health council agreed to extend the health security committee's mandate to cover the area of Community influenza pandemic preparedness and response planning for a temporary transitional period to the end of May 2005. A key task of the health security committee will be to assess the desirability or otherwise of any future collective negotiation process with the pharmaceutical industry for the development and purchase of vaccines and antivirals. Account shall be taken of the cost, storage, logistical and legal aspects of the area while respecting the competence of member states. A report on the issue is scheduled for consideration by the HSC in September.Medical experts consider that it is almost inevitable that another influenza pandemic will occur but it is impossible to predict when. The outbreak of avian influenza in Asia earlier this year highlighted the need for vigilance and preparedness in this regard. Mortality during a pandemic is usually very high and may not be confined to the usual risk groups. An influenza pandemic would have serious effects in terms of mortality and morbidity. Services such as acute hospitals and general practice would experience greatly increased workloads, well in excess of those seen during more regular outbreaks of influenza.I established a committee under the chairmanship of Professor William Hall, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory. In September 2002 it presented an outline plan for influenza pandemic preparedness, entitled A Model Plan for Influenza Pandemic Preparedness, to my Department. A copy of it was forwarded to each health board and authority chief executive officer for circulation to all relevant personnel. In addition, each CEO was requested to establish a regional committee to develop a regional influenza pandemic plan that should include all key stakeholders. These plans will form part of the emergency plan for each region.At present the model plan is being revised by an expert group that I established in late 2003 in light of the recent SARS experience. The outline plan sets out various recommendations and options. Following their detailed consideration the expert group will make specific recommendations on the implementation of various aspects of the plan. It will also give guidance, if required, to the health boards and regional committees to assist in the development of their regional plans. The group is comprised of medical experts as well as representatives of relevant organisations, including the Irish College of General Practitioners, Irish Medicines Board, NVRL, the National Disease Surveillance Centre and health board nominees. Its work was delayed by the ongoing non-participation of consultants in departmental committee meetings.In addition, my Department established a contingency planning steering group last January. It will oversee the development of a generic public health contingency plan for the health system that would be activated in the event of a large-scale emergency resulting from an infectious diseases outbreak or incident such as SARS or an influenza pandemic to mitigate the impact of such an emergency. The plan will facilitate effective responses to international outbreaks and incidents. Work on the plan is progressing well as well as disease-specific operational plans for SARS and an influenza pandemic. I anticipate that the plan will be circulated to health boards shortly. It will enable health boards to develop, update and test their public health emergency plans.The Health Act 1947 and the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 provide the legislative basis for the control of infectious diseases, including influenza, in Ireland. The national disease surveillance centre plays a key role in the prevention and management of infectious diseases here.The Irish approach to an outbreak of an infectious disease is based on sound internationally accepted principles such as preventative measures, early identification of cases, effective clinical care including good hospital infection control, appropriate surveillance and contract tracing and management of contacts. The procedures for dealing with infectious diseases are based on these principles.Many infectious diseases can be prevented by vaccine use. Immunisation against infectious disease has probably saved more lives than any other public health intervention, apart from the provision of clean water. Improvements in living standards have reduced the mortality from infectious diseases, but immunisation has also played a large role in the reduction of disease incidence. It would not have been possible to eradicate smallpox without vaccine. The eradication of polio in the European region is also largely due to immunisation. In recent years improved economic and social conditions, together with public health action, have virtually eliminated the pandemics of communicable diseases.In the past I have, and will continue to do so, established expert committees or groups to advise on the most appropriate action given the particular circumstances of the outbreak concerned. Guidelines and protocols on the management of many different types of outbreaks have been developed based on the principles referred to above. They take into account guidance published by the World Health Organisation, the centres for disease control and prevention in the USA and a number of other reputable international public health bodies. Most outbreaks begin with the establishment of an outbreak control team that manages it and sets up the necessary control measures.Vaccination is the principal measure for preventing influenza and reducing the impact of epidemics. The WHO recommends vaccination for elderly persons and persons of any age who are considered at high risk for influenza-related complications due to underlying health conditions. Vaccination will be the primary public health intervention in the event of an influenza pandemic. Until a specific vaccine against the prevalent strain of the influenza virus is developed, or has a chance to become effective in individuals, it will be necessary to use antiviral medicines to treat individuals who are ill, particularly those who may be more vulnerable to the virus. Essential workers and vulnerable groups must also be protected by such medicines. My Department secured a quantity of antivirals. Discussions are ongoing at national and EU level about the need to stockpile further supplies.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	828	The health service reform programme is based on the Government's decision of June 2003. It was based on the Prospectus audit of structures and functions in the health system and the report of the commission on financial management and controls in the health service. Both reports identified organisational improvements needed to strengthen the capacity of the health system to meet the challenges of implementing the programme of development and reform set out in the health strategy document, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You.Their implementation is under way and will result in a health services executive, a single unitary national structure for health service planning and delivery. The Government intends to assign the functions of health boards and authority to the Health Service Executive with effect from next January. Formal assignation of these functions will require new legislation that is being prepared. The emphasis is being placed on ensuring that there is adequate governance of the new structures in a radically restructured health system. I am developing more detailed proposals on the arrangements for consultation at regional level.The Government also accepted that there is a need to strengthen existing arrangements for consumer panels and regional co-ordinating or advisory committees in representing the voice of service users. These structures incorporate patients, clients and other users or their advocates. They will work to provide a bottom-up approach to understanding the needs of service users at a regional planning level. Existing models are at different stages of development and will continue to be enhanced. Their mechanisms will serve to bring the views of patients and clients to bear in the decision-making process.I expect to see meaningful input in decision-making from medical and other professionals at all levels in the new structures. This will arise particularly in the areas of service planning, education and training and some aspects of the organisation and design of services. The new structures will be based on a competency rather than a representational model.I am satisfied that the new arrangements, combined with the introduction of system-wide best practice governance and accountability systems, will ensure a stronger, more effective health system and an improved health service for patients and clients.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	829	The NSC was established to oversee, monitor and steer the health reform programme. It is chaired by Mr. Kevin Kelly, the executive chairman of the interim health service executive. The committee is composed of key stakeholders from various strands of the reform programme.The four inter-related strands of activity under way are the change management programme being led by the interim HSE that is planning for its move to a unitary system from 2005; the elements of the reform programme under the remit of my Department that includes, inter alia, its restructuring and the establishment of HIQA; the work of the acute hospital review group chaired by David Hanly; and the ongoing management of the health service and preparations by the health board CEOs for the change to a unitary system. The national steering committee met twice to review progress made under the four inter-related streams.The initial phase of the implementation of the reform programme involved a widespread communications and consultation process. It also involved the establishment of 13 action projects to flesh out specific aspects. The action projects concluded, as planned, at the end of December and a composite document outlining the main findings was prepared. I intend to publish it shortly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	830	The provision of orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board is the responsibility of its CEO in the first instance. I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the area and on a national basis.The grade of specialist in orthodontics was created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003 my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for the qualification at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. The trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. There is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.My Department's commitment to training development is manifested in the funding provided to the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. The appointment will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to a specialist qualification in orthodontics. The health board's CEO reported that a professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of the post my Department approved, in principle, a proposal by the school to further improve its training facilities for orthodontics. The project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities. It will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service for the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.In June 2002 my Department provided an additional €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to the health boards and authority to purchase orthodontic treatment. It has enabled the boards to provide additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The SHB was allocated an additional €720,000 from the fund for the treatment of cases in this way.The board's CEO has informed my Department that 30 to 36 months is the average waiting time for orthodontic treatment in County Kerry. It is less than the average waiting time for orthodontic treatment in the entire board reported by him at the end of March. The CEOs of the health boards and authority informed my Department that at the end of the March quarter 2004 as many as 21,033 children had received orthodontic treatment. As many as 3,400 children are receiving treatment from the SHB. In other words, almost one out of every six children being treated by the public orthodontic service is from the SHB area.There are nearly twice as many children receiving orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated. Almost 4,000 extra children have received treatment from the health boards and authority since the end of 2001.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	831	I provided additional annual revenue funding of €93 million and €25 million of capital funding to health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. They were asked to commission 709 extra beds in the acute hospital sector as part of the Government's commitment under the health strategy to provide an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds over the period to 2011. As many as 589 of these beds have been commissioned to date. Funding was also made available to the health boards and authority to commission the balance of the 709 beds.In 2004 I provided a total of €12.6 million to the ERHA and the Southern Health Board to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to more appropriate settings, thereby freeing up acute hospital beds. The funding provides for the subvention of additional beds in the private nursing home sector and the provision of ongoing support in the community.The Government is committed over the lifetime of the health strategy to providing additional beds in public acute hospitals. Its objective is to improve access for public patients to hospital services and reduce waiting times for treatment.

The level of expenditure was increased from €2.5 million in 1996 to €17.3 million in 2003 and represents an increase of nearly €15 million or over 68%. The numbers in receipt of subvention have increased from 461 in 1996 to nearly 1,000 in 2003 and represents an increase of 539 or 117%. Similarly the numbers in receipt of enhanced subvention have increased from 29 in 1996 to over 530 in 2003. In 2004 a further €556,000 was made available to the board for the scheme and the total overall budget rose to €17.959 million.The expenditure has enabled the board to pay average subventions in excess of the maximum amounts laid down in the nursing home subvention regulations 1993. For example, in 2003 the average subvention paid by the board was €297 per week. In addition approximately 58% of those in receipt of subvention in the Southern Health Board area were paid an amount which, when combined with the non-contributory old age pension rate, amounted to practically the full nursing home charge.My Department provided €1.8 million in 2003 and €3.8 million in 2004 for the purchase of 112 beds in private nursing homes as part of a delayed discharges initiative aimed at relieving acute bed pressures in Cork city. As many as 270 patients were discharged from acute hospitals to more appropriate accommodation. In 2004 my Department also provided the board with an additional €125,000 to commence the introduction of a new scheme of personal care packages in line with pilot schemes that have operated in a number of health board areas. The funding is being targeted at maintaining older people in their own homes who would otherwise require residential care.The SHB and I shall continue to monitor the situation to ensure that any difficulties encountered by patients in meeting the costs of nursing home accommodation are minimised.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	833	The Health Service Employers Agency conducts quarterly surveys of nursing vacancies. Its latest survey is for the month ending 31 March. It contains a breakdown by hospital or health board and voluntary agency and I shall forward a copy to the Deputy.All sectors reported that recruitment was well ahead of resignations and retirements. However, employers reported that 705 vacancies existed at 31 March 2004, a decrease from 947 vacancies in March 2003. The combination of utilising agency nurses and overtime adequately compensates for the shortfall.The number of vacancies as at 31 March 2004 represents a substantial decrease from the end of September 2000 when employers reported 1,388 vacancies. The latest figure represents a reduction of 49%.The current vacancy rate of 1.76% has been declining steadily in recent years. It could be considered as the normal frictional rate given that there will always be some level of movement due to resignations, retirements and nurses availing of opportunities to change employment and locations.The Government has been concerned about the recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of nursing staff for some time. A number of substantial measures were introduced in recent years. The number of nursing training places was increased by 70% since 1998 to 1,640 from 2002 onwards. A comprehensive range of financial supports were introduced to support nurses in pursuing part-time degrees and specialist courses, including back to practice courses. Since 1998 nurses have been paid for overtime. Previously they were given time off in lieu. The introduction of payment represents a further significant financial incentive for nurses.In February 2001 I introduced a scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives. Individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent, part-time basis. The figure of 33,765 wholetime equivalent nurses working in the health service translates into 40,119 nurses. Of these 29,629 work full-time and 10,490 job-share or work other atypical patterns. More than one quarter of the nursing workforce avails of family-friendly work patterns.In 1998 there were 26,612 wholetime equivalent nurses employed in the public health system. By the end of December 2003 it was 33,765, an increase of over 7,150 during the period or 26.8%. It is clear that the recruitment and retention measures I introduced have proved effective.The promotional structure in nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, was substantially improved on foot of the recommendations of the commission on nursing and the nurses' pay settlement in 1999. The national council for the professional development of nursing and midwifery was especially active in the area. To date 1,563 clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner posts have been created.Figures from An Bord Altranais for the same period indicate that there is a steady stream of new entrants into the profession. It is over and above those graduating from the Irish system and further increases the potential recruitment pool. Since 1998 there was a total of 19,945 nurses newly registered by the board of which 13,658 were overseas nurses.The continuing attractiveness of nursing as a career for school leavers and mature code applicants is evident by the number of course applicants. For example, there are 8,300 applications for 1,640 places in the autumn 2004 intake. It is encouraging given that there is an ever-increasing array of attractive alternatives provided by our third level education system.In late 2003 my Department approved the roll-out of the health care assistant training programme on a national basis. It fulfils a key recommendation of the nursing commission. The main objective of the programme is to upskill health care assistants so that, working under the supervision of nurses, they are enabled to take on a wider range of duties. They will free up nursing resources and will concentrate on nursing tasks exclusively.Earlier I referred to the HSEA surveys. They also contain data on agency nurses. The average number of agency nurses used per day in 2001, 2002 and 2003 was 434, 401 and 312, respectively. These figures demonstrate a continuous and substantial downward trend in the use of agency nurses.An extensive range of measures have been introduced to improve the number of nursing staff, including a substantial increase in training places, the recruitment of overseas nurses, a more effective utilisation of the professional skills of nurses and midwives and the close monitoring and assessment of the situation. I am confident that they continue to prove effective in addressing the nursing workforce needs of the health services.

If it is not possible to treat patients within a reasonable period, either in public or private hospitals, arrangements can be made to refer the public patients for treatment abroad. Quality, availability and cost factors are taken into account.The majority of procedures funded by the NTPF to date were carried out in private hospitals here. It has not released prices paid for individual procedures for reasons of commercial sensitivity. It assured my Department that the prices negotiated compare favourably with the comparative benchmarks available for the vast majority of procedures.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	835	Statistics on the incidence of new cancers cases are collated by the national cancer registry. The most up-to-date data for the number of new cases of invasive cervical cancer are for the years 1994 to 2000, inclusive, are as follows:Year1994199519961997199819992000174155215173188156193The data do not show a significant statistical increase in the number of invasive cervical cancer.In October 2000 a pilot cervical screening programme commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board region. Screening is offered free of charge to approximately 74,000 women in the 25 to 60 age group at five year intervals.The Health Board Executive commissioned an examination of the feasibility and implications of a national roll-out of a cervical screening programme. It is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications. The examination includes an evaluation of the pilot programme, policy development and the establishment of national governance arrangements. The evaluation is a key element in informing the development of a high quality cervical screening model for Ireland. HeBE has advised that when the evaluation report is completed it will prepare a draft plan for the national roll-out of a programme for consideration by my Department.The number of smear tests carried out nationally has increased by almost 20% in recent years. To meet the increased demand my Department provided an additional cumulative €11 million since 2002 to enhance the laboratory and colposcopy services. The laboratories employed additional personnel, purchased new equipment and introduced new technology thereby increasing the volume of activity. A number of hospitals have also undertaken initiatives such as give smear test analysis contracts to external laboratories. These initiatives have resulted in a reduction in waiting times. For example, the waiting time for routine results at Cork University Hospital was reduced from 129 days at March 2003 to less than 40 days today.

I have since met the Medical Council, the Irish Medicines Board and the Garda Commissioner with a view to exploring any potential sanctions. I intend to meet the relatives shortly to update them on progress made since our initial meeting.

The report's main conclusion is that the fluoridation should continue as a public health measure.The forum also concluded that water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected; and dental fluorosis, a form of discolouration of the tooth enamel, is a well recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.In all the report made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. The expert body recommended by the forum has been established. Its chairperson is Dr. Seamus O'Hickey, former chief dental officer with my Department. His mix of scientific knowledge, awareness of fluoridation issues and experience of administrative issues leave him well placed to chair it. The expert body shall be known as the Irish expert body on fluorides and health and it held its inaugural meeting last April.The terms of reference are to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the forum on fluoridation; to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research, including new emerging issues, on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required; and to report to the Minister on matters of concern at his request or on its own initiative.The expert body has a broad representation, including areas of public health medicine, engineering, management, environmental protection, environmental health, dentistry and health promotion. It will have a strong consumer input in terms of members of the public and representatives of consumer interests, in addition to the necessary scientific, managerial and public health inputs. It will also oversee the implementation of the forum's wide-ranging recommendations and will advise me on all aspects of fluoride in the future.The secretariat of the body is the Irish Dental Health Foundation. It is an independent charitable trust that has been to the fore in securing co-operation between private and public dentistry and the oral health care industry on joint oral health promotion initiatives. The foundation's stature and expertise place it in an excellent position to support the forum's work in its initial stage. The forum's report envisages that the work of the expert body may be subsumed into the health information quality authority in due course.

It was tasked with recommending how child and adolescent psychiatric services should be developed in the short, medium and long-term to meet identified needs. Its first report was published in March 2001. It recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service, including the recruitment of additional consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists.Since 1997 additional funding of almost €19 million was provided to allow for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry, for the enhancement of existing consultant led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. It resulted in a considerable expansion in the number of professionals employed in the mental health sector. For example, since 1997 an extra 19 child and adolescent psychiatrists posts have been funded. There are now 52 child and adolescent psychiatrists in place. These developments have had a positive impact on the waiting times for initial psychiatric assessment.To date the working group has made recommendations on the organisation of services for the treatment and management of attention deficit hyperactive disorder, the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units and the provision of services for 16 to 18 year olds.My Department does not routinely collect information on the number of children on the waiting list for psychiatric assessment and the waiting times for such assessments. In the course of its work on services for 16 to 18 year olds the working group noted a lack of information on referrals and non-attendees at outpatient clinics. Among its recommendations was the establishment of a database on this area. The recommendation will be considered in the context of the Estimates process for 2005 and subsequent years.The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including child and adolescent psychiatry, will be considered in the context of the work of the expert group on mental health policy. I expect the group to submit a report in 2005.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	840	Operational responsibility for health screening for asylum seekers lies with the health boards that have appropriate regional and local management structures to deliver the programme. In 2004 more than €3 million was allocated to health boards to fund the health screening. The funding is provided on an ongoing basis.Routine infectious diseases services are provided in all health board areas. In addition, an infectious disease screening service is provided for new asylum seekers. Shortly after their arrival a voluntary, confidential and free screening is offered to them. Its purpose is to detect and treat certain infectious diseases. This is done in the interests of the asylum seekers, their families and the community in general.Usually the initial screening takes place at reception centres in Dublin where asylum seekers may reside for five days or more. It continues when they are relocated to other health board regions. Those who do not receive screening in Dublin are offered the service following relocation to other regions. When asylum seekers are accommodated outside of the Eastern Regional Health Authority area the relevant health board is advised on whether screening took place so that appropriate steps can be taken to offer the service where necessary.The approach adopted for communicable disease screening for asylum seekers is reviewed on an ongoing basis by a group representative of the directors of public health and my Department. The current guidelines recommend screening for TB and hepatitis B and, where appropriate, for HIV, polio and varicella zoster or chickenpox. The guidelines do not preclude other investigations deemed necessary on clinical or public health grounds.

It was published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People in 1999. This commitment is endorsed in the 2001 health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You.A number of initiatives were taken to improve dementia services. Significant additional funding was made available for the express purpose of providing assistance to carers, including carers of Alzheimer's sufferers. Additional funding was made available to the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland to expand its services, particularly its day care services. A number of new community nursing units of older people had been constructed in recent years. They provide respite and day care for people with dementia. In addition, a number of extended care facilities operated by the health boards have been adapted to provide dedicated units for dementia sufferers as part of their overall accommodation. I will continue to work with health agencies to provide improved facilities for those with dementia.

While it was being considered by my officials the Brennan report, Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service, and the Prospectus report, Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System, were published. Their content and recommendations were relevant to the subject matter of the GMS review. Therefore, my Department requested Deloitte &  Touche to update its draft report and have regard to the latest financial data from the general medical services payments board. I still intend to bring the review to Government. Afterwards its publication and implementation will be discussed.

It was asked to review postmortem policy, practice and procedures in all hospitals in the State since 1970, particularly relating to organ removal, retention and disposal. Following consultations that I had with the chairman in late 2002, it was agreed that the inquiry would give priority to the completion of its work in respect of postmortem issues in paediatric hospitals with a view to furnishing a report by the end of 2003. This would be followed by a second report on postmortem issues in maternity hospitals and a third report on other hospitals.In recent correspondence the inquiry informed me that it has not proved possible to complete the report on paediatric hospitals within the timeframe as matters have taken longer to conclude than previously anticipated.The inquiry advised that, with some exceptions, the information gathering on paediatric hospitals is complete. The analysis of information and establishing which matters remain in dispute has concluded. The inquiry must deal with the resolution of matters in dispute and the conclusion of its report. This involves communication to participants of matters in dispute; written evidence on matters in dispute; such oral hearings as are necessary on matters in dispute; resolution of such matters; and an opportunity for participants to make submissions where the report proposes to make criticisms.The inquiry further advised that it has at all times kept in mind the need to proceed with its work on maternity hospitals as soon as the paediatric hospitals report was completed. It continued to work in this regard to ensure that all documentation will be available to the inquiry when required. Preparation for reports on other hospitals continues but its primary concern at present is the completion of the report on paediatric hospitals.Parents for Justice represents a number of families affected by the retention of organs. Despite the fact that it decided to withdraw from the inquiry process in 2002, my Department continued to assist it in providing support to families. To date €814,011 was granted to PFJ.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	846	Case mix is an internationally accepted management system for the monitoring and evaluation of health services. The health strategy states "...the most developed system for assessing comparative efficiency and for creating incentives for good performance is case mix." At present the programme operates in 34 hospitals nationally.Arising from the national case mix programme my Department reviews performance across the public hospitals generally. It also discusses the results with hospital management to encourage performance and value for money improvements.Case mix is used as part of the budgetary process to base funding on measured costs and activity rather than on less objective systems of resource allocation and to fund hospitals based on their mix of cases. It is also used in a broad way when considering investment options with the acute hospital sector, bed capacity and the national treatment purchase fund.Following a recent review of the case mix system, the national programme will be significantly enhanced and expanded. The review will be applied to all acute hospital encounters and all acute and sub-acute hospitals by the end of the decade. It is intended that at least 50% of acute hospital funding will be based on peer group related case mix performance by 2009. This is a major development in the system. It will greatly enhance resource allocation, evaluation of investment and value for money aspects in the health sector.

My Department is advised that it proposes to carry out three lung transplants this year. It hopes to increase the level of activity to at least 15 transplants per annum as the programme develops. In addition, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, that provides for a minimum of 15 lung transplants to be performed on Irish patients in the 12 month period to 31 March 2005, subject to the availability of suitable organs. The position can be further reviewed in the event of additional donor organs being available.Once the programme is established the marginal cost per transplant patient, assuming fixed payroll costs, will be €115,000. The estimated cost includes the cost of the extensive assessment programme and post-operative treatment for patients who receive a transplant. It is anticipated that more than eight to ten additional heart transplants will result from the expanded organ donor pool.

General health was measured using the criteria developed by the American Society of Anaesthesiologists.The fluoridation forum reported that the results of this part of the survey showed that there was no difference in the general health status of persons residing in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. A similar examination of general health status was undertaken as part of the current national oral health survey.I established the forum to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. Its report was launched on 10 September 2002. Its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome; local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation in this country attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation was endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	849	As I have previously advised the House, the national cancer forum is developing a new national cancer strategy which is expected to be completed later this year. This strategy will build on the progress that has been made during the implementation of the 1996 national cancer strategy and set out the key priority areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years. It will have regard to developments and best practice in other jurisdictions and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally.A significant body of work has been undertaken in the development of the strategy to date. Representatives of the national cancer forum have met with representatives of the ERHA and all health boards. The forum wrote to more than 90 professional bodies, voluntary bodies, and other stakeholders in order to obtain their views on cancer treatment services. Members of the public have been consulted through advertisements placed in the media.As part of the preparation of the new strategy, an evaluation of the extent to which the objectives of the 1996 strategy have been met was carried out by Deloitte &  Touche consultants and published last December. The key goal of the 1996 national cancer strategy was to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under 65 year age group in the ten-year period from 1994. The Deloitte &  Touche evaluation demonstrated that this reduction was achieved in 2001, which was three years ahead of target.Sub-groups of the national cancer forum were established on generic screening, organisation of cancer services, evaluation and outcomes, evidence based medicine, genetics, nursing and patient issues. The work of these subgroups is informing the development of the new strategy.In relation to the implementation of the 1996 national cancer strategy, since 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately €550 million in the development of cancer services. This includes an additional sum of €15 million which was allocated in 2004 for cancer services. This substantial investment has enabled the funding of 92 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology, haematology and radiation oncology. An additional 245 clinical nurse specialists have also been appointed in the cancer services area.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	850	I established the pharmacy review group in November 2001 to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. I am continuing to examine the complex legal and public health issues in the group's recommendations. The report is available on my Department's website, www.doh.ie, along with reports prepared for the group by Indecon International economic consultants.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	851	I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 84 together.The national cancer registry report, Patterns of Care and Survival from Cancer in Ireland 1994-1998 was researched and published at the request of the national cancer forum as part of the development of the new national cancer strategy. The report examined four cancers, breast, colorectal, lung and prostate in respect of patients diagnosed between 1994 and 1998. For two of the four cancers, breast and colorectal, there were significant differentials between the Eastern Regional Health Authority and other areas of the country in cancer survival. The outcome for lung and prostate cancer did not vary significantly.At my request, the chief medical officer of my Department has referred the report to the chief executive officers and directors of public health in each health board-ERHA area to assess the findings contained in the report and the implications for the delivery of current services. I have also asked the national cancer forum, to assess the implications of the study and advise on its findings in the context of the new cancer strategy being developed. The findings contained in the report will provide an essential baseline for further research which is to be conducted by the national cancer registry.The true measure of success of a targeted strategy such as the cancer strategy is a reduction in mortality. The key goal of the 1996 national cancer strategy was to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality in cancer in the under-65 age group in the ten-year period from 1994. An independent evaluation of the 1996 strategy carried out by Deloitte &  Touche management consultants and published late last year shows that this objective was achieved in 2001, three years ahead of target.The report covers the period 1994 to 1998 and since then significant developments in cancer services have taken place. The overall additional cumulative funding in cancer services in this country since 1997 is in excess of €550 million, including an additional €15 million revenue which I allocated this year. An additional 92 consultant posts in key areas of cancer treatment and 245 clinical nurse specialists across all health board areas have been funded. There has also been approximately €95 million in capital funding allocated specifically for the development of cancer related initiatives. These include an investment of €60 million in radiation oncology, and €11.9 million in BreastCheck.The investment and appointments in cancer services have resulted in substantial increases in activity levels across the three modalities of care of radiation oncology, medical oncology and surgical oncology. For example, since 1996 the annual number of discharges of patients receiving chemotherapy has more than doubled, from 22,000 in 1996 to more than 50,000 in 2002. Similarly, for radiotherapy the increase in discharges reported at Cork University Hospital increased from fewer than 7,000 cases in 1996 to nearly 15,000 in 2002. There has been a 36% increase nationally in surgical procedures for breast cancer, with an additional 500 procedures performed in 2002 compared to 1997.Last year I announced the extension of the BreastCheck programme to counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford and also the national roll-out to the southern and western counties. Screening commenced in Wexford in March of this year.The report, The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland, provides the basis of Government policy in relation to the development and organisation of radiation oncology services. This report, which was developed by an expert working group under the chairmanship of Professor Donal Hollywood, has received considerable international endorsement. The first phase of this programme will be the development of a network of large clinical centres in Dublin Cork and Galway which will permit a rapid increase in patient access and also form a backbone for future service expansion. Already, substantial progress is being made in implementing the report's recommendations. In 2004, an additional €3.5 million is being used to develop the services at the supra regional centres at University College Hospital Galway and Cork University Hospital. The immediate developments in the south and west will result in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. This represents an increase of approximately 50% in linear accelerator capacity. I have provided for the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists. Recruitment for these posts is under way. We have ten consultant radiation oncologists nationally. This will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology in the short term.In relation to other areas of cancer services, significant work is also being undertaken. Under the Ireland-Northern Ireland-NCI Cancer Consortium, awards to the value of €3.5 million are enabling Irish hospitals develop their infrastructure to enable them to carry out high quality clinical trials. Irish hospitals will be able to participate in world-class clinical trials involving the latest advances, helping to ensure that these new and effective treatments are available more readily to patients as a result of this funding.The new national cancer strategy will target investment for cancer services over the next number of years and will make recommendations in relation to the development and organisation of services nationally. The strategy will also provide a mechanism for the development, implementation, monitoring and updating of clinical guidelines for the treatment of cancer.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	852	Responsibility for the collection and collation of data on waiting lists and waiting times now rests with the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. The NTPF is working closely with health boards and individual hospitals to obtain information on patients and the specific surgical procedure required in each case. The information collected by the NTPF is collected by hospital and specialty rather than by individual consultant.As the NTPF evolves into its new role of collecting and reporting data on waiting lists and waiting times, I anticipate that in the future the fund will have available to it information on the waiting lists of individual consultants. In that event, I expect that this information would be available to general practitioners to aid their decision in referring patients to consultants. The sharing of waiting list data with GPs is in keeping with the commitment given in the health strategy to make such information available.

The task of the working group was to make recommendations on all aspects of foster care. The issue of relative care was dealt with in detail in the 2001 report of the working group, entitled Foster Care — A Child Centred Partnership. The report sets out a number of basic principles that should guide placements with relatives. These are that the best interests of the child are paramount; that the child should be placed only in an appropriate, safe, healthy and stable environment; that the standard of care must be equivalent to that provided in a traditional foster care arrangement; that relative placements should only be made where a secure attachment exists or has the potential to develop between the child and the relative concerned; that a partnership approach should be used in developing skills and supports for relatives providing foster care; and that placements should not be made as a means to provide income support.The working group considered the possibility that some children are placed in the care of the health boards in order to provide income support for the family in relation to the child. The group was strongly of the view that such a practice would be highly inappropriate. Income support is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and those in need of such support should contact that Department. The working group stated that children should only be brought into the care of the health boards if they meet the criteria regarding the need for care and protection set out in the Child Care Act. In addition, the choice of placement of any child in the care system should be based on the particular child's individual best interests.Under the current legislation, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.In view of the consideration given by the working group on foster care to the issue of relative care, my Department has no current plans to review the Child Care Act 1991 or the Child Care Regulations 1995 in this regard.

The level of medication prescribed, therefore, is a matter of clinical decision for the particular doctor involved.Prescriptions for anti-depressants may be issued by either general practitioners or consultants in a variety of locations, including general practice, community psychiatric facilities or private or public psychiatric hospitals. Figures provided by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board for the year ending 31 December 2003 show that 205,764 medical cardholders were prescribed anti-depressants at a cost of €34,404,555. A total of 1,178 people were prescribed anti-depressants under the long-term illness scheme at a cost of €203,761 while statistics for the drugs payment scheme, DPS, indicate that 92,022 people were prescribed anti-depressants at a cost of €16,197,705. With regard to the drugs payment scheme, my Department does not have access to information where monthly expenditure by an individual in a community pharmacy is less than the monthly DPS threshold of €78. The above figures do not include certain categories of patients resident in the Eastern Regional Health Authority Area for whom separate arrangements are in place. I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority to forward the additional information directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.An expert group on mental health policy was established in August 2003 to prepare a new national policy framework for the mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document, Planning for the Future. The group consists of 18 widely experienced people who are serving in their personal capacity. The membership encompasses a wide range of knowledge and a balance of views on many issues affecting the performance and delivery of care in our mental health services. All areas of mental health policy and service provision will be examined in the course of the group's work.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	855	The advisory group examining the feasibility of introducing a no-fault compensation scheme for brain-damaged infants has met regularly since its establishment in July 2001. The group has conducted an extensive investigation of the clinical and legal issues involved in the handling of those cases. It has also examined existing levels of service provision for those affected by cerebral damage. The group has had a presentation made to it by parents of children affected by cerebral damage on the day-to-day implications of providing care for them at home. It has also examined prevention strategies and the effects of reforms introduced in the United Kingdom on the handling of claims for compensation for injuries resulting from the provision of clinical care. As the group has already indicated its intention of completing its work by the end of this year, I feel that it would not be appropriate to ask it to expedite the process.The Government has already taken measures to ensure that professional indemnity cover for all consultants in the private sector remains affordable. The cover which consultants, with the exception of obstetricians, need to purchase is capped at €1 million in respect of each and every claim against them. In the case of obstetricians the cover which they need to purchase is capped at €500,000 in each and every case with the further protection of an annual and aggregate cap for each doctor of €1.5 million. As a result of these measures Irish consultant obstetricians in private practice pay €100,000 per annum for their cover rather than the true economic rate of €350,000
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	856	On 23 July last, I announced that I had convened a review panel to conduct an independent review of the events surrounding the tragic death of the person concerned. The members of the panel are Mr David Hanly, management consultant; Ms Kay O'Sullivan director of nursing at Cork University Hospital; and Dr Shakeel A. Qureshi, paediatric cardiologist at Guy's and Thomas's Hospital, London.The terms of reference of the panel are to consider the report of the ERHA in relation to the events of 30 June 2003 at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin and to make such further inquiries and conduct such interviews as the panel considers necessary; to address the questions raised by the family; to examine protocols and procedures relevant to this incident having regard to prevailing standards of best practice, and to examine their application in this case; and to report to the Minister and to make such recommendations as it sees fit. Following the review, both reports will be made available.The work of the review panel is ongoing and I am not in a position at this stage to comment on its work or to say when the report will become available.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	857	Recent statistics published by the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, show that, in 2002, 10,471 cases of sexually transmitted infections were notified to the NDSC. This compares with 9,703 cases notified in 2001 and represents an increase of 7.9%. Statistics in relation to hepatitis B infection show that 57 cases were notified to the NDSC in 2002, compared with 39 notified cases in 2001. Clearly these increases are a cause for concern.Much of the increase in STIs during 2002 is likely to be associated with an increase in unsafe sexual behaviour. However, the NDSC reports anecdotal evidence that improved acceptability of STI clinic services, greater public and professional awareness of STIs and improvements in diagnostic tests have also contributed to the increases in identification and reporting of STIs. The NDSC also report that the increase in infectious hepatitis B notification since 1999 may reflect the introduction of screening programmes. Asylum seekers currently undergo health screening, including testing for hepatitis B infection. The high proportion of female cases notified may also be a result of antenatal screening of pregnant women in maternity hospitals.The report of the national AIDS strategy committee, NASC, which was published in 2000, makes a range of recommendations for dealing with HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. My Department through the national AIDS strategy committee and its sub-committees on education and prevention, surveillance and care and management is currently working to implement these recommendations.The care and management sub-committee of NASC visited the hospitals and health boards involved in the provision of services to people with HIV-AIDS and STIs. The purpose of these visits was to identify gaps and make recommendations for the future direction of treatment services. The report of the sub-committee is currently being finalised.Education is an important aspect in raising awareness of the dangers of engaging in risky sexual behaviour which could result in transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Health boards undertake information and awareness activities at regional level and amongst the issues addressed is the prevention of sexually-transmitted infection. Where appropriate, the health boards work in conjunction with and fund voluntary organisations in this regard.The health promotion unit of my Department is involved in and supports a range of initiatives aimed at preventing and raising awareness of HIV-AIDS and other STIs. These initiatives include national public awareness advertising campaigns aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 age group. The campaign which has been running for several years in third level colleges, bars, clubs and youth clubs has recently been revised by the health promotion unit and now targets an increased number of venues. The health promotion unit also produces a range of awareness raising leaflets on STIs and safe sex practices. These are available through the health promotion departments in each health board area. A national survey of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviours in Ireland funded by my Department and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency will commence in 2004.Almost €5.5 million additional funding has been provided to health boards since 1997 to address the problems of HIV-AIDS and other STIs. This has resulted in a substantial increase in the facilities in place. At present there are seven consultants specialising in the treatment of HIV-AIDS and STIs — five of these are in Dublin, one of whom deals with children, and one in Cork. The Western Health Board has recently appointed a new infectious diseases consultant. My Department will continue to closely monitor the position in relation to HIV-AIDS and other STIs.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	858	Various funding issues, including the commissioning of new units, featured in the discussions during the 2004 Estimates campaign and have also arisen in the normal contacts between officials of my Department and the Department of Finance.A proposal for the opening of new units that are completed or nearing completion, but not yet commissioned were recently developed by my Department. Discussions are taking place between the two Departments in relation to the revenue costs of the proposal and the impact of the proposal on staffing levels. The proposal estimated that the revenue cost of opening these new units was in the region of €35 million in 2004, with additional costs of €48 million in 2005 and €16 million in 2006 to enable the units to be funded on a full-year basis. The estimated capital cost required to bring these projects to commissioning stage is approximately €25 million. The capital cost to date on these facilities has been approximately €440 million. Some of these units are already partially in use as they are replacing old and outdated facilities.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	859	My Department acknowledges the crucial role which general practice plays in the delivery of primary care services. This is recognised in the primary care strategy which envisages a multidisciplinary team model, with the GP as a key member. The primary care task force is examining the provision of primary care across the country.The Hanly report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the future provision of primary care. The report recommended that we put in place a consultant-provided service, provide a wider range of appropriate services and procedures in local hospitals and further resource and strengthen primary care. This will mean a better service for patients. The report emphasises that the planning and provision of acute hospital care cannot take place in isolation from primary care. The report notes that primary care has the potential to meet 90% to 95% of all health care needs provided it is properly structured and resourced. In this context, the report provided for a 50% increase in GP numbers in its medical staffing projections.At the core of the Hanly report is the decentralisation of a large proportion of elective care and other services to smaller hospitals like Nenagh, Ennis and St. Columcille's. Properly resourced local hospitals can do much more working in partnership with GPs and other communication and primary care services. The implications of the Hanly report recommendations for the provision of out-of-hours services for general practitioner co-operatives will be examined in this context.The funding provided for out-of-hours co-operatives between 2000 and 2003 totalled €46.5 million including an additional amount of €4.143 million in 2003 for further expansions. The total funding available in 2004 amounts to €24.048 million. These funds have been included into health boards' base allocation for the continued provision of services under this heading. This dedicated funding is exclusive of the fees paid to participating general practitioners. At present there are out of hours co-operatives in all health board areas.

Responsibility for the recruitment of a chief executive officer is a matter for the board of the interim Health Service Executive and a comprehensive recruitment campaign is under way.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	861	I wish to advise the Deputy that I am not aware of any research indicating that Irish people are sleeping less and therefore I am not in a position to comment on the matter further. However, the National Health Promotion Strategy 2000 — 2005 identifies strategic aims and objectives that contribute to the overall health improvement of the Irish population.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	862	I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 88, 194 and 195 together.The European working time directive, EWTD, requires a reduction in the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, to 58 hours by 1 August, 2004 and ultimately to 48 hours by 2009. The national task force on medical staffing which produced the Hanly report has reiterated the measures that must be progressed to reduce NCHD hours, while providing safe, high quality acute hospital services, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Responsibility for human resource planning rests with the chief executive officer of each health board. Each CEO in managing the workforce in his or her region is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling.As far as medical personnel are concerned, the Hanly report details the number of consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors that will be required in the coming years to provide a high quality, consultant-provided service. An implementation phase will obviously be required to achieve this reconfiguration. The ability to deliver effective training to our doctors while maintaining a demanding medical service in a new model is significant in its own right. I am convinced, however, that this also presents a unique opportunity to improve training, services and the working lifestyles of all NCHDs.The Deputies will be aware that the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospitals doctors identified a range of activities which could be delivered by other health professionals within a within a multidisciplinary team. It suggested a reconfiguration of service and enhanced skills mix which could improve the quality of service to patients and remove inappropriate duties from NCHDs. This would also enhance the skills and broaden the range of capabilities of other health professionals. Work has been ongoing in implementing these recommendations. One example of this is the imminent introduction of a new training programme for phlebotomists which is expected to come into operation later this year. It is clear, however, that more work must be done and that full co-operation from all stakeholders is now required to establish groups at local level, incorporating the appropriate mix of doctors, nurses, local management and other grades to progress these discussions on skill mix issues.A national co-ordinator and support team have been seconded to oversee the implementation of the European working time directive in the health agencies. In addition, medical manpower managers, appointed as part of the NCHD 2000 agreement, are helping to oversee the reduction in NCHD working hours on the ground. They are playing an essential role in the phased implementation of these aspects of the Hanly report, and helping to ensure compliance with the requirements of the directive. Latest returns indicate that in excess of 60% of NCHDs will be compliant with the 58 hours requirement of the directive by 1 August 2004. Difficulties will arise, however, in ensuring full compliance with the specific provisions of the directive, especially those relating to rest breaks and compensatory rest. These issues are being actively reviewed and progressed on an ongoing basis in so far as is possible without having the substantive engagement or necessary agreement of the Irish Medical Organisation.As the Deputies are aware, time is of the essence in this process. Management representatives have been ready and willing to participate in local working groups, representatives of key stakeholders, to implement these measures. These groups would also monitor progress in relation to the reduction in NCHD hours. One of the problems facing management in implementing the directive's requirements is the lack of substantive engagement by the Irish Medical Organisation, the Irish Hospital Consultants' Organisation and some of the medical training colleges. The refusal of the IMO to establish or participate in local implementation groups, the failure to reach any agreement on the industrial relations issues and the limited and individualised response from some of the colleges on the training-rostering issues are causing significant and ongoing difficulties in relation to implementation. The difficulties being faced in this regard have already been outlined to the European Commission in the Department's response to its consultation document on the review of the European working time directive.Management has also been pressing to establish a national implementation group to co-ordinate the work being undertaken at local level, to provide guidance and to monitor progress. These groups at both national and local level should include appropriate hospital managers, consultants, NCHDs and other relevant healthcare professionals. The need to establish these groups has been discussed with the Irish Medical Organisation at the ongoing meetings in the Labour Relations Commission. Full co-operation from all the relevant stakeholders is vital in establishing these groups, to implement these measures that the medical organisations have been lobbying for many years to achieve.I am aware that resource requirements may arise in the context of the work to be undertaken by both the local and national groups when agreement to their establishment is finally obtained. Such requirements will be considered in the context of the overall agreement that must be reached in relation to the implementation of the directive.Responsibility for service provision within each health board-region is a matter for each chief executive officer concerned. This includes the preparation of contingency arrangements to address any situation which might affect the provision of services.The deadlines imposed by the European working time directive will be difficult to meet, assuming the full co-operation of the key stakeholders concerned. I again call on the stakeholders concerned to participate with and co-operate with the necessary implementation processes. I think it is important to state that we face the same hurdles as many of our EU colleagues. They too are grappling with how to provide top quality health services while complying with the requirements of the directive. Every effort has been made and continues to be made to achieve compliance. The current difficulties in no way alleviate our legal obligations and only serve to emphasise the growing urgency of making the necessary progress to achieve implementation. I again call on all interested parties to play their part in achieving a healthier and safer working environment for doctors in training and equally important, the safer provision of services to patients.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	863	I understand that the Federation of Irish Nursing Homes represents private nursing homes in the eastern part of the country in the area for which the Eastern Regional Health Authority has responsibility.In accordance with Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, three rates of subvention are payable. They are €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 per week in respect of the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. The subvention rates were increased by 25% with effect from April 2001.Under the terms of section 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, a health board may, at its discretion, pay more than the maximum rate of subvention in particular circumstances such as, for example, where an individual's personal funds are exhausted or where an individual is unable to meet the gap between the nursing home charge and the amount which he/she can contribute. The application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention within the board's revenue allocation as notified in the letter of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No 3) Act, 1996.In the case of the Eastern Regional Health Authority administrative area there were on average 2,642 people in receipt of subvention in 2003. On average 1,359 persons in receipt of subvention were fully subvented, in other words, the full cost of their accommodation was paid with, in some cases, a contribution from them. A further 699 or 26% were in receipt of enhanced subvention at a rate above the maximum rate approved for their level of dependency. In 2003 the total spent on the nursing home subvention scheme in the Eastern Regional Health Authority amounted to approximately €63 million with the demand for subvention continuing to grow.It is open to any individual who finds himself/herself unable to afford the cost of nursing home care to make an application to his/her local health board for a subvention towards the cost.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	864	I have recently allocated additional annual funding of €500,000 to the Southern Health Board towards implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy. This additional funding will allow the board to begin the planning process for the appointment of a consultant cardiologist to Tralee General Hospital, develop its cardiac rehabilitation services and expand its first responder project.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	865	I am aware of the report by the Public Health Alliance to which the Deputy refers and the material contained therein in relation to health inequalities.The Deputy will be aware that both the National Health Strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, and various reports of the chief medical officer, in particular the annual report of the chief medical officer 1999 and Better Health For Everyone: A Population Health Approach for Ireland, the annual report of the Chief Medical Officer, 2001, have pointed out the links between poverty and ill health in an Irish context.The national anti-poverty strategy is the main vehicle through which the Government's response to the problems of poverty and social exclusion is being channelled. The targets to reduce health inequalities set in the Government's review of the NAPS have been integrated into the national health strategy. These targets were developed in the course of an extensive consultation process with poor and excluded groups. Key health targets are to reduce the gap in premature mortality and low birth weight between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by 10% by 2007, and to reduce differences in life expectancy between Travellers and the rest of the population.Because of the wide range of factors which affect health status and health inequalities, both the National Health Strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You and the report of the working group on NAPS and health envisage these targets being met through a range of actions including greater focus on multi-sectoral work and health impact assessment. A health element has been included in Ireland's National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2003-2005 published in August 2003 — an EU requirement in relation to progressing the Lisbon agenda.The report of the chief medical officer Better Health for Everyone sets out how a population health approach led by a population health division in the Department of Health and Children would enable the multi-sectoral nature of the determinants of health and health inequalities to be more effectively addressed. This issue is being considered in the context of the reorganisation of the Department.The national health strategy asserts quite clearly that to achieve better health for everyone and to reduce health inequalities, health must be put at the centre of public policy. In this context health impact assessment, HIA, is being developed so that relevant policies, strategies and legislation undergo a comprehensive process of health proofing so that their impact on the physical, mental and social well-being of the population is positive. The Institute of Public Health is already involved in some initiatives in this area and the Department of Health and Children in partnership with the Institute is developing a programme in this area which will include: policy seminars for senior management; training courses for HIA practitioners (project management, hazard identification, risk management, health gain interventions, HIA appraisal, inter-sectoral action); and review of HIA tools. An introductory policy seminar for senior managers has been held and HIA methodology guidelines and a screening tool for HIA have been published.The important role of primary care in effectively addressing health inequalities was highlighted in the consultation process for the national anti-poverty strategy. The national health strategy acknowledges the central role of primary care in the future development of the health services. The implementation of the primary care strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, is introducing a new model of primary care involving a core multidisciplinary primary care team, which will work with a wider network of health and personal social care professionals and will offer 24 hour cover. There has been substantial progress in the development of the ten initial primary care teams — one in each health board area — which were approved in late 2002, and additional personnel were funded. Once-off capital funding of €2 million and a further €1 million in respect of information and communications technology supports for the teams was also provided in 2002. Already, some of the teams are providing new or enhanced primary care services, for example, physiotherapy, social work services, shared care, to their target populations. Various teamworking initiatives are receiving high-level support and investment, as are needs assessment developments and research relating to primary care. The establishment of 24 hour GP co-operatives as part of the strengthening of primary care will help to reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise have to attend at an accident and emergency department.One of the key objectives of the health service reform programme is to put in place organisational structures that will facilitate roll-out of the primary care strategy, building on the work already undertaken by the health boards in that regard. The development of future primary care teams will be informed by a needs assessment process at regional and local level. The primary care strategy sets out a vision for the development of primary care, building on the existing strengths of the system to develop an integrated, high-quality, multidisciplinary and user-friendly primary care service to meet people's health and social care needs.Community participation is being progressed in the context of the primary care strategy, the Combat Poverty Agency building healthy communities programme, in which my Department participates, and implementation of HeBE's community participation guidelines.The national health promotion strategy 2000 — 2005 is also central to reducing health inequalities, as are the cardiovascular strategy, the new cancer strategy currently being developed and the mental health policy also in development. Many other actions to reduce health inequalities are also under way.Intensive community based services which have been put in place to provide support for children who may have emotional and behavioural problems include the springboard initiative and the youth advocacy pilot projects. There are now 22 Government funded springboard family support projects countrywide. Some 700 children and 400 parents benefit from these services.My Department has made available €1.5 million to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs this year to match RAPID money being provided for play facilities following on from the publication of the national play policy for children Ready Steady Play.The consultation process for the all-Ireland study on Traveller health status and health needs has been concluded. A proposal from the Institute of Public Health in relation to the design, management and funding of the study is currently under consideration in my Department. It is expected that the study will commence later this year. A pilot study on the inclusion of an ethnic identifier in a number of data sources is also being supported. These initiatives are taking place in the wider context of the ongoing implementation of the national strategy for Traveller health.My Department has commissioned the Institute of Public Health to undertake a programme of work involving the health boards, the Health Board Executive, the Office for Health Management and the Combat Poverty Agency to support health boards to implement actions to achieve the NAPS targets to reduce at health inequalities. The first phase of the work which relates to information gathering and agenda setting is well under way.The Institute of Public Health is progressing work on data and monitoring requirements for NAPS health targets and is also finalising an extensive literature review to identify effective interventions to address the higher rates of low birth weight found in more disadvantaged groups. The NAPS and health working group, including the social partners, has been reconvened in a consultative capacity to inform implementation and monitoring of the NAPS and health targets and to situate the work in the broader NAPS context.My Department is working jointly with the office for social inclusion in the Department of Social and Family Affairs to develop guidelines for poverty proofing tailored to the health services.Performance indicators for a number of groups at risk of social exclusion have been included in the national suite of performance indicators developed jointly by the Department of Health and Children and the health boards and currently in use in the context of the annual service plans. The groups included are Travellers, refugees and asylum seekers, homeless and those with an addiction.The Public Health Alliance report raises the issue of capacity in the health system. The health strategy sets out a programme of investment and reform that will stretch over the next decade. It provides for the largest bed capacity expansion in the history of the health service. €118 million was provided, capital and revenue, to meet the first phase of a programme to provide a total of 3,000 new acute beds over the period to 2011. The Department has been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards that, to date, 584 additional beds have been commissioned. Funding has been made available to health boards/authority to commission the balance of the 709 beds this year.In relation to waiting lists in public acute hospitals, the target set out in the national health strategy states that by the end of 2004 all public patients requiring admission to hospital will be scheduled to commence treatment within a maximum of three months of referral from an out-patient department. Intermediate targets have been set to achieve this aim to ensure that the focus is being turned towards those patients waiting longest for treatment.As the Deputy will be aware I have transferred responsibility for the recording and publishing of waiting list figures to the national treatment purchase fund. The NTPF has a multi-disciplinary team who have been working with individual hospitals to identify patients on waiting lists. The NTPF has been successful in locating additional capacity and arranging treatments for approximately 13,000 patients by the end of May this year. The NTPF has reported that waiting times have fallen significantly with 37% of patients now waiting between three and six months and 43% waiting between six and 12 months for surgery. Therefore, 80% of patients now wait less than one year for surgical treatment. This represents a major reduction in the length of time patients have to wait. The NTPF has the available capacity to treat patients and will continue to focus on reducing waiting times even further. The fund's target is to treat over 12,000 patients in 2004 and has the capacity to treat a minimum of 1,000 patients per month in Ireland and in the United Kingdom. If referrals can be maintained at this level the NTPF expects that waiting times for surgical operations should be reduced further and be brought in line with the health strategy targets of three to six months. It is now the case that, in most instances, adults waiting more than six months for an operation and children waiting more than three months will be facilitated by the fund.In 2004 some €31 million was allocated to the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority as base funding to fund consultant and other support staff costs associated with reducing elective waiting lists. Funding for the national treatment purchase fund was also increased to €44 million in 2004. Therefore the total amount of dedicated funding available to tackle waiting lists in 2004 is €75 million.In relation to the recommendation in the Public Health Alliance report advocating for publicly salaried hospital consultants who work exclusively for public hospitals, as the Deputy will be aware consultants currently holding the category 1 contract are contracted to devote substantially the whole of their professional time, including time spent on private practice, to public hospitals. There are approximately 1,200 approved category 1 consultant posts at present. The Deputy may also be aware that the Report of the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service, the Brennan report, recommended the recruitment of consultants on a public only contract. This recommendation, and other recommendations relevant to the consultant contract arising from the Brennan report, the report on the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System, Prospectus report, and the Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing, Hanly report, will be progressed in the context of the negotiations on a new consultant contract. I am anxious to get these negotiations underway as soon as possible.I might add that, as set out in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance, it remains Government policy to move, on a phased basis, to full economic pricing for private beds in public hospitals.The Public Health Alliance report raises issues about eligibility for health services. The Government is fully committed to the extension of medical card coverage as set out in the health strategy. This will focus on people on low incomes and will give priority to families with children, particularly those with a disability. The timing of the introduction of the extension will be decided having regard to the prevailing budgetary position.The reduction of health inequalities is a central objective of the national health strategy and of the Government's wider national anti-poverty strategy. My priority now is implementation of actions in the context of the these strategies and other related health strategies for particular groups and of the Government's health reform programme generally.

The locations are as follows: Clonskeagh Hospital, Newcastle Hospital and Tivoli Road, Dún Laoghaire in the East Coast Area Health Board; St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny, St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park and Swords in the Northern Area Health Board; and St. Brigid's Hospital, Crooksling, Brú Chaoimhin, Cork Street and Cherry Orchard in the South Western Area Health Board.The Southern Health Board proposes to develop eight 50 bed CNUs in the following locations: St. Finbarr's, Farranlea Road and Ballincollig in the Cork South Lee area: St. Stephen's Hospital Glanmire and St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranbraher in the Cork North Lee area; Mount Alvernia Hospital, Mallow in the North Cork Area; Bantry in the west Cork area and Tralee in Kerry.These additional beds are currently not available, as the process of providing services under a PPP arrangement requires the health board/authority to comply with the EU procurement legislation and national guidelines on PPPs.Public sector benchmarks for both projects have been prepared and finalised by the ERHA and the SHB. These are a comprehensive and detailed risk adjusted costing of the project elements using conventional procurement over the whole life of the project. The public sector benchmarks have been submitted to the Department of Finance for consideration and my Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Finance in relation to the projects. On approval contract notices will be advertised by each of the awarding authorities in the Official Journal of the European Union.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	867	There are some 1.2 million attendances at emergency departments each year. While individual hospitals have systems and procedures in place to record attendance at the emergency department information in relation to the extent or severity of injuries or conditions of people attending is not routinely collected on a national basis by my Department. However, information supplied to my Department by health boards and hospitals indicates that approximately 25% of those who attend the emergency department require admission to hospital.While many of the balance require hospital treatment, it is recognised, that a number of those who attend emergency departments may more appropriately be treated in a primary care setting.The strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction recognises that the Irish health system places considerable reliance on hospital care and that an appropriately developed primary care system can meet between 90% and 95% of all health and personal social service needs. This strategy sets out a new direction for primary care as the central focus for the delivery of health and personal social services. It promotes a team-based approach to service provision which will help to provide a fully integrated primary care service. A properly integrated primary care service can lead to better outcomes, better health status and better cost effectiveness. Appropriately developed, primary care services can help prevent or reduce the impact of conditions that might later require hospitalisation, and can also facilitate earlier hospital discharge. Overall a strengthened primary care system can have a significant impact in alleviating demands on specialist services and the hospital system, particularly accident and emergency and out-patient services. General practitioner out-of-hours co-operatives have been established and are operating in at least part of all health board areas, with one health board, the North Eastern Health Board, having a region wide project. Between 2000 and 2003, €46.5 million has been allocated to the health boards for the purpose of out-of-hours co-operatives and this figure does not include the fees paid to participating general practitioners. An amount of €24 million has been allocated for 2004. The satisfaction rate with the GP co-op service is very high from both patient and provider perspectives. In fact a recent survey by the Western Health Board's service, WestDoc, indicated that of the persons surveyed 30% said that they would have gone to the emergency medicine department if the service had not been available.In order to address the needs of patients presenting at the emergency department some hospitals have established minor injury or illness units. These units provide rapid assessment and appropriate treatment of minor injuries by nurse practitioners or junior doctors. The main advantages of having a separate minor injuries area within the emergency department include the better streamlining of patients and decreased waiting times.

#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	869	My Department had identified the need and requirement for new service developments in rehabilitation medicine in the context of Estimates discussions with the Department of Finance. However, the economic position in 2003 and 2004 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and this was reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for those years. The funding allocated to the health services has been applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes.My Department is aware of the need for a strategic approach to the enhancement of rehabilitation services, encompassing as it does services provided through the entire range of medical disciplines, including paediatrics, orthopaedics, respiratory medicine, cardiology and rheumatology, services for older people and mental health. Rehabilitation can be hospital based or community based and specialist or generalist led. It must be integrated and part of a comprehensive programme which identifies rehabilitation in all its forms as a priority.The key challenge is to develop an integrated approach to driving and resourcing developments in all of these areas. This integrated approach would necessarily involve the recruitment of additional consultants in rehabilitation medicine, as identified by the Deputy, but could not be done in isolation.Inevitably additional resources are already in great demand for these discrete services even before shared objectives are considered. My Department will continue to pursue the matter having regard to available resources.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	870	I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 83 together.My Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Belfast, commissioned a feasibility study and report on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical services, HEMS, for the island of Ireland.The decision to commission the study followed a recommendation by a cross-Border working group on pre-hospital emergency care, one of a number of groups established under the North-South Ministerial Council to examine areas of North-South co-operation in the health field.The report of the consultants appointed to undertake the study was published on 30 April 2004 and is available on my Department's website. The study identifies possible roles for a helicopter emergency medical service, HEMS: primary response — travelling directly to the scene of an incident to take the patient to hospital; and inter-hospital response — the planned, rapid transfer between hospital of patients requiring specialist care, escorted by skilled professionals.The study concludes that an inter-hospital transfer service would be the most appropriate in an all-island context. The study indicates that this would involve significant capital investment and annual operating costs. The estimated cost is €12 million capital and €4 million annual operating costs for a single helicopter. Additional helicopters could be added with an additional annual cost for each aircraft of over €3 million.An air ambulance service is currently provided to the health boards by the Air Corps on a request and availability basis. The Air Corps provides this service subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments. Air Corps helicopters operate from airports and, where available and deemed safe, hospital helipads. Most transfers are airport to airport with onward transfer by land ambulance. The service is well regarded and appreciated by those in the health service who avail of it.My Department is exploring options in relation to HEMS development in the light of the recent study. As part of this exercise, it has initiated discussions with the Department of Defence and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Irish Coast Guard.

To this end, I have established a small working group to evaluate all aspects of drugs prescribing under the various schemes, to determine the feasibility of recommendations in the reports and to make detailed proposals in relation to a number of specific issues.Among the policy options being considered are increased use of generic medicines, pricing and reimbursement structures for the community drug schemes and pharmaeconomic assessment of reimbursable medicines.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	872	My Department is working to progress the establishment of the health information and quality authority, HIQA. A project manager has been appointed and it is anticipated that the board of the interim HIQA will be in place by early autumn. The board will be charged with developing a set-up plan for the HIQA, for my approval and with overseeing implementation of that plan.A key policy aim of the health strategy is to deliver high quality services that are based on evidence-supported best practice. The health information and quality authority is being established to advance this aim. Its responsibilities will be built around three related functions: developing health information; promoting and implementing quality assurance programmes nationally; and overseeing health technology assessment. The structure of the organisation will reflect these functions. The HIQA will subsume relevant functions currently carried out by the national cancer registry, national disease surveillance centre and the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board. The proposed structure of HIQA will form part of the set-up plan.Initially, the agency will be set up on an administrative basis. The new health Bill currently being drafted to underpin the health service reform programme will provide, inter alia, for the establishment of HIQA on a statutory basis.

The issue of tax incentives is a matter for the Department of Finance.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	874	The policies of my Department in relation to recruitment of overseas nurses are set out in the publication, Guidance for Best Practice on the Recruitment of Overseas Nurses and Midwives published in 2001. The guidelines cover all aspects of the recruitment process including: planning staff selection; visas and work permits; provision of advice before leaving home; the procedures for gaining registration in Ireland and induction, orientation and adaptation on arrival in Ireland.The guidelines were developed by a committee of experts from Government Departments and the health services employers, and represent current best practice. The guiding principles underlying the policies are quality, ethical recruitment, equity, inclusiveness and promotion of nursing as a career. This document is currently being updated.Supports provided to overseas nurses arriving to work in the health service include supervised clinical practice, orientation and assessment. A full-time clinical placement co-ordinator is employed to facilitate this. Nurses are paid at the minimum point of the staff nurse scale during this period, and following registration are given full incremental credit for relevant nursing experience. Overseas nurses enjoy the same employment protection as Irish and EU nurses, and are given the same career development supports and opportunities.Employers are required to assist overseas nurses in obtaining registration with An Bord Altranais, and assistance in obtaining work permits, visas and work authorisations can also be provided. Employers should provide subsidised accommodation for six weeks following arrival and assist nurses in securing long-term private accommodation.Since 1998, 5,678 non-EU nurses have been registered by An Bord Altranais. While these nurses come from a variety of countries, the predominant country of origin is the Philippines. Officials from my Department are in regular contact with the Philippines Embassy in London and with the honorary consul in Dublin. In fact, senior officials of my Department met with the Philippines ambassador as recently as 1 June last. Feedback from the Philippines authorities is that their nurses are treated well in Ireland, that Irish employment laws are worker friendly and adequately protect the rights of overseas nurses, and that Irish people are receptive and friendly to immigrant workers. The deputy head of mission at the embassy has stated that Ireland remains competitive for foreign skilled workers, particularly Filipinos.As the Deputy may be aware, late last year media reports highlighted the dissatisfaction of many of the 3,000 or so Filipino nurses working in Ireland with the then arrangement which did not allow their spouses an automatic entitlement to work in Ireland. I also received individual representations from Filipino nurses and the embassy of the Philippines in London on this matter. Many Filipino nurses maintained that the situation in relation to work permits for their spouses effectively meant that the nurse was providing the sole income of the household. Other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia allowed the nurses' spouses an automatic right to work. Nurses cited this as a reason why some of them were transferring to work in other developed countries.I very much welcomed the announcement in February 2004 by my colleague, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, of the introduction of new arrangements for work permits which will be confined to the spouses of certain categories of non-EEA employees, including nurses, in the State. These new arrangements will give greater ease of access to employment for eligible spouses, under specified schemes and facilities. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently published a guide to work permits for spouses of employment permit holders and this has been made available to all health service employers. The guide is also published on my Department's website.A survey of EU nursing pay rates by my Department indicated in 2003 that the average annual salary for a nurse with ten years experience is €30,247 per annum. In Ireland, the same nurse was paid €34,103 per annum which represents a premium of almost 13%. In the United Kingdom, a nurse with ten years experience earned €25,940 per annum. In Ireland, premium pay, which included overtime, unsocial hours and night duty rates, typically added a further 23% to basic earnings.Excellent relations and levels of co-operation have been established between the Irish and Filipino authorities, and I would like to place on the record my appreciation of the contribution Filipino nurses have made to our health service.

The ERHA is reporting an excess of €25 million approx. over the period budget of €1,053 million or a variance of 2.4%. The variance against period budget to end April for each sector is as followsVariance€mVoluntary Acute Sector9.308Voluntary Non-Acute Sector(0.838)Intellectual Disability Services Sector0.892Northern Area Health Board7.793East Coast Area Health Board2.690South West Area Health Board5.421ERHA CorporatenilTotal25.266The issues giving rise to the variance over budget, as identified by the ERHA, include an increase in acute hospital activity over the same period last year of 4% overall, with an increase in day case activity of 8.6%; non-pay costs, particularly in the area of clinical costs, including drugs and high cost treatments; and increased spending on demand-led schemes;The ERHA is continuing to work with its service providers to manage expenditure within the annual determination as required under the financial control framework, while continuing to respond to the pressure on accident and emergency and acute hospital services and the knock-on effect on services for older people. As stipulated by the Minister for Finance and set out as a requirement in the letter of determination, the ERHA has a contingency sum set aside to deal with unexpected issues and service pressures arising during the year.The over-riding accountability objective of my Department is to monitor the provision of health and children's services by reference to approved service plans and, in particular, to ensure that agencies, including ERHA, manage the delivery of services within the approved levels of expenditure.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	876	The Health service reform programme announced by the Government in June 2003 is primarily based on the recommendations of the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service, the Brennan report, and the Prospectus Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System together with the Report of the National Taskforce on Medical Staffing, the Hanly report.Implementation of the reform programme is now well underway. I announced the board of the interim HSE last November and the board has met on a number of occasions. The interim HSE was established as a statutory body on foot of SI 90/04 on 9 March. Under the establishment order, the interim HSE has been given the task of drawing up a plan for the transition to a unitary delivery system. The interim executive has also been given the task of making the necessary preparations to implement this plan, subject to ministerial approval, so as to ensure as smooth a transition as possible from the existing health board structure to the new Health Service Executive structure. It is intended that the Health Service Executive will be established on a full statutory basis by January 2005. Work on the preparation of the necessary primary legislation is well under way.The Government has appointed a national steering committee to oversee the implementation of the reform programme. The committee will report to the Cabinet Committee on the Health Strategy, ensuring that the Government is kept fully informed on all important issues.The Health (Amendment) Act 2004, which provides for the abolition of the membership of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards was commenced on the 15 June. The Act also repeals the provisions providing for the appointment of members to the Eastern Regional Health Authority, area health boards and health boards.An interim health information quality authority will be established on an administrative basis by early autumn. A financial transition team made up of representatives from my Department and the interim HSE are working together to lay the groundwork for the implementation of a number of the recommendations of the Brennan commission. The team is working to enable the HSE to comply with its role in the management and control of the health service delivery system from January 2005.A national service planning team has also been established made up of representatives from my Department and the Interim Health Service Executive. The team will be working on the development of a national service plan for 2005 and subsequent years with associated performance indicators and a robust monitoring and evaluation framework.The new system will provide a clear national focus on service delivery and executive management through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system. I am satisfied that the new arrangements, combined with the introduction of system-wide best practice governance and accountability systems, will ensure a more effective, efficient and responsive health system.

Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered, free of charge, to approximately 74,000 women in the 25 to 60 age group, at five year intervals.The Health Board Executive, HeBE, has commissioned an examination of the feasibility and implications of a national roll-out of a cervical screening programme. This is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications. The examination includes an evaluation of the pilot programme, policy development and the establishment of national governance arrangements. The evaluation of the pilot programme is a key element in informing the development of a high quality cervical screening model for Ireland. HeBE has advised that, when the evaluation report is completed, it will be in a position to prepare a draft plan for the national roll-out of a programme, for consideration by my Department.The number of smear tests carried out nationally has increased by almost 20% in recent years. In order to meet this increased demand, additional cumulative funding of €11 million has been provided by my Department since 2002 to enhance the laboratory and colposcopy services. This funding has enabled the laboratories to employ additional personnel, to purchase new equipment and to introduce new technology thereby increasing the volume of activity. In addition, a number of hospitals have undertaken initiatives such as contracting out of smear test analysis to external laboratories. These initiatives have resulted in a reduction in waiting times with, for example, the waiting time for routine results at Cork University Hospital being reduced from 129 days at March 2003 to less than 40 days currently.

I consider this to be particularly important given the key role of information in supporting and enabling reform. These reports each address one of the frameworks for change identified in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You. These are strengthening primary care, reform of the acute hospital system, funding, organisational reform and human resources. The remaining framework is information and is addressed by the national health information strategy.

The exact services to be provided in each hospital, including Loughlinstown, and the detailed medical staffing requirements to bring this about, will be part of the implementation group's remit.Unfortunately, the group has not been in a position to meet to date because of the non-participation of hospital consultants due to ongoing industrial relations difficulties.

I am aware that some health boards whose regions cover sparsely populated areas provide training in the use of portable defibrillators to appropriately qualified "first responders" such as fire crews. I have asked officials of my Department and the State Claims Agency, which operates the clinical indemnity scheme, to examine how the scheme might be able to offer indemnity cover to appropriately qualified and trained volunteers who agree to provide this service.

I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes during its current term.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	883	My Department is aware of reports of a rise in the number of persons suffering from asthma in this country. Conditions which may contribute to an increase in the prevalence of asthma include food allergies resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms and allergies to substances in the environment which may lead to a variety of skin conditions. It is accepted that some of the factors which may influence this situation include environmental factors, not only smoking and workplace exposure to respiratory irritants, but a more general level of exposure to environmental substances which cause allergies to occur.The Deputy may wish to note that at the Competitiveness (Internal Market, Industry and Research) Council on 22 September 2003 the Council approved a directive regarding the labelling of the ingredients present in foodstuffs. In particular, the new labelling rules aim to ensure that consumers suffering from food allergies, or who wish to avoid eating certain ingredients for any other reason, are informed of the ingredients present. The new directive also establishes a list of ingredients liable to cause allergies or intolerances. The new rules will also extend to alcoholic beverages if they contain an ingredient on the allergens list.The European Commission is currently developing an action plan on environment and health, which is expected to be adopted later this year. The plan is intended to reduce the disease burden caused by environmental factors in the EU with special emphasis on children, to identify and to prevent new health threats caused by environmental factors and to strengthen EU capacity for policy making in this area. Officials of my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are involved in this issue.At the recent meeting of EU chief medical officers, the chief medical officer of my Department placed the issues of food and asthma on the agenda in order to share experiences, information and knowledge with our EU partners on these issues. In addition, my Department has contacted the Health Research Board to discuss the issue of research into the incidence of asthma in the Irish population and the establishment of an asthma register is under discussion between professionals dealing with asthma and the ERHA.These initiatives should help to clarify some of the causative factors relating to these conditions and, more specifically, to identify contributing factors. Thus, preventative and treatment strategies can be more effectively developed and implemented.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	884	There are a number of initiatives under way at present in order to deal with pressures in emergency medicine departments in the eastern region.I provided €13.8 million to the ERHA in 2003-04 to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system to a more appropriate setting thereby freeing up acute beds. To date, a total of 286 patients in the eastern region has benefited from this initiative.I have provided additional annual revenue funding of €93 million and capital funding of €25 million to health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to commission 709 extra beds in the acute hospital sector. Over 270 new acute beds have been commissioned to date in the eastern region under the bed capacity initiative.Funding has been provided for the recruitment of additional emergency medicine consultants and consultant anaesthetists. The number of emergency medicine consultants in the eastern region has increased from ten to 21 in the past five years.A review of the nurse staffing levels in emergency departments is also being progressed by the Health Services Employers Agency in consultation with the health service management representatives and the nursing unions.General practitioner out-of-hours co-operatives have been established and are operating in at least part of all health board areas, with one health board, the North Eastern Health Board, having a region-wide project. A total of €46.5 million has been allocated for the development of out-of-hours co-operatives between 2000 and 2003, with an additional €24 million being provided in 2004.In order to ease pressure on the emergency medicine departments in the city the ERHA is reminding the public of the need to only attend the emergency department if absolutely necessary. This is to ensure that those in greatest need of care have immediate access to services. I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with the various health agencies in looking for short-term and longer-term solutions to the current difficulties.

Creatine is categorised as a food supplement in Ireland and in the European Union, and is available over the counter in health food and sports shops. It is also available over the Internet. Studies have shown that creatine can increase the performance of athletes in activities that require quick bursts of energy, such as sprinting, and can help athletes to recover faster after expending bursts of energy. It is also used by people with neuromuscular disorders under medical supervision.All food supplements, including creatine, must comply with general food labelling regulations which are enforced by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. I am advised by the FSAI that short-term exercise studies have not reported any adverse effects associated with creatine supplementation. While no long-term studies have been done to evaluate the safety of prolonged administration, a recent report from the French food safety authority said that adverse events involving the digestive, muscular and cardiovascular systems of people taking high dosages of creatine have occurred. It also warned that impurities could exist in creatine that is marketed to consumers. However, no published investigation has been conducted on creatine to determine what impurities might be present in creatine supplements, and what their long-term effect might be. The Department of Health and Children recommends a balanced diet and advises that the health effects of supplementation with high levels of creatine over extended periods have not been investigated. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, the consumption of high doses of creatine over a long period should be avoided.The European Commission recently published a draft directive on foods intended to meet the expenditure of intense muscular effort, especially for sports people. This draft incorporates the Scientific Committee on Food's, review of the safety aspects of creatine supplementation. The SCF noted that certain intakes of creatine are effective in increasing total muscle and improving performance of short-term, high-intensity exercise. However, high doses of creatine should be avoided. On the basis of this opinion, the draft directive states that it is appropriate that products containing creatine should have detailed instructions for use, including details on intake levels per day.Officials of my Department and of the FSAI are actively involved in the discussions on this draft directive which will be implemented into Irish law once adopted by the European Commission.

This is the issue which is of greatest concern to consultants arising from the introduction of the new indemnity arrangements. The Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation are kept informed of progress on a regular basis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	888	I presume this question has been prompted by concerns which have been raised about the implications for accident and emergency departments of the Report Of The National Task Force On Medical Staffing, the Hanly report. In fact, the Hanly report does not recommend the closure of accident and emergency departments. Instead, it argues that major hospitals should treat the most serious accident and emergency cases, namely, those requiring multi-specialist care. The great majority of current accident and emergency work would continue to be treated in hospitals such as Bantry.While the task force report contains specific recommendations regarding the configuration of acute hospital services in the two pilot regions studied, the East Coast Area Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board, no specific recommendations are made for other regions.The next phase of work will involve the preparation of a national plan for the reorganisation of acute hospital services by the acute hospitals review group.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	889	As the Deputy is aware the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government. As a matter of course, the medical card income guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The last such increase was notified in January 2004.It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the Health Boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the CEOs, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long term illness scheme, can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.The health strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the Health Board CEOs under the PPF which include streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.The strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Shorter waiting times for public patients is prioritised, with the expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of a treatment purchase fund. In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups including continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people; initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers/refugees and prisoners; and implementation of the NAPS targets relating to health.

My Department is currently awaiting a report from the ERHA and the NAHB on a number of issues regarding this proposal.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	891	Early this afternoon, notification was received from VHI stating that it intends to increase premiums by 3.8% for its hospital A to E plans and 2.5% for Options plans from 1 September 2004 as members renew. There is no increase for its primary care Healthsteps plans. My Department will now proceed to consider this notification.The following are the premium increases since June 1997:Effective date% Increase1 September 20038.5 (across hospital plans A to E and plan P)7.5 (across option plans)1 September 2002181 September 200191 February 20016.251 September 19999.41 September 199891 September 19979The cumulative increase amounts to 92.7%, with the average annual increase being just under 10%.Under VHI legislation, the VHI board has the primary responsibility to set premium rates. It is a matter for the VHI board, in discharging its responsibilities as regards setting premium levels, to take account of all the key considerations, including the matter of affordability for its members.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	892	I have examined the report commissioned by Ennis General Hospital Development Committee in response to the Hanly report. I am pleased that it supports a substantial number of the Hanly proposals and that it acknowledges that the report should not be rejected out of hand. This is in marked contrast to some of the comments offered about the report from other quarters.However, the report reaches some incorrect conclusions regarding the implications of the Hanly report for the future of Ennis General Hospital. For example, it compares staffing ratios and costs per case between Ennis General Hospital and other hospitals without taking account of differences in case complexity between smaller and larger hospitals. Comparisons of costs and staffing levels are meaningless unless the relative complexity and intensity of patients' treatment needs are taken into account. It is not possible to reach valid conclusions about the relative efficiency of hospitals without this information.The report incorrectly assumes all acute beds in Ennis would be closed and transferred to Limerick. The Hanly report does not propose the closure of any beds in local hospitals. Its recommendations are based on the provision of an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds as envisaged in the health strategy.The report also appears to expect that all accident and emergency cases currently seen in Ennis will be transferred to Limerick, with the effective complete closure of accident and emergency in the smaller hospitals. This incorrect assumption leads to a projected 35% increase in Limerick's accident and emergency numbers. In fact, the Hanly report argues that the major hospital should treat the most serious accident and emergency cases, namely, those requiring multi-specialist care. The great majority of current accident and emergency work would continue to be provided in hospitals such as Ennis.The report commissioned for the hospital committee analyses journey times to hospital in the context of the "golden hour". Unfortunately it seems to take no account of the approach set out in the Hanly report, which argues that the critical issue is speedy access to emergency treatment at the scene by first responders, such as trained ambulance personnel or general practitioners. This should be followed by rapid transfer to a hospital most able to meet their needs. The critical issue, therefore, is not journey time to the nearest hospital, but speed of access by trained personnel with onward transfer to the hospital most able to deal with serious cases. The critique later argues that reliance on ambulances would leave remote areas more vulnerable where an ambulance has been called away from that region; however this depends on the number of ambulances available and their positioning within the region.Finally, the critique points to a "population explosion" brought about by tourism in the summer months in the west Clare region. Any additional workload for accident and emergency services brought about by this increase is already reflected in the accident and emergency activity recorded in Ennis General Hospital. It was therefore taken into account by the Hanly group when framing its recommendations.Overall, I welcome the work commissioned by the Ennis General Hospital Development Committee in analysing the Hanly report. I am pleased it is very supportive of many aspects of the Hanly report but its key criticisms are based on a series of incorrect assumptions which need to be challenged.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	893	The issue of manpower in general practice in the new primary care settings is being addressed by the HR education and training subgroup of the primary care national steering group. Representatives from the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners are on this group along with other stakeholders.The intake of trainees into general practice vocational training programmes in recent years has increased from 55 in 1998 to 84 in 2003, reflecting an acknowledgement that provisions had to be made to ensure for the future manpower needs in general practice. In fact, 186 applications were received for inclusion in the GP training schemes in 2003, giving a clear indication that general practice is still an attractive specialist option for graduates. In view of the recruitment and retention needs of general practitioners, my Department is consulting with the Irish College of General Practitioners with a view to achieving an increase of up to 50% in the number of training places available.My Department has provided €1.314 million in 2003 for GP vocational training schemes and will seek to maintain and, I hope, increase funding in this area, as resources permit.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	894	I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 203, 205, 213 and 214 together.Responsibility for the collection and reporting of waiting lists and waiting times now falls within the remit of the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. This will result in a more accurate and complete picture being available of the numbers waiting and more importantly the length of time they are waiting for their procedures. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive of the NTPF to respond directly to the Deputy regarding the number of patients awaiting treatment for surgical procedures.With regard to waiting times, the NTPF has reported that 80% of patients now wait less than one year for surgical treatment. The NTPF has also reported that waiting times have fallen significantly in the past year with 37% of patients now waiting between three and six months and 43% waiting between six and 12 months for surgery. This represents a major reduction in the length of time patients have to wait. Patients who have been waiting more than six months for treatment can also contact the NTPF directly or through their general practitioners to arrange treatment.While the rate of progress in achieving the targets set out in the health strategy has been slower than anticipated, the targets still remain a goal to be achieved and I will continue to keep the focus on reducing waiting lists and waiting times.It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods. These beds are not decommissioned but are temporarily out of use for a variety of reasons such as ward refurbishment, essential ward maintenance, staff leave, seasonal closures and infection control measures. Data collected by my Department show that the total bed days lost due to beds being temporarily out of use in 2003 represents approximately 3% of the overall available acute bed stock.Increasing the capacity of the acute hospital system continues to be a priority. I have provided additional annual revenue funding of €93 million and capital funding of €25 million to health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to commission 709 extra beds in the acute hospital sector as part of the Government's commitment under the health strategy to provide an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds over the period to 2011. Some 589 of these beds have been commissioned to date and funding has been made available to health boards and the ERHA to commission the balance of the 709 beds.My Department will continue to work with health agencies to bring on stream buildings, facilities and equipment which are being provided under the national development plan. The additional revenue required to open these new facilities will have to be considered against the background of available resources and other competing priorities.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	895	I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 209, 210 together.Staffing requirements in the areas highlighted by the Deputy should be viewed in light of the very substantial increases in employment levels achieved in the health service overall in recent years. The Deputy may wish to note that there has been an increase in the level of employment of 23,706, excluding home helps, in whole-time equivalence terms since 1999, or 32.6%. In this context, comparing employment levels at the end of December 2003 to those at end-1999, there were 26%, +1,407, more medical/dental personnel and 85%, +5,853, more health and social care professionals employed in the health services in whole-time equivalent, WTE, terms. In 1998 there were 26,612 whole-time equivalent nurses employed in the public health system. By the end of December 2003 this figure had reached 33,765. This is an increase of more than 7,150 during the period, or 26.8%.Developments such as pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development have all supported increased staffing levels for key health and social care professions. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body — which are subject to the successful ongoing completion of the performance verification process — are making a further important contribution to recruitment and improved retention. The continued implementation of the action plan for people management — a key action under the health strategy — has a crucial role in improving retention and reducing turnover of skilled staff.The Deputy may wish to note that specific human resource initiatives in key areas will contribute significantly to meeting the workforce requirements of the health services.As far as medical personnel are concerned the report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing details the number of consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors that will be required in the coming years to provide a high quality, consultant-provided service.The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, has been substantially improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission On Nursing and the 1999 nurses' pay settlement. The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery has been especially active in this area and, to date, 1,563 clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner posts have been created.Figures from An Bord Altranais for the same period indicate that there is a steady stream of new entrants into the profession, over and above those graduating from the Irish system, thus further increasing the potential recruitment pool. Since 1998, the total number of nurses newly registered by An Bord Altranais is 19,945. Of this number, 13,658 were overseas nurses.According to the most recent survey of nursing vacancies by the Health Service Employers Agency, the number of nursing vacancies stood at 705 at the end of March 2004. This represents a 49% reduction in the number of vacancies reported at the end of September 2000.The current nursing vacancy rate of less than 2% could be considered to be a normal frictional rate, given that there will always be some level of movement due to resignations, retirements and nurses availing of opportunities to change employment and locations.Significant progress has also been achieved in doubling the total number of professional therapy training places, namely, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy — in line with the recommendations of the report entitled Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, commissioned by my Department from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates and published in June 2001.On the prioritisation of particular service and geographical areas, such as those mentioned by the Deputy, it should be noted that responsibility for human resource planning rests with the chief executive officer, CEO, of each board. Each CEO in managing the workforce in his/her region is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling.

The projected full project cost is €101.4 million. This includes an amount of €5 million approved last year to facilitate refurbishment works at the hospital which are necessary as part of the transition process to the new hospital and to facilitate a land transfer in line with the project development arrangements.My Department is advised that the first phase of the transition to the new development at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, has been completed. The coronary care and cardiac unit, the therapeutic psychiatry of old age unit, day hospital and the rheumatology service transferred to the new building in September 2003.The further commissioning of this development is currently being examined by the ERHA and my Department.

There are discontinuities in the series in 1990 and 1985 and two sets of figures have been supplied for each of those years. This arises in the case of 1990 due to the accounts being compiled according to new rules — the ESA95 system as opposed to the ESA 1970 system. However, the values of GDP under the new and old systems are supplied for 1990.In the case of 1985, the discontinuity arises due to improved methodologies being adopted while it was not possible to revise retrospectively prior to 1985. Here again, two sets of figures using the new and old methodologies have been provided for the year 1985.The GDP figures per capita in other OECD countries, in US dollars for the relevant years beginning with 1970, have been supplied in Table 2. These have been taken from the OECD website. OECD cannot provide the data prior to 1970. The conversion into dollars has been done using a special PPP, purchasing power parity, rate that compares the price of a representative basket of goods in each country rather than using the currency exchange rates. Similar tables in constant terms can be obtained on the OECD website.

This percentage was recommended by the National Minimum Wage Commission to strike a balance between ensuring that young employees are not exploited and ensuring that the rate of pay does not encourage students to leave full-time education.The National Minimum Wage Commission recommended that sub-minimum rates should also apply to employees in the first two years of employment over age 18 and to those undergoing structured training. These recommendations were endorsed by the interdepartmental group on implementation of a national minimum wage and implemented in the minimum wage legislation.Regulations — SI 99 of 2000 — prescribe the criteria that a course of study or training must satisfy before these sub-minimum rates can apply. These include the requirement that the course must include an assessment and certification procedure.The National Minimum Wage Act does not apply to statutory apprentices within the meaning of or under the Industrial Training Act 1967 or the Labour Services Act 1987.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	903	The current legislative regulatory framework for consumer protection makes provision for false trade descriptions. Section 2 of the Consumer Information Act 1978 makes it an offence to apply a false trade description to a product. These offences are prosecuted by the Director of Consumer Affairs. In addition, the consumer has rights under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 regarding breaches as to the warranty of a particular product.At the competitiveness Council on 18 May 2004 the unfair commercial practices directive received political agreement. This measure will create harmonised rules for the protection of consumers against misleading, unfair or aggressive practices which harm consumers economic interests.The directive contains a list of practices which are considered at all times unfair and consequently prohibited. One of these banned practices is "falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illness, dysfunction or malformation". This directive will probably be formally adopted by the Council later this year after which it will be transposed into Irish law.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	904	The killing of Private Thomas Barrett and Private Derek Smallhorne and the wounding of Private John O'Mahony while serving with UNIFIL was an abhorrent crime. The legal issues in this case have been reviewed on a number of occasions in the context of ascertaining whether persons alleged to have committed this awful crime could be brought to justice.I have previously consulted the Attorney General on the question of the possibility of seeking the extradition to the State for trial here of the alleged perpetrators of this crime. However, I have been advised that the Irish courts do not have jurisdiction for acts, such as this, committed by non-nationals outside the State and that extradition proceedings would, therefore, have to be initiated in the country where the crime was committed, namely, in Lebanon.As the Deputy will be aware, the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, which was inspired by the need to improve the level of protection of people, such as the late Privates Barrett and Smallhorne, serving on UN missions and to ensure the punishment of individuals who do not respect the mandate of UN peacekeepers, entered into force on 15 January 1999. The convention, however, does not apply retrospectively.I will continue to explore such avenues as may be open to me to seek justice in respect of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne. However, it is the case that, given the passage of time, building a prima facie case at this remove is likely to prove difficult.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	906	The farm waste management scheme does not provide grant aid for the repair of existing buildings. However, when the revised farm waste management scheme was introduced in January of this year, I decided to provide grant aid for the removal of single slats and their replacement by gang slats as an exceptional safety measure. Gang slats tend to be inherently safer than single slats and are now manufactured to a more rigorous standard specification. I have no plans to extend grant-aid under the scheme to the replacement of existing gang slats by new gang slats.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	907	The detailed specification referred to by the Deputy is for the use of professional planners and is designed to assist them in drawing up REPS 3 plans. Farmers are not obliged to refer to the specification; instead, I have introduced a separate publication called the REPS Farmer’s Handbook which explains plainly and in user-friendly terms what the farmer must do to comply with the scheme.Mapping requirements for each REPS undertaking are clearly set out and are similar to those under REPS 2. The need for amended plans has been reduced in REPS 3; they will now be needed only where there is a significant change to the land area or the farming system.A sum of €1.3 million has already been invested in providing on-line access to Ordnance Survey maps for REPS planning purposes. I am making a further investment in an on-line REPS planning system, which is currently being developed by Teagasc and the Agricultural Consultants' Association and will be available to planners later this year. This will lead to further efficiencies and less time required for the preparation of plans.REPS planners are no longer required to examine title documentation regarding REPS farms, except where the land is leased or part of a commonage. They are now required to visit a farm only once during the course of a REPS contract, whereas annual visits were required in previous years.All of these changes will lead to a reduction in the time taken to prepare plans and in the planner's ongoing involvement in REPS contracts, and I would expect this to be reflected in reduced costs to the farmer.

The resultant lower levels of employment growth will mean that productivity growth will become a key ingredient in economic growth. In this context, increased labour force participation rates, particularly amongst female and older age groups, will be crucial.The falling proportion of those of working age will be a factor which will impact on many aspects of budgetary policy going forward, including taxation policy.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	915	I have no plans to provide for special treatment of child care facilities under the Valuation Act. The Valuation Act 2001 maintained the long-standing position that commercial facilities — including child care facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, crèches and Montessori schools — are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other useful services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist. The process could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value, NAV, which is the rental value of the property. Any rate payer dissatisfied with the rateability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent valuation tribunal.

In July 2001 the Central Bank issued guidance on "Additional Characteristics of Prudent Home Loan Assessment", the main focus of which was to strengthen lending practices. The bank has required that stress-testing techniques be performed in credit institutions to measure the capacity of lending institutions to withstand economic shocks. In November 2002 credit institutions were advised not to relax their lending criteria in order to increase their market share. They were also advised to alert their borrowers to the risks associated with all mortgage based lending products and to remain fully alert to the dangers of lending to marginal borrowers. However, it is the obligation of each credit institution and its board to ensure that prudent lending policies are adopted, that the appropriate standards are maintained and that loan books are of a sufficiently high quality to withstand an economic shock.The Financial Services Regulator performed a mortgage credit review in the first quarter of 2003. The overall general findings from that inspection were that no matters of financial soundness came to light, however credit institutions were required to put more robust procedures in place in the area of client income verification and the funding of mortgage loan balances to ensure that loans are properly secured and will be repaid in full. It is important to note that the majority of credit institutions now utilise net disposable income criteria in underwriting mortgage applications. Net disposable income criteria are considered to be a more accurate reflection of repayment capacity. For example, a simple multiple would not capture the difference in the ability to make repayments on a loan at 10% interest and at 3% interest. An examination of net disposable income can capture this difference. At the same time, this has to be combined with a stress-test of the loan to assess the ability to repay should interest rates increase from current levels.As will be clear from the foregoing, the question of the level of borrowing/lending that would be appropriate is, in the first instance a matter for the borrowers and lenders themselves, subject to overall monitoring from a prudential regulatory aspect by IFSRA, which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions. I have no plans for any detailed legislation in this area at this time. Should IFSRA report to me at any time that it felt it required additional powers in this regard, I would respond quickly to such a request.

If an individual's chargeable gains in a year are no greater than this amount, there is no CGT liability in respect of those gains. If the chargeable gains are greater than this amount, €1,270 continues to be deducted from the gains before calculating the liability. A CGT rate of 20% applies, which was halved from 40% in Budget 1998.Section 31 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that the total amount of chargeable gains arising in that year of assessment is arrived at after deducting: (a) any allowable losses accruing to that person in that year of assessment; and (b) in so far as they have not been allowed as a deduction from chargeable gains in any previous year of assessment, any allowable losses accruing to that person in any previous year of assessment.This approach ensures that taxpayers in the same net situation — individuals with net gains after deducting any losses compared with individuals with gains of a similar amount without any losses — are treated equally. The annual exemption is then allowed after the net gains have been established.This is similar to what is applied in income tax relating to the carry forward of the unused losses from earlier years. Under the normal set-off rules for income tax, any unused trading losses from a previous year would come forward against future profits from the same trade before establishing the individual's level of income for income tax exemption or marginal relief purposes in that year and before the granting of any personal allowances, reliefs or tax credits. Likewise, where rental income is involved, the normal tax rules apply which provide that any unused rental losses would be brought forward and be offset against the rental income in the subsequent year of assessment before any personal allowances, reliefs and tax credits are granted.In view of the considerations outlined such that the current system treats taxpayers equally and is consistent with the approach adopted regarding other taxes, such as income tax, I have no plans to change the capital gains tax code as suggested by the Deputy.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost of making all personal tax credits refundable when they are unused including the personal and employee credits, the home carer tax credit, the one-parent family credit and the age credit as well as the minor personal credits such as incapacitated child credit and the blind person's credit, is broadly in the region of €1.6 billion annually.The main category of refund would relate to the basic personal credit — single, married and widowed — where the annual cost of refunding the unused portion of the credit to income earners with insufficient income to fully absorb it would amount to approximately €830 million. The next two categories of refund in order of scale would be the employee credit, approximately €660 million, and the home carer credit, approximately €70 million. The figure of €1.6 billion above relates only to the cost of extending refundable tax credits to all those on Revenue's tax files. If a refundable tax credit system were to be introduced, one would have to consider those who are not on the tax files, for example, those who are of employable age but not working. This would increase the cost significantly.Apart from the issue of cost, there would be a range of other policy and practical difficulties arising in introducing such a system. I have no plans to introduce refundable tax credits at present.

However, in certain circumstances I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners take the view that racehorse trainers are entitled to farm buildings allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on structures such as stables and yards. To qualify, a trainer must have the use of land or the right to graze livestock on land. The qualifying expenditure can be written off over seven years at the rate of 15% for the first six years and 10% for the seventh year.Tax relief may also be available under one of the general property-based incentive schemes, depending on where the premises are to be located and the circumstances of the case. Tax relief is available for certain commercial premises under the urban renewal, town renewal and rural renewal schemes. Based on the information supplied it is not possible to say if tax relief under one of these schemes might apply in this case. The person concerned should check with his or her local authority to ascertain if the area in which the stable and arena is to be built has been designated for tax incentive purposes. If the outcome of that inquiry is positive the person concerned should then contact the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Business Income Tax, Ship Street Gate, Dublin Castle, Dublin 2, whose phone numbers are 01-6475473 and 01-6475432, for further advice.

The majority of member states avail of this option. In Ireland the reduced rate of mineral oil tax is €47.36 per 1,000 litres for marked gas oil or "green diesel" as against a standard rate of €368.05 per 1,000 litres for regular road diesel. The VAT rate applicable to marked gas oil is 13.5% and the VAT rate for regular road diesel is 21%. So-called "off-road" dumpers qualify to use fuel at the reduced rate regardless of where they are used. However, the use of such vehicles on public roadways is subject to special permits issued by local authorities in accordance with Article 17 of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963, SI 190 of 1963. The Revenue Commissioners do not have any data on the extent of on-road usage of these dumpers.

The stamp duty charged on a credit card account is now €40 per annum. The stamp duty arises irrespective of the age of the person holding the account.I do not believe this charge is excessive in the circumstances and there is no evidence that it significantly discourages people from using this form of transaction. If an exemption were introduced for one group of people, such as the over-65s, there would be demands for similar treatment for others and the tax base could be significantly curtailed. I do not, therefore, intend introducing an exemption from the stamp duty concerned.As the Deputy knows, the Government has done more for those aged 65 and over than many previous Governments. The income tax age exemption limits have been increased by approximately 135% since 1997, removing 81,300 elderly people from the tax net. The current rate of payment for old age pensions has increased by approximately 69% over the rate payable in 1997. This is well ahead of the rate of inflation and represents an enormous improvement in the living standards of our older citizens.

The Civil Service Commissioners are involved in recruitment to a range of positions in the Civil Service.Recruitment is by way of open competition. All competitions held by the commissioners are advertised in one or more of the national papers and on their web site at: www.publicjobs.ie. Application forms, together with all relevant details, are only available when competitions are announced. However, potential candidates can register their interest in a position on the Civil Service Commission website and will then automatically be notified by e-mail when the competition is announced. From time to time the Civil Service Commission may advertise for positions in existing offices outside Dublin.Under the decentralisation programme, the Government has decided to relocate more than 10,000 civil and public service jobs to 53 locations in 25 other counties outside Dublin. The decentralisation central applications facility gives information about the new locations and jobs. It allows certain public servants to apply for transfer to posts at the same or equivalent level in decentralised locations and to rank preferences for different locations. Applications can be made on the CAF website at: www.publicjobscaf.ie.  In the medium to longer term, it will be necessary to consider the development of regional recruitment and promotion systems building on the existing regional arrangements. This will be the subject of further discussions with the Civil Service unions.

However, where goods are sold to an employee for a price that is below his or her employer's cost of such goods, the difference between that cost and the price paid by the employee is a taxable benefit giving rise to a liability to tax and PRSI under the PAYE system.It is understood that some retail companies operate for their employees a discount system under which the employees are given a voucher that may be redeemed at any branch of the company against future purchases. In these circumstances, the value of the voucher given to the employee, like all other vouchers given by an employer to an employee, is liable to tax and PRSI under the PAYE system.

The nation grieved for their loss and our sympathy for their loved ones has not diminished with the passage of time.The legal issues in this case have been reviewed on a number of occasions with a view to determining whether persons alleged to have committed these crimes could be brought to justice. The Government has engaged in close consultation with the United States authorities on the question of bringing to justice the alleged perpetrator who is understood to be resident in the US and is a naturalised US citizen. The Deputy will understand that I am not in a position to go into detail. I can, however, assure him that the US authorities have been very helpful in the course of these consultations.The question of seeking the extradition to the State for trial here of the alleged perpetrators of these crimes does not arise because the Irish courts do not have jurisdiction to try persons for acts such as these committed by non-nationals outside the State. An extradition request would therefore have to be made by the country where the crime was committed, namely Lebanon, with a view to a criminal prosecution there.As the Deputy will be aware, the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, which was inspired by the need to improve the level of protection of personnel such as Private Barrett and Private Smallhorne serving on UN Missions, and to ensure the punishment of individuals who do not respect the mandate of UN peacekeepers, entered into force on 15 January 1999. The convention, however, does not apply retrospectively. The Government will continue to explore such avenues as may be open to it to seek justice in this tragic case.

As I have said before, the report contains a large number of wide-ranging recommendations, which will have to be implemented on a phased basis over a period of years. Action is currently being taken on more than two-thirds of the 71 recommendations contained in the report. A special group in my Department, chaired by the Secretary General, is meeting on a fortnightly basis to monitor progress in implementing the recommendations.I have asked the DION committee to give priority to the needs of elderly and vulnerable emigrants in Britain in line with the recommendations of the task force. Last year, approximately €1.3 million, more than half the DION fund, went to vulnerable groups. Of this, €873,000 was allocated to projects to support the older Irish in Britain, €119,000 to projects for returning emigrants, and €332,000 to projects for Irish Travellers in Britain. This year, I have increased substantially the allocation of the DION fund to €3.57 million. This will enable a further increase in the provision of support to the elderly Irish in Britain.

This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.In the current school year the mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy is a principal plus 15 mainstream posts based on an enrolment of 398 pupils at 30 September 2002. The enrolment of the school at 30 September 2003 was 374 pupils, which warrants a staffing of a principal and 13 mainstream posts for the 2004-05 school year. The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. School authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.To ensure transparency and openness in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing.

Sustaining Progress set the achievement of a standard school year as a requirement for all primary and post-primary schools in the country. In encompassing all schools in both sectors it was designed to bring certainty and clarity on a countrywide basis to the arrangements for the vacation periods covered by the agreement.

In addition, he or she should advise and liaise with other teachers, parents and relevant professionals in the children's interest.Learning support teachers provide additional teaching support for pupils with literacy or numeracy difficulties who score at or below the tenth percentile in standardised tests of literacy and numeracy. My Department has been developing a new weighted system for the allocation of teacher resources, which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessments; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs. Under the weighted system, the post of learning support teacher and resource teacher will be merged to provide an allocation of special education teacher posts to primary schools.Special class teachers are allocated to special schools and to special classes attached to mainstream primary schools. Such classes operate with enhanced pupil teacher ratios, for example, 6:1 in the case of pupils with severe or profound general learning disability, GLD, and 8:1 for pupils with a moderate GLD.Special needs assistants are recruited specifically to assist in the care of pupils with disabilities in an educational context. They may be appointed to a special school or a mainstream school in cases where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils.

My Department has delegated authority to NEPS to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students who need it in primary and post-primary schools and in other relevant centres supported by my Department. The Government also agreed that NEPS should be established in the first instance on an administrative basis as a dedicated executive agency of my Department and with an initial development period of five years. The NEPS agency was established accordingly with effect from 1 September 1999.Contact details for NEPS, including its network of regional offices and telephone numbers etc. are available under NEPS on my Department's website www.education.gov.ie.

In essence, the National Council for Special Education will operate under two main headings. On foot of research to be commissioned by the council, it will define models of appropriate educational response for categories of special need, and it will assist in the delivery at ground level on the needs of individual students, mainly through the deployment of a new grade of special education needs organisers, SENOs.The objective in establishing the new council is to have clarity of entitlement, an accessible service at local level and speedy delivery. The council will define the most appropriate educational response for various categories of special need. This will involve drawing on research and international best practice. The establishment of the council should impact on equality by ensuring that special educational services are provided to a standard comparable to best international practice and through simplifying access to those services through the deployment of special education needs organisers.The SENOs will be responsible for ensuring that all special educational needs in their areas are addressed in an effective manner. They will be charged with facilitating access to and co-ordinating education services for children with special needs in their areas by liasing between local providers of educational services, local providers of necessary ancillary services, the council, the Department and parents. In many cases provision will be based on individual education plans for the children involved.The first council has been appointed and the inaugural meeting was held on 2 February last. The council will assume its direct service role in 2004 following the recruitment and training of the special education needs organisers.

The criteria and procedures relating to the allocation of special needs assistant support are outlined in my Department's circular 07/02. This circular may be accessed on my Department's website under the heading "Children with Special Needs". The detailed arrangements for processing applications for special education resources, including those for special needs assistants, will be set out in an interim circular to be issued to all schools in the coming week.

The partnerships would provide for tuition in instrumental and vocal music performance for children and adults as well as curriculum supports for the school system. The Donegal submission proposed a pilot of the model set out in the national report to cater for the Donegal region. My Department has been examining the scope for an initial development in this area and I will inform the Deputy of the outcome of this process.

SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including those from the school in question, have now been considered. The applications have been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. The applications have been further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision. It is intended that applicant schools will be notified of the outcomes of their cases in the coming week.

My attention has not been drawn to financial difficulties being experienced by either school. In addition to capitation grants, both of these schools receive additional funding under the disadvantage initiative scheme.Primary schools' running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. In the case of primary schools, the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57 in 1997 to €121.58 per pupil from 1 January last. This represents an increase of almost 113% over the period. I am committed to improving further the funding position of primary schools in the context of available resources.

However, if there is a specific period for which details are required, I will have further enquiries made. The person in question is employed as a special needs assistant, or SNA, in a national school in County Mayo. An application by this person for incremental credit as an SNA for previous experience was not approved by my Department as no evidence was provided to indicate the person had previous experience as an SNA or in a similar care role.

While it is a matter for the Select Committee on Education and Science and the Houses to accept or reject amendments to legislation, the debates held on this Bill were particularly constructive. I was anxious to reflect the views of others in my own amendments wherever possible. The Bill underwent very substantial changes as a result of the comments of all the Deputies involved.On Report Stage, I moved more than 70 amendments to accommodate arguments made by the Deputy and others on Committee Stage. In many cases, those arguments were made separately by several Deputies including Deputy McGrath. The amendments were accepted by the House. In addition to the amendments I moved on Report Stage, a small number of amendments moved by others were accepted by the House, including one moved by the Deputy. These changes have very significantly improved the provisions of the Bill and I record again my thanks to all those who participated in our discussions.

However, in the context of the available funding and the number of applications for it, it was not possible to approve all applications for temporary accommodation this year. Only those with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved. All other schools are required, as an interim measure, to maximise the use of existing accommodation until my Department is in a position to make extra accommodation available.

It is intended that the centre will be purchased in the near future and operated on a joint North-South basis to serve the needs of children and young persons with autism in both jurisdictions. The matter is being progressed jointly by my Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland and the costs involved will be shared on an equal basis. The purchase cost is £3 million sterling. Precise details of the annual operating costs will not be available until final decisions have been taken on the level of staffing and specialist inputs required. Proposals for the centre envisage a learning support service, an educational assessment service, a training and advisory service and an autism research, dissemination and information service.

This project is at early stages of architectural planning and has been assigned a band 3 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the schools building programme which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects not progressing to tender in this year’s programme including the school referred to by the Deputy. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.

The resolution of the dispute is a matter for the authorities of the school in the first instance. However, I urge all involved to take all the necessary steps to resolve the dispute as speedily as possible having due regard to the rights of all concerned.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	966	My Department allocates resource teacher posts and special needs assistant posts to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for students with special educational needs. Applications for such supports are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupil or pupils involved and the nature and level of the support provided is determined on the advice of the psychological service.An application seeking the continued allocation of resources to address the special educational needs of a number of students in the school, including the student to whom the Deputy refers, was submitted to my Department by the VEC concerned. Following examination of this application, my Department allocated an additional 43.40 teaching hours plus 82 special needs assistant hours per week for the 2004-2005 school year to address the needs of these students. It is a matter for the VEC to deploy this allocation and review this deployment in line with the evolving needs of the students concerned. If the VEC is of the view that the prevailing level of assessed special needs within the school is such as to be incapable of being addressed from within the approved allocation, my Department will be prepared to consider its concerns.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	967	Recently, I announced the establishment of a renewable energy development group to be chaired by my Department. The group comprises relevant experts from across the sector and will advise on future policies, targets, programmes and support measures taking into account the associated economic, social and environmental impacts of the development and deployment of renewable energy. The promotion of renewable energy technologies, of which wind energy is the dominant form at this time, is a priority of this Government. As Minister with responsibility for energy policy, my immediate goal is to add an additional 500 MW of renewables based electricity generating capacity to the electricity network by 2005 to deliver the target published in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy. In addition, I have announced that subject to EU state aids clearance I will support the building of an additional 218 MW of new renewable energy projects.The 500 MW target is currently being implemented and will be achieved in the main under contracts offered by me under the fifth and sixth alternative energy requirement competitions. While I am confident of securing state aids clearance for the additional 218 MW which will be allocated to AER VI projects, I cannot commit to individual projects until the European Commission has finalised its position on the state aids notification. The AER VI competition was based on lowest bid price and only the lowest compliant tenders were offered contracts up to the capacity threshold defined for each technology class. This process ensures that the general customer incurs the smallest price increase on their electricity bills through the operation of the public service obligation levy. The process was oversubscribed and as with any competition not everyone who takes part can be successful. While some of the unsuccessful competitors may be disappointed with the fact that they were not selected on this occasion, the terms and conditions of the competition were clearly stated and all of the competitors acknowledged receipt of and accepted these terms and conditions when they entered the competition.I am confident that those projects which were successful in the competition will proceed to completion. In the event that any project does not, a reserve list is in place to take up any capacity that is surrendered. The completion of AER VI will close the current chapter of support for renewable energy technologies. However, at the end of last year I published a consultation document, Options for Future Renewable Energy Policy, Targets and Programmes. The consultation document and supporting annexes which examine in detail support mechanisms and renewable energy policies in Ireland as well as in other European countries were published on my Department's website. The document, which will be used to map out a future strategy for green energy in the coming years, follows a commitment I gave after the conclusion of the AER VI competition.The consultation document considered key areas in the future including future renewables policy, future green energy contribution to Ireland's electricity markets, how to overcome barriers to the deployment of renewable energy and future options for market support mechanisms. Respondents were asked to outline their proposals in detail and to estimate the cost of any support measures they proposed. Over 40 responses were received and are currently being analysed with the technical assistance of Sustainable Energy Ireland. The analyses of the consultation document submissions will feed into the work of the renewable energy development group. It is intended that a new policy for developing the renewable energy sector will be submitted to Government for approval later this year.In relation to generating capacity, the Commission for Energy Regulation continues to monitor the security of supply situation. The commission has initiated a number of positive actions to redress postulated generation capacity shortfalls in the short, medium and longer term as forecast by the ESB National Grid in its generation adequacy report which was published on 27 November 2003. In addition, the ESB is currently undertaking a significant networks investment programme of some €4 billion up to 2007 to bring the transmission and distribution systems up to required international standards and to meet projected capacity demand requirements. Furthermore, the Government has given its approval to proceed with the development of two 500 MW interconnectors between Ireland and Great Britain, while the desirability and feasibility of further interconnection North and South is being investigated.Sustainable Energy Ireland, the independent non-commercial state body focused exclusively on sustainable use of energy including deployment of renewable energy sources, has commenced a challenging work programme to increase energy efficiency and to promote renewable energy technologies. In the renewable energy field specifically, Sustainable Energy Ireland has opened a research, development and demonstration programme for renewable energy technologies. The programme is open to a wide range of proposals including policy studies, field research, feasibility studies and technology research development and demonstration.

Both rock types contain the mineral dolomite and it is the proportion of the latter that distinguishes the difference between the two rock types. Visual and chemical analyses provided for the deposit currently being worked at Maddoxtown, Bennettsbridge, County Kilkenny, show that the rocks are dolomite. In the area of the proposed extension, the existing mine lessee's experts, using chemical testing, identified dolomitic limestone in their limited drilling programme in 2002. As pointed out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 228 on 25 May 2004, this testing work followed an earlier drilling programme in 1996 which identified a potential dolomite resource in this area. The area of the proposed extension, like that in the area currently being mined, therefore contains minerals scheduled under the Acts.Comprehensive chemical analysis in the area of the proposed extension have not been carried out by the mining company because it is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence that a sizeable mineral deposit exists. However, it might be worthwhile to carry out the analyses if the cost is reasonable. The Department will pursue this issue with the company and I will inform the Deputy of the outcome.

These have involved sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country assisting in the provision of sport and recreational facilities. Under this programme, grants totalling €2.57 million were allocated towards the development of a new stadium in Tallaght for Shamrock Rovers Football Club in each of the three years 2000, 2001 and 2002. These allocations were made following an application from the club and a recommendation from the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, that such funding should be provided to enable one of Dublin's oldest clubs to have its own facilities.While responsibility for the delivery of this project rests with the club, my Department has written directly to the club on a number of occasions since the last grant payment was made in May 2002 requesting information on its likely completion date. In October 2002, the club advised my Department that costs on the project had risen considerably and they were in discussions with a number of interested parties in an effort to secure additional funding to complete it. The importance of completing the stadium has been raised at a number of meetings between my Department and the FAI. On 26 March 2004, the club informed my Department of further ongoing discussions with interested parties which could lead to a proposal to complete the stadium. My Department is in contact with the FAI to investigate how this matter can be progressed to a satisfactory conclusion.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	973	I am aware of concerns expressed by some persons in regard to hyper-sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation from phone masts. The Irish Electromagnetic Radiation Victims Network, IERVN, is an organisation representing their interests. My Department corresponds with IERVN on an ongoing basis and my officials have also met with its representatives. Scientific research to date has not established a causal relationship between electromagnetic radiation and ill health. Research is ongoing in this area and my Department will continue to review the findings of all new peer-reviewed studies.In the absence of evidence of a causal relationship between electromagnetic radiation and ill-health, the approach adopted in Ireland is to minimise exposure in accordance with the 1999 recommendations of the European Community on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields. These recommendations are based on the 1998 guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation, ICNIRP, covering the frequency range from 0-300 GHz. Telecommunications companies licensed to operate in Ireland are required to comply with these recommendations.The monitoring of emission levels from masts is a function of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. My Department is in regular contact with the office of the chief technical advisor in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources which represents Ireland's interests in the relevant international organisations — the World Health Organisation, the EU and the International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety.

One such initiative was the establishment of the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol in January 2002, to recommend evidence based measures to Government, aimed at reducing and preventing alcohol related harm. Following a comprehensive review of the most effective alcohol policy measures by international experts, an interim report was published in May 2002. A second report, containing further recommendations, will be published in the near future. An interdepartmental group has been established to co-ordinate responses to the recommendations.The health promotion unit of my Department has also provided funding to the Irish College of General Practitioners to implement an alcohol aware practice project to assist the GP in being more effective in helping patients with alcohol problems.National policy on the treatment of alcohol abuse, as set out in Planning for the Future, stipulates that the emphasis in the management of alcohol related problems should be on community-based interventions. Health boards already provide and continue to develop a range of comprehensive community-based support services appropriate to the needs of persons affected and afflicted by alcohol abuse. These services include family support and community, medical and social services in the management of the problem.The main therapeutic tools in the treatment of alcohol addiction are psychotherapy, counselling, family and martial therapy, either individually or in group settings. Therapy may take place in residential or day settings. As alcohol related problems occur, in many instances, in local and family settings, the community-based response can be direct and early, thereby reducing the associated levels of physical, psychological and social problems.Legislation is presently being drafted within my Department to reduce the over-exposure of young people to alcohol advertising and marketing practices.

When introduced, the framework was welcomed both by health boards and prospective adopters, and it is regarded very highly in countries from which Irish people adopt. The framework is being implemented nationally.Assessments for intercountry and domestic adoptions are carried out by health boards or by registered adoption societies. At the outset of the process, applicants are placed on a health board/adoption society waiting list for assessment. The waiting list for assessment varies throughout the country. The assessment process itself involves a number of stages and would generally include an initial assessment, a considerable level of education/preparation work (including an exploration with prospective adoptive parents of the challenges and issues that are likely to arise when undertaking adoption) and a home study assessment. The length of the process can vary between applicants depending on the particular circumstances of each case, bearing in mind at all times the best interests of the child.The length of time it takes to complete the necessary assessment and the allocation of resources within the health board is a matter for the management of each individual health board.

The ERHA has now advised that charges were applied by the hospital under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987. The hospital has also advised that charges were inappropriate in this case. The ERHA has been advised by the hospital that arrangements are being made to reimburse the person in respect of these charges.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	982	The health and children allocation of national lottery funds for 2004 is €13.017 million. This includes €2.539 million which forms part of the funding for the capital programme. The remaining €10.478 million includes funding of €6.847 million which is allocated to health agencies to fund the respite care grants scheme, the disadvantaged youth scheme and the schemes of grants to voluntary organisations and the remaining €3.631 million is discretionary funding available to my Department.The conditions which apply to the allocation by health boards of the scheme of grants to voluntary organisation funds are as follows: grants may be allocated to community based projects under the headings of intellectual and physical disability, services for older people, mental health services, child care services, personal social services, including information and counselling services; at least 70% of the funding should be allocated to local voluntary groups; grants should not be in substitution for section 65 grants; and particular care should be taken to ensure that grants are made to viable schemes which will be completed within a reasonable period and, in determining the priority of schemes, an assessment should be made of any ongoing revenue implications.The amount of discretionary funding available to my Department for 2004 from the proceeds of the national lottery is €3.631 million. There is a set protocol in place in my Department for dealing with applications/requests for grants from discretionary national lottery funds. An application form is made available to any individual, group or agency which requests a grant. Requests for application forms come primarily from individuals, groups and organisations with an involvement in the provision of health services to specific client groups, national groups providing information and support regarding disability and illness and groups with a specific interest. When the completed application form is received in my Department it is registered in the finance unit and forwarded to the relevant services division for their assessment, evaluation and recommendation. All applications are then considered in the context of the recommendation and the overall level of funds available to me.Applications for national lottery grants far exceed the resources available in any one year. Where an application has been unsuccessful, the applicant is informed and advised that they may apply in the following year if funding is required for the particular project.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	984	With regard to the provision of health centres generally, the position is that the identification, prioritisation and provision of such facilities to meet the needs of local communities within its functional area, is a matter for the relevant health board or the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA). In the case of Millbrook Lawns Health Centre, Tallaght, Dublin 24, this responsibility rests with the ERHA.The ERHA has indicated that the refurbishment of this health centre would constitute a regional priority. The ERHA has recently submitted proposals to my Department in relation to the funding of a number of priority projects, including Millbrook Lawns health centre and these proposals are currently being examined by my Department.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	985	My Department meets representatives of the medical education and training organisations and of the Medical Council on an ongoing basis to discuss a very wide range of issues of mutual interest, including the implementation of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD). These meetings, both formal and informal, are very helpful in informing my Department's approach to many issues, including the training of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) in the context of implementing the directive. Over the past number of years both the training bodies and the Medical Council have made a significant contribution to Government policy on medical education and training and on implementing the EWTD, most notably their membership of and contribution to the preparation and publication of the Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing, Hanly report.As you will be aware, on publication of the Hanly report, I asked the sub-group of the Hanly task force which dealt with medical education and training issues to remain in place in order to examine and report to me on the measures required to accommodate NCHD training in all postgraduate programmes and to safeguard training and service delivery during the transition to a 48 hour working week. The group convened a major national seminar last January involving all stakeholders including training bodies, the Medical Council, employers and medical representative organisations. Drawing on the views expressed at this seminar and the ongoing work of the medical education and training group, draft proposals have been developed with a view to ensuring the provision of high quality training for NCHDs in the context of the initial implementation of the 58 hour week and the eventual implementation of the 48-hour working week. I anticipate that these proposals will be submitted to me in the near future.Unfortunately, in recent months, it has been necessary to cancel a number of formal meetings of the medical education and training group due to continuing industrial relations action by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association arising from an unrelated issue. I would like to take this opportunity to again call on all concerned to re-enter formal discussions in the interests of ensuring that both patient care and training needs are fully met in the context of implementation of the directive.Even though it has proved difficult to convene formal meetings of the MET group, the ongoing contacts with training bodies have facilitated the group's secretariat in making progress on a range of issues including, in particular, the draft proposals referred to above on addressing training needs in a 58 hour week. A significant and welcome development has been the forging of constructive dialogue between key medical training and employer representatives in order to jointly address how best to respond to the requirements arising from the implementation of the 58 hour week.The deadlines imposed by the EWTD will be difficult to meet, assuming the full cooperation of the key stakeholders concerned. I again call on the stakeholders concerned to participate with and cooperate with the necessary implementation processes. I think it is important to state that we face the same hurdles as many of our EU colleagues. They too are grappling with how to provide top quality health services while complying with the requirements of the directive. Every effort has been made and continues to be made to achieve compliance. The current difficulties in no way alleviate our legal obligations and only serve to emphasise the growing urgency of making the necessary progress to achieve implementation. I again call on all interested parties to play their part in achieving a healthier and safer working environment for doctors in training and equally important, the safer provision of services to patients.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	986	I welcome the submission prepared by general practitioners working in the region of Mallow General Hospital. The submission rightly identifies an important role for the hospital in the future, and points to the valuable contribution it has made to the community for many years. I am committed to ensuring that Mallow General Hospital will be part of an integrated network of hospitals, providing the highest quality treatment and care for patients.The general practitioners' submission expresses concerns about the perceived consequences of the Hanly report for the population served by Mallow General Hospital. It argues that Hanly would reduce patient access to emergency services within the important "golden hour". However, Hanly argues that the critical issue is speedy access to emergency treatment at the scene by first responders, such as trained ambulance personnel or general practitioners. This should be followed by rapid transfer to a hospital most able to meet their needs. This approach would make access to emergency services within the "golden hour" possible for a greater number of patients than reliance on the location of any individual hospital.It is important to emphasise that the second phase of the Hanly process will examine every acute hospital, including Mallow General Hospital, before recommendations about services are formulated. The concern will be to ensure the best possible service for patients, taking account of geographic, demographic and spatial considerations. I have no doubt that the future of Mallow General Hospital as a vital element of health care will be secured in this context.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	989	Responsibility for the provision of health services to persons residing in counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to her directly.The Deputy may wish to note that persons presenting with eating disorders are generally treated through the psychiatric services of their local health board. Outpatient psychiatric services are provided from a network of hospitals, health centres, day hospitals and day centres. Where in-patient treatment is deemed necessary, it is provided in the local acute psychiatric unit or hospital, beds being allocated on the basis of patient need at any particular time.A tertiary referral service for eating disorders is available to public patients in St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, where three in-patient beds are designated for this purpose. A similar service is available privately at St. Patrick's Hospital, James's Street, Dublin, and at St. John of God Hospital, Stillorgan, County Dublin.Later this year, the Working Group on Child and Adolescent Psychiatry will commence the preparation of a report on services for people with eating disorders and how they can best be developed in the short, medium and long term.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	990	The question of progressing the Dingle Community Hospital to construction is at present being considered by my Department in the context of finalising the capital investment framework 2004-08 for the health service. This will determine what new capital commitments can be progressed in 2004 or beyond, in line with overall funding resources available for the years in question. While it is not possible to give a precise date at this stage in relation to a construction date for this project, I expect this to be finalised shortly. My Department will continue to liaise with the Southern Health Board on the matter and I will ask that the Deputy be kept advised of developments.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	991	Reports of the national cancer registry have examined variations in incidence of cancer among counties and health board areas during the period from 1994 onwards. Variations in case numbers, overall or for particular cancers, obviously reflect variation in population size or in population age structure. Age-standardised rates show less variation, but nevertheless some variation is evident, although, for most counties or health authority areas, rates do not show statistically significant variation from the national average. The main exception is Dublin and the ERHA region, where incidence rates are higher than the national average for cancers as a whole, and for a number of individual cancers, including lung, breast and prostate cancers. For lung and a number of other cancers, variation is strongly influenced by smoking, which tends to be most prevalent in urban, particularly deprived urban, areas. For breast and prostate cancer, incidence rates may be increased in areas where there are higher levels of screening, e.g. breast screening. In general, cancers not strongly influenced by smoking, socio-economic or screening-related factors show less marked variation within Ireland, and any such variation cannot readily be attributed to specific factors without further research into specific cancers. Distinguishing true geographic variation from random or chance variation is also a problem given the small numbers of cases involved at county level for most cancers.Since 1997, significant developments in cancer services have taken place in all regions. The overall additional cumulative funding in cancer services in this country since 1997 is in excess of €550 million including an additional €15 million revenue which I allocated this year. An additional 92 consultant posts in key areas of cancer treatment and 245 clinical nurse specialists across all health board areas have been funded. There has also been approximately €95 million in capital funding allocated specifically for the development of cancer related initiatives. These include an investment of €60 million in radiation oncology, and €11.9 million in BreastCheck.The investment and appointments in cancer services have resulted in substantial increases in activity levels across the three modalities of care of radiation oncology, medical oncology and surgical oncology. For example, since 1996 the annual number of discharges of patients receiving chemotherapy has more than doubled, from 22,000 in 1996 to over 50,000 in 2002. Similarly, for radiotherapy the increase in discharges reported at Cork University Hospital increased from less than 7,000 cases in 1996 to nearly 15,000 in 2002. There has been a 36% increase nationally in surgical procedures for breast cancer, with an additional 500 procedures performed in 2002 compared to 1997.Last year I announced the extension of the BreastCheck programme to counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford and also the national roll out to the southern and western counties. Screening commenced in Wexford in March of this year.The report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland provides the basis of Government policy in relation to the development and organisation of radiation oncology services. This report, which was developed by an expert working group under the chairmanship of Professor Donal Hollywood has received considerable international endorsement. The first phase of this programme will be the development of a network of large clinical centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway which will permit a rapid increase in patient access and also form a backbone for future service expansion.Already, substantial progress is being made in implementing the report's recommendations. In 2004, an additional €3.5 million is being used to develop the services at the supra regional centres at University College Hospital, Galway, and Cork University Hospital. The immediate developments in the south and west will result in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. This represents an increase of approximately 50% in linear accelerator capacity. I have provided for the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists. Recruitment for these posts is under way. We currently have ten consultant radiation oncologists nationally. This will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology in the short term.In relation to other areas of cancer services, significant work is also being undertaken. Under the Ireland-Northern Ireland-NCI Cancer Consortium, awards to the value of €3.5 million are enabling Irish hospitals develop their infrastructure to enable them to carry out high quality clinical trials. Irish hospitals will be able to participate in world-class clinical trials involving the latest advances, helping to ensure that these new and effective treatments are available more readily to patients as a result of this funding.The new national cancer strategy will target investment for cancer services over the next number of years and will make recommendations in relation to the development and organisation of services nationally. The strategy will also provide a mechanism for the development, implementation, monitoring and updating of clinical guidelines for the treatment of cancer.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	992	The primary care strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, aims to shift the emphasis from the current over-reliance on acute hospital services to one where patients will be able to access an integrated multidisciplinary team of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and social workers in their local community. Appropriately structured, primary care can meet 90%-95% of all health and personal social service needs.The strategy also envisages the development of extended-hours and out-of-hours cover for defined primary care services. The management of this wide range of care within the primary care setting represents the most appropriate, effective and user-friendly approach to the organisation of service delivery.Primary care, planned and organised on this basis, can lessen the current reliance on specialist services and the hospital system, particularly accident and emergency and out-patient services. Based on available evidence, it has the potential to reduce the requirement for specialist services, reduce hospitalisation rates, reduce lengths of stay for those who are hospitalised, promote more rational prescribing and improve efficiency.The primary care strategy also recognises that the provision of modern, well-equipped, accessible premises will be central to the effective functioning of the primary care team. One of the Government's key objectives is to facilitate and encourage the development, where appropriate, of modern, well-equipped, user-friendly buildings in which the broad range of primary care services, including general practice, can be delivered. The strategy also emphasises the need to gain full benefit from existing buildings and to fully exploit any opportunities for public private partnerships in implementing the development programme. I am committed to developing policy in such a way as to maximise the opportunities to attract private sector interests into the provision of facilities to support delivery of primary care service in accordance with the new interdisciplinary model.The identification, prioritisation and provision of health centres, including the upgrading of such facilities, to meet the health and personal social service needs of local communities are matters for the health boards or the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	993	I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 and 207 together.The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards/authority in the first instance.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on the of December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.Orthodontic initiative funding of €4.698 million was provided to the health boards/authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards/authority specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.The information requested by the Deputy on the number of patients who have had to seek private treatment in the past five years is not available.Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards/authority have informed my Department that at the end of the March quarter 2004, there were 21,033 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are nearly twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated and almost 4,000 extra children are getting treatment from health boards/authority since the end of 2001.

The taxi hardship panel was an independent three person panel established to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi licensing regime. The panel received and considered over 2,000 written submissions.The report of the panel recommended the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation. The payments range from €3,000 to €15,000 depending on the category of hardship involved.The only category in which the panel recommended hardship payments related to loans was category five which concerns large loan repayments outstanding on loans obtained to purchase a taxi licence and secured against a family home.Area Development Management Limited, ADM, has been engaged to administer and manage the implementation of the taxi hardship payments scheme and I am satisfied that it is operating the scheme in line with the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report and the general and specific requirements for each category as outlined in the application form, which was the subject of consultation with taxi industry representatives.

Through more focused commercial operation, all three airports can perform better and each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional and national economic activity to the benefit of their customers, both airlines and passengers, and of Irish tourism, trade and industry. I have also given repeated assurances to ICTU and the Aer Rianta unions that there will not be any diminution in the terms and conditions of employment of workers in the company on transfer to the new independent airport authorities.The Government has approved the publication of the State Airports Bill 2004 to give effect to the restructuring of Aer Rianta and the Bill has been circulated to Deputies today. It remains my intention that this Bill can be enacted before the summer recess.With regard to the provision of a second terminal at Dublin Airport, passenger traffic through Dublin Airport is expected to grow from last year's level of almost 16 million passengers to 30 million by around 2020. New infrastructure capacity and facilities, both airside and landside, will be needed to cater for this growth including further terminal capacity. With regard to the latter, the programme for Government includes a commitment to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at the airport and to progress such proposals if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits. The question currently at issue, therefore, is not whether new terminal capacity should be provided at Dublin Airport but rather who should provide the next tranche of capacity, the authority responsible for the airport as a whole or the private sector.As the Deputy is aware, the report of last year by the panel of experts chaired by Mr. Paddy Mullarkey concluded that an independent terminal at Dublin Airport would be operationally and technically feasible and that such a terminal is a viable strategic option for the airport. I continue to give urgent attention to the independent terminal concept and I will bring proposals in the matter to the Government very shortly.

It is my intention to proceed to implement these proposals in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government.I have no plans to privatise any of the three CIE operating companies. Instead, I propose to dissolve CIE and establish Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann as independent commercial State companies with strong commercially focused boards. I am convinced that the changes needed to achieve this objective can be obtained in a way which respects the legitimate interests of public transport workers.The overall aim of my reform proposals and investment programme is to deliver more and better quality public transport at reasonable cost to the user and in a way that demonstrates value for money for the tax payer.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	1004	I set out my policy proposals for public transport reform in statements to the public transport partnership forum in November 2002 and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport in June 2003. The principal elements of my proposals are the establishment of an independent procurement and regulatory authority for transport, on a national basis, and the introduction of controlled competition into the bus market in the Dublin area in the form of franchising as the primary means of procuring bus services. I have no plans to privatise Dublin Bus.I am firmly of the view that franchising is the most effective means of achieving genuine market opening in the Dublin market. International experience in cities such as London, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki is that franchising brings cost savings to public transport provision, savings which can be invested in the public transport system to ensure a better service to public transport users. A number of major studies carried out by independent consultants have supported this, including the ISOTOPE report carried out for the European Commission which found that franchising generally resulted in savings of between 15% and 20% of the cost to the State of the provision of bus services; and the NERA-Tis report commissioned by the public transport partnership forum which recommended franchising for the Dublin bus market. Franchising will allow for genuine market opening, with operators other than the existing State owned companies having a role to play in the delivery of services.While recent public discussion on public transport reform has focused almost exclusively on organisational issues and public monopoly provider concerns, the focus of my reforms is primarily on delivering a better service to the customer and greater value for money to the taxpayer. It remains my intention to proceed with legislation on public transport reform in 2004.

Significant progress is being made in delivering a sustainable, safe, appropriately regulated and integrated transport system.This is being achieved through delivering major programmes of investment to increase the capacity of our public transport system, adoption of measures to reform the sector to achieve greater efficiency and value for money and measures to integrate all of these activities.Under the national development plan, the capacity of our mainline and suburban rail system has been significantly expanded, the capacity of the bus fleets of Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus has been renewed and expanded significantly, the Luas system will become operational next week, and increased priority is being offered to buses through an expanded quality bus corridor network in Dublin and in other urban areas. Greater facility for interchanging between modes of public transport will be possible with the coming into service of Luas which connects Connolly Station, Busarus and Heuston Station while smart cards are being introduced to facilitate integrated ticketing.These developments, together with my proposals to reform public transport over the coming period involving the establishment of an independent regulatory process, will I believe introduce a more integrated and efficient public transport system than we have seen previously, with greater travel options and choice available to the consumer. My proposals to establish an independent regulator for public transport will ensure continued co-ordination and integration in public transport.

The present position in this regard is outlined in the reply of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to a parliamentary question answered on Tuesday, 17 February, 2004.

First, the delayed departure of the train was caused by a points failure which occurred at Connolly Station. In addition, a technical problem occurred with the air-conditioning units on some of the individual carriages of this particular train, which compounded the discomfort experienced by Iarnród Éireann's customers on the delayed train on this particularly hot day.Iarnród Éireann is conducting a full examination of all of the newly-acquired diesel railcars over the next few days to ensure that there is no recurrence of the problem. It apologised to its customers for the delays that evening and is working to ensure that such occurrences are avoided in the future.

The group in question was awarded capital grant assistance of more than €1.7 million in February 2002 under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000 — 2006. This funding enabled the group to construct a purpose built childcare facility. In addition, in October 2001, the group received a grant towards its staffing costs amounting to €361,875 over three years. It is now seeking further capital funding of about €250,000 for the purchase of equipment for the new service.The day-to-day administration of the EOCP is undertaken by ADM Limited, which has been engaged by my Department to carry out thorough assessments against the programme criteria of all applications for grant assistance under the programme, on my behalf. On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, which makes a funding recommendation to me before I make a final decision on the matter. I understand that this grant application is in the final stages of assessment and a decision will be made shortly. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this application for additional capital grant assistance.

For the purpose of clarity the factual position is as follows. No Irish Government has ever negotiated or agreed compassionate parole criteria with any group of prisoners or with representatives or emissaries acting on behalf of any group of prisoners. It is vital to stress that there has never been any automatic entitlement to temporary release for any prisoner for any reason, regardless of whether he or she belongs to a particular grouping of prisoners. The facts of the matter are that each application for temporary release on compassionate grounds is judged on its merits.I am at a loss as to what the Deputy means by the phrase "autonomous republic prisoners unit". There are no autonomous units within Irish prisons. All prisons and places of detention managed by the Irish Prison Service are subject to the rules for the government of prisons.

There are also some smaller niche systems, including support systems, in use in the force. Access to Garda IT systems and data are limited to those members of the Garda Síochána and civilian personnel who require access to discharge their particular duties.The operation of the PULSE system has provided the Garda Síochána with unprecedented support in its operational and strategic roles. PULSE provides a co-ordinated system which replaced a range of older computer and paper-based systems to enable on-line access to information thereby maximising its use throughout the Garda organisation. The final release of the system has been rolled out to the Garda organisation over recent months and is now complete. This release provides new functionality in a number of areas, including warrants, driver licence and insurance production, bail sign-on, electoral register, crime victim notifications and domestic violence orders.It is to be expected that there will be intermittent technical challenges to be addressed and resolved in an IT enabled change initiative on the scale of PULSE. That said, I am informed by the Garda authorities that nearly all the performance targets for the system have been met and that further improvements can be expected when a technology upgrade takes place later this year.

He subsequently applied for permission to remain on the basis of parentage of a child born in the State on 29 October 1999. This permission was granted in October 2000.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L&O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish-born child ended on 19 February 2003.

In November 2002, due to ongoing difficulties with the management of the project, my Department directed that the group suspend activity pending a review to be carried out by the independent technical support service responsible for the management of the measure.The technical support service submitted its report to my Department in December 2002. Having considered the report, I decided in March 2003 to scale back the group's original proposal to a budget of €51,883 for delivery within a six-month period.Following discussions between my Department and the project promoters, a revised action plan was drawn up by the group and a supplementary agreement was signed by both parties, effective from 16 June 2003. The project concluded its activity on 15 December 2003 and a final report was submitted by the group in March 2004.

Persons who are not members of a political party may enter on the nomination paper the expression "Non-Party" or may leave the space on a ballot paper blank. Current legislation is based on the premise that the expression "Non-Party" indicates adequately that a person does not belong to a political party, and any change in this matter would require an amendment of the legislation.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	1033	As part of the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness, local authorities, together with health boards and other statutory and voluntary bodies, were required to draw up local action plans to tackle homelessness in their areas. With regard to the action plan for Cork city, the plan for 2001-03 has been completed and I understand that the plan for 2004-06 is at present being finalised by the relevant agencies.The Government is committed to continuing to support local statutory and voluntary bodies in tackling the issue of homelessness. I am satisfied that significant progress has been made in addressing the issue in Cork since the publication of the homeless strategies. My Department's provision for the recoupment to local authorities of 90% of the cost of providing accommodation and related services for homeless persons in 2004 is €51 million. This brings to €190.6 million the total provided for this purpose since 2000. Further funding is provided by the local authorities and, in the case of care related services, by the health boards. In 2003, the Simon Community in Cork received €861,300 for its accommodation related homeless services and I understand, €780,000 from the Southern Health Board for the care related costs of its projects.Should the Cork Simon Community wish to seek additional funding for an extension of its activities under its community plan 2004-07, the application should, in the first instance, be made to the local statutory authorities. It is vital that all applications and proposals are considered and routed through the Cork City Homeless Forum to ensure that they are consistent with the homeless action plan, that optimum use is made of available funding and to avoid unnecessary duplication of services.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	1034	My Department recoups to local authorities 90% of expenditure incurred in the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons. It was not considered appropriate to initiate a system of multi-annual funding for this sector in view of the initial difficulties in establishing baseline expenditure figures when the integrated strategy on homelessness was launched in 2000. Since then, the requirements for these services have been assessed on an annual basis and funding has been allocated accordingly. This has resulted in funding for accommodation and related services increasing substantially from €12.5 million in 1999 to €50 million in 2003. This year, €51 million has been allocated for this purpose. This has ensured continued and sustained funding at local authority level of existing projects in addition to the establishment of new projects.The need for greater security of funding on the part of service providers is, however, acknowledged and among the initiatives being taken in this context is the establishment, in the Dublin area, of a system of three-year contracts between the statutory and voluntary agencies. The possibility of introducing a similar system will be pursued with other local authorities and the issue of multi-annual funding will be kept under continuing review.

In order to vote, a person's name must be entered on the register for the locality in which the person ordinarily resides and the person's citizenship determines the polls at which he or she is entitled to vote. Irish citizens may vote at all polls, British citizens may vote at Dáil, European and local elections EU citizens, other than Irish and UK citizens, may vote at European and local elections and non-EU citizens may vote at local elections only. Electors are entered on the register according to their eligibility to vote based on information furnished by them to the registration authority; Irish citizens are shown on the register with no letter after their names; UK citizens have D after their names; EU citizens an E; and non-EU citizens have L after their names.Members of the public are encouraged to examine the draft register of electors, which is published on 1 November annually, to ensure that their details are correctly entered on the register and to request their registration authority to rectify any errors, including inaccuracies in their voting entitlements. If a person is not included in the register, he or she may apply for entry in a supplement to the register which is published prior to polling day at each election and referendum. It would not be feasible to provide for a correction facility on polling day given the principal need to ensure the smooth running of the poll or polls. The compilation and maintenance of the register of elections is the responsibility of the registration authority while the responsibility for conducting a poll or polls rests with the relevant returning officer. Responsibility for ensuring that one's details are correctly entered in the register of electors rests with the individual.

Nevertheless, inconsistencies in the availability of waivers and related issues connected with waste charges have been brought to my attention in discussions with the social partners in the context of the Sustaining Progress special initiatives. I have indicated that the matter would be given further consideration, in conjunction with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and an examination of the issues involved is now under way.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	1039	There has been regular contact between my Department and local authorities in relation to their functions under the regulations applying to the private rented sector. Local authorities have been urged in this connection to be proactive in carrying out their statutory obligation to enforce the regulations.The current level of compliance by landlords with the registration regulations is low. This is evidenced by the fact that on 31 December 2003 there were 26,982 units registered by 17,445 landlords with local authorities, whereas the 2002 census indicates that there are 141,459 private rented dwellings in the State. I am confident that there will be a very significant improvement in enforcement under the new tenancy registration system provided for in the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003.When the Private Residential Tenancies Bill is enacted, the 1996 registration regulations will be repealed and landlords will be required to register details of their tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, which will proactively pursue compliance. One way in which unregistered accommodation will come to the attention of the board will be if the tenants refer disputes pertaining to such tenancies to the board. Unlike tenants, landlords must be registered to avail of the board's dispute resolution service.A double fee will apply to late registrations and penalties for convictions for non-registration are being increased. Conviction for an offence under the legislation, including contravention of the registration requirements, will carry a fine of up to €3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both, along with a daily fine, of up to €250 for continuing non-compliance.

The schemes included in the programme are derived from the priorities identified by South Dublin County Council in response to my Department's request to all local authorities last year to undertake a fresh assessment of the need for capital water services works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. As proposals for the Brittas area were not put forward in this context, the investment programme does not include a rebate for this area.

It is a matter for the county council to identify the individual locations for the construction-acquisition of housing on the basis of the particular needs of an area. It is the case that the council proposes to start in excess of 500 housing starts in its area in 2004. Officials of my Department are in regular contact with the authority in relation to its housing programme.Since 2000 local authorities have operated their housing construction programmes on the basis of a four year multi-annual programme of house starts for the period 2000-03. A new multi-annual programme is now being introduced for the period 2004-06 in the context of the preparation of action plans for social and affordable housing by local authorities. I consider that the preparation of these action plans will be beneficial to local authorities in identifying priorities over the coming years for the provision of local authority houses in areas where there are identified needs.

The relevant technical guidance document, TGD, H — Drainage and Waste Water Disposal — calls up the following standards: septic tanks serving single houses — Irish standard recommendations SR6 of 1991 for domestic effluent treatment and disposal from single dwellings, issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI; and septic tanks serving groups of houses — British standard BS 6297: 1983, incorporating amendment No. 1 of 1990, a code of practice for the design and installation of small sewage treatment works, issued by the British Standards Institution, BSI.The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is developing a revised manual on wastewater treatment systems serving single houses. It is understood that the EPA manual will supersede SR6: 1991, which will be withdrawn by the NSAI. My Department plans to amend TGD-H to call up the EPA manual as soon as it is published.Primary responsibility for protecting water against pollution caused by discharges from a septic tank rests with the owner and operator of a septic tank. The Water Services Bill will impose a duty of care on occupiers-owners of premises to ensure that septic tanks are kept so as not to cause nuisance or risk to human health or the environment.Under the Local Government (Water) Pollution Acts, it is an offence for a person to cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters directly or indirectly. Enforcement of this legislation is a matter for the relevant local authority.

The centre has an annual income in excess of €600,000, not including the recent commitment of €150,000 from the Department of Health and Children, mainly coming from State sources.The buildings used by the Carmichael Centre are provided rent and rates-free by the State to that organisation. The member groups or tenants of the Carmichael Centre enjoy rent-free accommodation in the buildings.The demand from the centre that the State provide €300,000 per annum in core-funding appears to arise from the need to replace funds from philanthropic sources which ceased in September 2003. That such funding was finite and would cease on a given date could not have come as a surprise to the centre. Many organisations in the sector receive such funding from time to time but do not operate with a built-in assumption that the State will replace it when it runs out. State resources are limited and organisations in every sector must present a solid case for State support built on sound argument and prudent management. The Carmichael Centre must be subject to a critical appraisal of its activities in order that its income and expenditure be brought into a more realistic balance.In consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, I will shortly invite representatives of the Carmichael Centre to discussions on this matter. We will be prepared, if necessary, to look at alternative arrangements to allow the buildings to continue to be available to the sector.The Government will not allow the closure of the buildings as a resource for the sector and they will continue to be made available by the State to accommodate voluntary groups and organisations. Community employment/social economy jobs will continue to be an integral part of any future arrangements.Funding provided by my Department to Carmichael Centre in 2003 was as follows: €75,000 to assist the centre with ongoing costs; and €5,500 under the scheme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations in respect of refurbishment costs at the centre. In addition, an allocation of €120,000 —€40,000 per annum over three years — was approved in 2003 under the scheme of training and supports for the community and voluntary sector. The first tranche of €40,000 was paid earlier this year.

In the first instance there are many small-scale proposals from RAPID plans that could be dealt with more effectively at local level. In light of this, I have introduced a new delivery mechanism, supported by a dedicated fund of €4.5 million in 2004, to progress these proposals. These proposals will be co-funded by the relevant Department or local agency under a number of categories, with broad levels of funding agreed at national level.A total of €2 million is being provided for the local authority housing estate enhancement scheme. This scheme will be operated by local authorities and will be funded on a euro by euro basis —€1 million from my Department and €1 million from the local authorities through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Each of the three RAPID areas in Tallaght received a total allocation of €60,000 under this scheme.Funding of €3 million is being provided for the current year to support the development of playgrounds in RAPID areas, €1.5 million from my Department and €1.5 million from the Department of Health and Children. Each of the three RAPID areas in Tallaght received a total allocation of €72,000 under this scheme. For both of these schemes, the local authority, in consultation with the relevant area implementation team, AIT, will select projects to be supported.I expect to announce the details of top-up funding under the sports capital programme shortly. A total of €1.5 million has been set aside to top-up funding for successful projects from RAPID areas under this programme.As regards the larger projects from RAPID plans that have already been submitted to Departments, these will continue to be considered for funding within existing funding streams in each Department. However, I expect that Departments will now be dealing with a smaller number of projects and will therefore be in a better position to prioritise projects and set out timescales for further actions. Work on improving integration and co-ordination of service delivery at local level will continue as this is a key component of the RAPID programme.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-22 00:00:00	Prelude	1056	I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 290 together.The report in question examined my Department's existing fraud and abuse control activity, and the extent to which that activity is related to an assessment of the risks of fraud and error attaching to the different schemes. It also looked at the effectiveness of performance in the control area generally.One of the main lessons emerging from the report is the need for control activity to be based on a risk assessment and risk management approach and this is an area which my Department will be progressing in the period ahead. This approach was also recommended in the report of a working group on the accountability of Secretaries General and accounting officers published in 2003.The Comptroller and Auditor General's report acknowledges the emphasis which my Department's revised control strategy places on risk analysis of schemes to identify and prioritise areas of the highest risk of fraud and abuse. The risk analysis process commenced in late 2003 and action plans are currently being prepared in the light of the findings.As part of the review and in consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General's office my Department carried out a survey of the unemployment and one-parent family payment schemes in an attempt to assess underlying levels of fraud and error. Surveys of this kind will in future form an integral part of my Department's control strategy, with one such survey having commenced in May 2004 in one scheme area and a further two planned for later this year.The report also includes an examination of detected overpayments and found that fraud accounted for 48% of all overpayments detected. The report emphasises that analysis of detected overpayments and their cause is a valuable pointer to areas where action needs to be taken either to implement new controls or modify existing procedures so as to reduce the level and value of overpayments occurring.Currently, plans are being put in place for a new computerised central overpayments and debt management system within my Department. When fully operational, this will provide a facility to enhance the targeting of control work, make overpayment recovery more effective and provide better and more up-to-date information on the main types of fraud and error occurring within schemes.The report also emphasises the use of prosecutions as a deterrent against fraud. The Department's policy is to consider all cases of fraud and abuse for prosecution and revised prosecution guidelines issued to staff in February 2003. In this regard, 482 cases were sent to the Central Prosecutions Service within my Department in 2003 and of these 405 have been referred for prosecution.The report also suggests that in addition to prosecutions, it may be worth considering a greater array of sanctions such as administrative penalties. My Department has already done some work in this area and is in consultation with the Attorney General's office in the matter.Overall the Comptroller and Auditor General's report has provided a very worthwhile assessment of control activity in the Department and raised a number of issues which will be taken on board in the context of implementing my Department's control strategy. In 2003, my Department realised total savings of €306.16 million in combating fraud and abuse involving 320,000 claim reviews and 7,600 employer inspections.

As the Deputy will be aware, the number of people claiming asylum in Ireland has fallen sharply over the last year and a half.Furthermore, asylum seekers who are granted refugee status or humanitarian leave to remain in the State may qualify for child benefit as they are regarded as satisfying the habitual residence condition on being granted either refugee status or humanitarian leave to remain.

The person concerned is not currently in receipt of a payment from my Department, or of rent supplement and he is not entitled to payment of back to education allowance under the rules of this scheme. As his means have not been reviewed for some time, however, I have arranged for his circumstances to be examined to establish whether he would now be entitled to a payment from my Department which would count for qualification for back to education allowance.
