#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	The commission of investigation led by Mr. Justice O'Higgins was established to determine the veracity of very serious allegations of Garda malpractice made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe. Its establishment followed a long saga of harassment, poor treatment and attacks on the bona fides of Sergeant McCabe. When it emerged, following the conclusion of the commission of investigation, that the legal representative of the former Garda Commissioner was instructed to attack the motivation and integrity of Sergeant McCabe, people felt genuine shock and anger. That was not how it was meant to be. The O'Higgins inquiry was meant to be a new chapter in the way in which the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe were to be treated as well as in the way he was treated as a person. It was supposed to find out the facts of what happened and it was never meant to be an adversarial attack on his credibility and integrity as a person. We have now learned in various reports over the last number of days that the head of Garda HR was told "We are going to go after Maurice at the commission". It is also reported that a telephone call was made on 15 May from the former Commissioner to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality on the proposed legal strategy. To be fair, Deputy Alan Kelly has tabled a number of parliamentary questions on this issue of the extent of consultation between the Department and the former Garda Commissioner, the extent and content of meetings and communications, if any, between the Department's officials and the former Commissioner and whether complaints were made to the Department about the legal strategy adopted and how it was adopted. In the normal course, questions like these should receive straightforward answers. The answer from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is classic in the sense that he answered a question which he was not asked and failed to answer the questions he was asked by Deputy Kelly. Deputy Kelly has followed up with further questions which are very serious in nature and to which the answers will be serious too. In the context of a Parliament like this, it is very strange that replies are not being given. In an interview at the weekend, the Tánaiste refused to confirm or deny whether she was aware of this adversarial approach being taken at the O'Higgins commission. The Taoiseach said at the weekend that he would speak to the two Ministers. Has he spoken to the two Ministers, what has been their response, and can the Taoiseach bring clarity to this issue? Did the Tánaiste know about the attack on the integrity and credibility of Sergeant McCabe as per the legal strategy of the former Garda Commissioner?

That is why we established a commission of investigation in the first place and a tribunal thereafter. I assure the Deputy that those of us here on the Government benches want to know, as much as anyone in the House, the full facts as to what happened here, why Maurice McCabe was treated as he was and whether there was a campaign of vilification led against him by senior gardaí or anyone else. To answer the Deputy's question, I spoke to the Tánaiste yesterday. She is currently in the United Arab Emirates on a trade mission. She confirmed to me that she had no hand, act or part in forming the former Commissioner's legal strategy, nor did she have any prior knowledge of the legal strategy the former Commissioner's team pursued. She found out about it after the fact, but around the time it was in the public domain when everyone else knew about it as well. The current Minister for Justice and Equality was not a Minister in the Department at the time and he also had no hand, act or part in, or prior knowledge of, the legal strategy being pursued by the former Commissioner's legal team.The Department of Justice and Equality is a big place with many different people in it but, as things stand, the Department has not been able to find any record of being informed before the fact of the legal strategy the Commissioner was going to pursue. It was told about the approach taken by the Commissioner's senior counsel but that was after the cross-examination had taken place. The Department was not in a position, after the fact, to express concerns about it or counsel against it. The Deputy claims there was a call to the Secretary General on the day of the cross-examination but we have not been able to confirm if that is or is not the case. I think that perhaps it is not and that the assertion may be false but I do not want to swear to it today or until I can find out for certain. There may well have been a telephone call from the Commissioner's office to the Department on the day but it is not unusual for the Commissioner's office to contact the Department of Justice and Equality. The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, had no hand, act or part in the legal strategy and had no prior knowledge of it. She and the Department only found out about it after the cross-examination had already taken place.

It has taken quite a long time for us to ascertain that the Tánaiste did not have prior knowledge of the legal strategy. In the context of the commitment to establishing the truth about the engagement between the Department of Justice and Equality and the legal representatives or the Garda Commissioner, has the Department submitted all its documentation details of all the contacts between it and the former Garda Commissioner to the Charleton inquiry? The Taoiseach said the Government was committed to establishing the truth so I take it material has been sent by the Department to the Charleton inquiry on this specific matter.

I cannot tell the Deputy here today whether it has provided all the information asked for by the tribunal but it certainly will do so. It is important to get the facts straight in relation to the terms of reference of the tribunal. The terms of reference of the tribunal, mandated to consider the questions put forward by Deputy Kelly, include:To investigate contacts between members of An Garda Síochána and:- Media and broadcasting personnel,- members of the Government,- TUSLA,- Health Service Executive,- any other State entities,- or any relevant person as the Sole Member may deem necessary to carry out his work;As the Department of Justice and Equality is a State entity it is covered by this tribunal and will co-operate with it in full. 
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	4	Two reports published this morning confirm what people have known for quite some time, that is, that the Government's housing policy is a catastrophic failure. The overriding message in the reports from Daft.ie and the ESRI is that accommodation has become unaffordable and supply is at an all-time low. As things stand, renting or buying a home is now beyond the reach of an entire generation. Rather than delivering opportunity, the Government's housing crisis has instead delivered extreme stress, depression and hopelessness for thousands of citizens, who work hard and who aspire to a better life but for whom there is very little reward. Ten years ago, a couple would make sacrifices in their daily lives to save for a deposit for a home but today they make exactly the same sacrifices simply to meet the extortionate rent that is due at the end of each month, if they are lucky. Life goals that were once considered modest and common have all been made impossible and people have told me their relationships are cracking under the strain of the housing emergency.For many people in their late 20s to mid 30s even the idea of starting a family now falls into the bracket of unaffordability. These are the very real human consequences for those struggling to get on the property ladder or struggling to pay their rent. This is the reality and we hear it every day. The damage that is being done to people, including to their mental and physical health, is devastating. They spend 40 hours a week at work, and some spend more, but they have precious little to show for it. They cannot build a future and they find themselves in an exhausting economic and psychological dead end. So much for a republic of opportunity. It is nothing but a dupe. I suggest the Taoiseach needs to change track. Instead of trying to normalise homelessness in this State with crude statistical exercises he needs to implement policies that actually work. The Government must increase the supply of affordable housing and introduce measures to reduce the cost of purchasing or renting a home. Just so as the Taoiseach knows, affordable housing means properties at a sale price of between €160,000 to €260,000 in Dublin. This would meet the needs of households earning above the threshold for social housing but below the €75,000 a year mark. It would mean affordable rental tenancies with fair rent. We have repeatedly suggested some solutions that meet these problems. Will the Taoiseach today commit to introducing a new affordable housing scheme that delivers homes on a level that matches the scale of the crisis we face? Rather than throwing renters to the wolf of market forces, will the Taoiseach introduce legislation that delivers real rent certainty by linking increases to the cost of living?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	5	The Deputy is very welcome back. I understand she was on a fundraising trip to the United States last week. I hope that went very well. In terms of the two reports the Deputy mentioned, the daft.ie report and the ESRI report both add to our understanding of this issue and they are both worth a read and worthy of consideration. I had the opportunity on the way in this morning to listen to some experts on housing speak about the two reports on "Morning Ireland". They came from very different perspectives, from daft.ie, the ESRI and the Nevin Institute. They all agreed the fundamental underlying problem is a lack of supply and the fact we do not have enough houses, apartments and homes for a country with a rising population, increasing employment and changing demographics with more people in smaller households. In terms of supply, we are increasing the provision of social housing. Between 2,000 and 3,000 social houses will be completed before the end of the year. This is a significant increase on last year and the year before. This will increase to approximately 4,000 to 5,000 next year. In terms of affordability, we have provided hundreds of millions for the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, to make sites accessible and make it possible for developers to build on them. There is a requirement as part of this that a significant number of the units be affordable. We also announced in the budget the establishment of house building finance Ireland. This will make it much cheaper for builders to get finance. This will take some time to get up and running but will be up and running sometime next year. We have also increased the vacant site levy to punish people who hoard land. At Cabinet today, we decided to make an amendment to the Finance Bill to require the Department of Finance to produce a report on a vacant house tax and how this might work. This will be for the consideration of the Dáil. We have also fast tracked planning and we are changing the building regulations. We are seeing results. Planning permissions are up 49% year on year, commencement notices are up 45% year on year and next year we anticipate somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 new homes being built, which is not enough but is a significant improvement on previous years. The report on rent refers to rents advertised, so it does not cover the rent pressure zones.As a result of the introduction of the rent pressure zones, 60% of renters now have rent certainty and rent control and cannot have their rent increased by more than 4% in any one year. That has given huge relief and security to people who are renting. The scheme has already been extended to Drogheda and parts of County Wicklow and may well be extended again.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	6	Last week, the Taoiseach had neither a definition of "affordable housing" nor any targets for the delivery of affordable homes. At the weekend, he deliberately used an out-of-date OECD report to try to play down the scale of the homelessness crisis we face. He has said that he has read today's reports and that they "add to our understanding of this issue". We would have found it more comforting if he had told us that the reports have illuminated his understanding. Perhaps he just does not want to know. The figures demonstrate the root of our problem. The Taoiseach mentioned that, over three years, €1.1 billion is being dedicated to the help-to-buy scheme, the local infrastructure fund and House Building Finance Ireland. All of those initiatives are directed at private developers. By contrast, a mere €25 million be allocated over the next two years to build houses that are really affordable, such as those on sale in the Poppintree area of Ballymun. People like clerical staff and factory workers who are on average incomes can afford to buy such houses. The Taoiseach has performed an about-face. I have quite deliberately set out for him the human consequences of the catastrophe people are facing. I hear these stories and I am sure he hears them too. I hope they are adding to his understanding and informing his position. Will he dedicate more money to the construction of truly affordable housing? Will he introduce a new scheme that will meet this crisis head-on in real terms? Is he open to that?

Everyone in this House has friends, family members and constituents, hosts constituency clinics and understands the problems being faced by individuals. We all know that homelessness is a stain on our society. We all know that the millions of people who are not directly affected by it are angered by the injustice of it. We understand the wider issue of young people working, saving up and trying to afford to buy their own homes for the first time but not being able to do so. I remind Deputy McDonald, who asked about my definition of "affordable housing", that the definition she uses is from 2011 and was stood down some time ago. The OECD report I quoted was published in 2017.

We will dedicate more resources to the building of affordable housing. The local infrastructure housing activation fund is about making sites accessible so that builders can build affordable homes. The house-building finance initiative is about enabling builders to finance the construction of housing and making it cheaper to build houses so that there can be more affordable homes for more people.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	14	When the commission of investigation which ultimately became the Charleton tribunal was first discussed, Deputy Wallace and I sought to amend its terms of reference to include an investigation into the extent to which the then Minister for Justice and Equality had been briefed about Maurice McCabe. When the disclosures tribunal was established in March of this year, we wrote to Mr. Justice Charleton to ask him to investigate specifically under term of reference [h], which the Taoiseach quoted earlier, contact between An Garda Síochána and staff in the Department of Justice and Equality.Anyone who is surprised that evidence of the involvement of the Department of Justice and Equality exists really has not been paying attention to what has gone on in terms of the crisis of policing in this State in recent years and its roots in the link between An Garda Síochána, the Department and the Minister, a link we sought to break in legislation designed to facilitate proper independent oversight, which, unfortunately, was not supported by the House. The real issue for the Taoiseach is not that the crisis will have a knock-on effect on the Department but rather why that information is being released now through the offices of his former Cabinet colleague, whose party supported Nóirín O'Sullivan 100% - not just in government but in opposition - when revelations in respect of her legal strategy regarding Maurice McCabe had been made. Critically, what is the Taoiseach going to do about this? He has fared pretty well out of Garda controversies but he is now the boss and this is solely a matter for him. He can either choose to be a pawn in the games being played by the warring tribes that exist within An Garda Síochána - with the Department of Justice and Equality mandarins in the background - or he can decide to take decisive action in the context of delivering a modern police service that the citizens and gardaí deserve. Last week, senior Garda officers who attended a pre-retirement course were shocked to see none other than the acting Garda Commissioner amble in and sit down to listen to what was being said. They thought he was at the helm. This is the same acting Garda Commissioner whose report into allegations of Garda involvement in the heroin trade in the Minister for Justice and Equality's constituency has not been published for three and a half years. As a result, GSOC cannot publish its report because it was previously been prevented from attending the disciplinary action involving these gardaí and has been frustrated in trying to access files. How can there be change without accountability or effective oversight and how long is the Taoiseach going to allow this situation to prevail? The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is flopping around on the outskirts coming up with nice jargon about new uniforms and new words. How in God's name will the chaos be stopped when there is nobody at the helm? What other company with 15,000 members of staff would not have a CEO in place? What job takes that long to fill? When is the Taoiseach going to call for the implementation of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate report and the filling of the vacancy for Garda Commissioner?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	15	The process of Garda reform is much very under way. We have an acting Garda Commissioner, whom I met last week. He is not retiring and will be in place until we are in a position to recruit a new Garda Commissioner, which we intend to do as soon as possible. Discussions are under way with the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the Policing Authority to make that happen because it is important that we have a new Garda Commissioner in place sooner rather than later and that this individual will be able to bring in his or her own team. I do not think one person alone can change An Garda Síochána. When I was in Seattle the week before last, I had the opportunity to speak with Kathleen O'Toole who informed me about she reformed and modernised the police service in that city. She told me that it was somewhat similar to what we had in Ireland, with gardaí running IT systems and HR - things that policemen are not really best trained to do - and how important it was that the new Commissioner would be able to bring in his or her own team. It may be worth informing the House that a memorandum was brought to the Cabinet this morning by the Minister for Justice and Equality to give the Policing Authority approval for the first time to appoint a superintendent of An Garda Síochána who is a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI. This is a very practical example of reform that is under way. For the first time, somebody from an outside police force - in this case, an officer from the PSNI - can be appointed to a senior position in An Garda Síochána, so that is an outside appointment to a senior position. I think we will see more of that in the weeks and months ahead. I cannot answer questions on behalf of third parties who are not Members of this House or who formerly served here.Such questions would have to be directed to them. We should be circumspect when commenting on matters that are before a tribunal. As parliamentarians, we need to bear that in mind when making public comment. We need to respect the role of the tribunal, which was established by the Oireachtas earlier this year. All sides of the House supported the establishment of that tribunal and all Members were given an opportunity at that time to contribute to its terms of reference. The Standing Orders of the House, as the Ceann Comhairle will know, preclude Members from raising matters that encroach on the work of the tribunal. 
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	16	We fully respect the work of Mr. Justice Charleton and the record will bear witness to that. We have been in contact with him. There is a crisis of policing in the State. A drowning man or woman will grab on to anyone to try to save him or herself. It could be a senior civil servant or a Minister. The question for the Taoiseach is whether it will be him. The Taoiseach's answer is not the answer he would have given when he was a Minister. The issue at stake is who will seize control. Measures such as the appointment of people from other police services have long been recommended by the Garda Inspectorate. We need the implementation of such measures. The Taoiseach will probably bask in the glory of his new leadership and the benefit it has brought to Fine Gael, which is the same party with the same members but which is perceived differently. Presumably a new leader for An Garda Síochána could be the transforming vehicle it needs because it needs something. What we have now is warring tribes in anticipation of the Charleton tribunal. If the Taoiseach honestly thinks that can continue until the commission on policing decides to give us an answer, possibly in a year's time, then he is more deluded than I gave him credit for previously.

I do not disagree with the analysis she has put forward. I am not sure I would go so far as to say there are warring tribes but I broadly agree with the solutions the Deputy has put forward and the change that needs to happen. I gave the Deputy an example of the change that is happening. For the first time, somebody from outside - a member of the PSNI - has been appointed as superintendent. That was agreed by Cabinet this morning. We also have a civilianisation process under way. The Deputy will be aware that a number of senior posts in the Garda are now being filled by civilians. We have the Policing Authority and the policing commission. We certainly will not be waiting for the policing commission to produce its final report before we recruit a new Garda Commissioner. We need a new Garda Commissioner and we need that person to be able to bring in people from outside the force to modernise and improve it and to bring it up to the standard we expect. It is not fully under the control of the Government. The Policing Authority has a role in it now. It is our intention as a Government to advertise for the position of Garda Commissioner before the end of this calendar year. The Taoiseach: The Deputy is absolutely right.

#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	18	I want to raise concerns regarding the operation of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, which was set up by the House under the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014. Under that Act, €1.24 billion was placed with the SBCI to finance enterprises that provide credit to small and medium-sized enterprises. The SBCI raised €1.24 billion, of which €525 million came from the State. By December 2015, €751 million in total had been approved to lenders by the SBCI, of which €675 million was allocated to AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. Only €235 million was drawn down and of that, only €172 million went into the market. Amazingly, the banks managed to retain €63 million, which improved the liquidity of their balance sheets. By the end of 2016, the banks had increased their retention of this fund to €112 million, which again improved the look of their balance sheets. By the end of 2016, 84% of money given out by the SBCI for so-called investment purposes went towards car leasing, hire purchase and property restructuring. This is asset-backed lending as opposed to what it was meant for, which is working capital lending. The purpose of this type of lending was never envisaged by the Act. According to the 2016 published accounts, which cover two years and four months of SBCI operations, 11% went to working capital and €27 million, or 5%, went to clear off the debt in Ireland of three foreign banks, namely, ACC, Danske Bank and Lloyds Bank of Scotland.Also included in that €27 million was a figure for a further bailout of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society. The main criteria for access to the fund were inconsistent and prohibitive. They set the bar so high that only the banks would be eligible. On closer scrutiny it is now obvious from responses to freedom of information requests that neither the banks nor the five other successful lenders met the qualification criteria as set down by SBCI. Furthermore, the three main banks did not set up a special purpose vehicle, SPV, or produce projections as per the criteria. This resulted in no transparency as to where the money was going and the purpose for which it was used internally in banks. Apart from the three established banks funded by the SBCI, five other private non-banking companies were successful in securing SBCI funds. Of these five, four are only involved in leasing and property finance, and not working capital. Coincidentally two of the new non-banking lenders which received SBCI funding of €91 million are headed up by former senior executives of failed banks. One of these new companies was also handed an equity injection of a further €30 million by the NTMA, which is the parent company of SBCI. From work by various accountants it is now apparent that the majority of companies in receipt of this fund are using the funds to improve the liquidity of their balance sheets as opposed to lending to SMEs. We need to establish if SBCI is operating in contravention to the Acts.

He will appreciate that I am not au fait with the inner workings of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. I will certainly raise the matters the Deputy has raised with the Minister for Finance because it is essential that any public body should operate solely within the legislation passed by this House to provide for it. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has a mandate to deliver access to finance for Irish enterprises, particularly SMEs, to correct failures in the Irish credit market while encouraging competition. The SBCI does not aim to maximise profits but aims to provide cheaper funding on better terms to small business. It began lending in March 2015 and from then until the end of June 2017 the SBCI has lent €855 million to 21,000 Irish companies employing 100,000 people. The average interest rate it offers is 1.15 percentage points lower than the average market interest rate on loans to SMEs. All sectors of the economy benefit from SBCI financing, including manufacturing, agriculture, food, retail, health care, transport and construction. The majority of SBCI loans are used for investment purposes and SMEs supported by the SBCI are based in all regions of the company - some 85% of the lending has been to businesses outside Dublin. It does not lend directly but does so through partner finance providers, known as on-lenders. It currently has three bank and five non-bank lenders. These are AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Merrion Fleet, First Citizen Finance, Finance Ireland, Bibby Financial Services Ireland and FEXCO asset management. Some 23.2% of its funding has gone to the agricultural sector and, as I mentioned, 85% of it is outside Dublin.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	20	There is unease over the lack of transparency of this scheme. There is a strongly held view in financial lending circles of favouritism towards the pillar banks and that the conditions of eligibility to the fund are structured in order to suit the big established players in the market - a view that the existing terms and conditions and format are anti-competitive and have a detrimental impact on those lenders which cannot reach the unrealistic and unobtainable criteria set out in the scheme. In view of the enormous sums of money involved, representatives of the SBCI should be given the opportunity to appear before the appropriate Oireachtas committee to ascertain what oversight, measurement or assessment of the operations of the fund have been conducted by the Department of Finance and to find out what benefit has accrued to the SME sector. What kind of return is evident in terms of stabilising troubled small companies, protecting jobs and enabling growth in job opportunities in the SME sector? We need a review to understand if the SBCI is delivering on its remit generally. Is the State getting value for the expensive administration overheads of the SBCI?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	In terms of the breakdown, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, has committed €881 million to its on-lending partners. The vast bulk of that, €400 million has gone through AIB, followed by Bank of Ireland, €200 million; Ulster Bank, €75 million; Finance Ireland, €51 million; First Citizen, €40 million; Bibby Financial Services, €45 million; and FEXCO, €70 million. It is certainly the case that the bulk of the lending has gone through the very large pillar banks. The Deputy's suggestion that the SBCI appear before the finance committee or another appropriate committee to account for itself and the work it is doing is an appropriate one. I see no reason that should not happen or that it would be unwilling to appear before the finance committee but that is a matter for the Chairman and members of that committee. I know the very thorough work it did around the tracker mortgages. I am sure it could do some good work around this as well.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	24	There seems to be a lot of confusion and some degree of incoherence in respect of what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, described as the bonkers situation of the outstanding pension anomalies whereby 42,000 people lose as much as €1,500 a year as a result of changes that were made back in 2012. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, informed a meeting of the Select Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection - at which she was discussing the forthcoming social welfare Bill - that she recognises the problem and wants to fix it. She said it would be fixed in the short term and that she is going to bring proposals forward fairly quickly. She said she is busy preparing a memorandum for Cabinet. Today, it is reported that she is being forced to perform a U-turn. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, might well smile but that is what is being said. It is reported that there will not be any attempt to resolve this matter in the short term. In the context of the social welfare Bill, can the Taoiseach confirm whether the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, will be bringing proposals before the House in the context of resolving this issue and beginning the reversal of the policy initiative that took place in 2012 under her predecessor, Deputy Burton?

The averaging rule dates back to 1961. The Minister for Finance's use of the word "bonkers" was in reference to the marriage bar, which ended in 1973 and which certainly was bonkers. That is a different issue again. The Minister for Finance has been extensively misquoted since then.

There will be generous provision to disregard periods of home caring. We are looking at some interim measures but the social welfare Bill, which was approved by Cabinet today, will implement the measures announced in the budget. It will not implement any of those interim measures because we do not yet have costing proposals to do so. We may not have these quite some time.

As the Taoiseach knows, if-and-when contracts, as they are known, are also rife in the journalism, education, health and construction sectors. Workers on contracts of this nature face massive difficulties in getting mortgages, planning their lives and planning their finances on a week-to-week basis. Today, the Mandate trade union has called on all Oireachtas Members to sign up to its Secure Hours - Better Future charter to end zero-hour and if-and-when contracts. I hope that the Taoiseach and his party will sign up to the charter. We are told that the employment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is yet to be published, will resolve these contractual matters. However, there is already a Bill before the House that enjoys cross-party support after dozens of hours of debate, expert witness hearings and amendments recommended by the members of the jobs committee. Why introduce rival legislation? The Dáil will debate the committee's report on the Banded Hours Contracts Bill 2016 on Thursday. Will the Taoiseach and his Ministers support the progression of that Bill and, by so doing, give workers the security they deserve?

In such circumstances, I encourage the Deputy to wait to see the Government's legislation and judge it after she has seen and read it. I know she will want to do that and will not want to reject it before she has seen it. It will be very much part of the drive forward by this Government, not just to aim for full employment but also to aim for better employment, better jobs, better terms and conditions, more security and pension rights for everyone.

The programme for Government includes a commitment to reduce poverty levels by supporting an increase in the minimum wage to €10.50 per hour. Despite the House having passed a Labour Party motion 18 months ago to increase the national minimum wage incrementally until it was pegged at 60% of median earnings, we have seen a 40 cent increase in the minimum wage with the next mite of it not to be paid until January. Meanwhile, the living wage itself continues to be revised upwards in light of continuing housing prices, in particular, and now stands at €11.70 an hour. Leaving aside this recommendation for a living wage of €11.70, when will the Government target of €10.50 an hour be reached?

Those who calculate the living wage do not take into account the views of employers. Any reasonable person in this House will agree that when setting wages, one should take into account the views of employers as to what impact it might have on employment levels. There is nothing lower than no wage at all.

In light of that, has the Government any legislation to deal with the situation reported in the past several months where there are delays of up to four years in dealing with harassment and inequality cases at the Workplace Relations Commission? For example, NUI women lecturers have taken a case but have been waiting two years for it to be heard. During the austerity period, the Equality Tribunal and several other organisations were disbanded and merged into the Workplace Relations Commission. Since then, the Government, as well as the previous one, has overseen a situation where a message has been sent out to women that there is not much point in taking a case because one would be waiting years and may well be in new employment etc. How does the Taoiseach expect people to take it seriously when this situation pertains?

The Government anticipated it would complete all Stages in the Seanad and, hopefully, be introduced into the Dáil before the recess but, if that is not to be the case, we expect it to be concluded early next year.

Going by the three-month timeline for implementation, the task force should have been established on 13 August 2016, which was 15 months ago yesterday.

The process is actually very nearly completed. I had a meeting with my officials yesterday. I had hoped to bring the matter to the Cabinet today but I did not want to bring something that was ... three-quarters baked. I have no doubt I will have it [finished] in the next couple of days.Did a report on this issue come to Cabinet today? Is it unrealistic for Members of this House, in light of these comments, to expect the issue to be addressed sooner rather than later? The Minister reiterated this comment on Thursday in committee. The Government does not require a majority in this House or the Upper House. This is a matter for the Government to act on, and the Minister indicated that on two occasions last week.

Recent reports show that some landlords have up to 15 people living in some rooms. This is an indictment and shows a lack of proper scrutiny and oversight in this sector.

The amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act, which were rushed through the House last December, introduced a loophole that, as the Taoiseach knows, allows landlords to issue notices to quit where they are undertaking substantial renovations. Threshold has expressed serious concern that this loophole is being abused and is being fraudulently used in as many as 12% of current cases of notice to quit. Is either the Taoiseach or the Minister considering reviewing this and bringing forward amendments to close this loophole to protect tenants?

We want to be positive about this, particularly in Science Week. However, we must also be realistic and, unfortunately, the rhetoric is not always based on fact. The Government's Innovation 2020 programme commits to a goal of 2.5% of GDP funding for research and development by 2020. We are barely halfway there. We hit 1.42% recently. The Nevin Economic Research Institute flagged this earlier this year as a serious risk to our economic progress. The Department's own figures suggest we are at the bottom of the European league table, and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, admitted the same - that the target will not be met - at a budget night briefing. How does the Taoiseach propose to address this gap?

This figure does not surprise me or many others in the north west. I have raised this issue often in this House but there has been no improvement. The reality is that the recovery is barely noticeable in my constituency and it is clear that the Action Plan for Jobs is not working in Sligo and the surrounding region. Will the Taoiseach and, perhaps, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation give consideration to these worrying new figures and indicate that this matter will be examined, quickly and in detail? I am concerned, as are others. As a Government Deputy, I am asked by many people in Sligo and the surrounding region about when we can expect jobs to be created there.

However, progress in this regard is uneven and Sligo has not performed as well as other counties. It will be a priority of Government in the months and years ahead to ensure that those parts of the country where the recovery has been slow will experience an acceleration in their recovery. A big part of that will be investment in infrastructure, which I know is of particular importance to Sligo. I will ask the Tánaiste to give a more substantive response to Deputy McLoughlin when she returns from the Middle East.

I spoke to the Taoiseach on two previous occasions about PRSI records for people who have made contributions but who now have to go through websites and so forth because records are not made available to citizens in paper form. The Taoiseach gave an indication five weeks ago that he would have this matter resolved. Has any progress been made with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to allow citizens advancing towards pension age to have their records be made freely available?

They have been waiting for driving tests for long periods. He clearly does not understand what it means to live in rural Ireland where people do not have access to public transport. Would it not be more productive if the Minister had made an order for speed limiters to be fitted to these cars while they are being driven by those on provisional licences? That would have made much more sense. There are speed limiters in lorries and buses and these could also be used in cars. These youngsters have to travel. I firmly believe that a young fellow is entitled to one chance and that every young fellow deserves that chance. If young fellows blot their copybooks, they can be nailed then but not before that.

The legislation will be before the House shortly. The Deputy will have the opportunity to speak on it and, perhaps, table an amendment to that effect should he so wish. We should not, however, forget that 13 young people with learner permits, 11 of whom were unaccompanied, have died on our roads while driving this year. That puts the matter into perspective. People with learner permits drive all the time but 11 of the 13 who died were unaccompanied.

The water charges issue was in the programme for Government. It is a very serious point. Through the tenant purchase scheme the Government is barring more than 80% of the people who live in local authority houses from purchasing those houses because of the statement that they have to be at work. In other words, they cannot be in receipt of an old age pension or a disability payment. That tenant purchase scheme is not fit for purpose and it has to be changed.

The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath was to establish a new mobility scheme to assist those with a disability. The Minister of State has said that this new mobility scheme will be up and running this year, in 2017. Speaking in the Dáil recently, the Taoiseach confirmed there was no budget allocation for such a scheme this year. Many families are suffering and cars need to be adapted. People are confused about this. Perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate when we can expect the health (transport support) Bill to come through the House.

The Government promised, quite some time ago, that there would be detailed sector-by-sector plans ready for such an eventuality. When the Taoiseach assumed office I asked him if the plans were ready and he said they were not. He also had no date for when they would be published. In response to a parliamentary question in May, the Taoiseach confirmed the plans were being progressed but did not know when they would be ready. In light of the potential imminent collapse of the Brexit talks and the risks we know this poses to this country, when will we see the detailed sector-by-sector Brexit-related reports we have been promised for so long?

The law at present, in respect of the defilement of a child under the age of 17, is set out in section 3 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006. It provides that any person who engages in a sexual act with a child who is under the age of 17 shall be guilty of an offence. The section also sets out the penalties for anybody found guilty of such an offence. I will outline the penalties. A term of seven years of imprisonment is provided for a person who is found guilty of the offence. If, however, the person is in a position of authority, the term of imprisonment that shall be imposed shall be a term not exceeding 15 years. The purpose of the legislation I seek to introduce is to increase those penalties, which we believe are too low. Currently, the maximum sentence is a term of seven years if one is not in a position of authority. Under the legislation I seek to introduce today, we would change that maximum sentence up to a term of 15 years. Similarly, if a person in a position of authority is found guilty of defilement of a child under the age of 17, we believe the maximum term of imprisonment should be changed from 15 years to a potential penalty of life imprisonment. Obviously we cannot dictate the sentence that a court will impose on any particular situation but we can set out what the maximum sentence should be. It is important that the Oireachtas should set out its revulsion of these offences by increasing the sentences that may be available to the courts. It is noteworthy that the legislation I have just referred to, and especially the sentences, are quite low when one considers the other sentences available for persons convicted of offences relating to children. For instance, anybody who meets a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation can, at present, face a maximum sentence of up to 14 years. Engaging in sexual activity in front of a child for sexual gratification can be subject to a sentence of up to ten years. In those circumstances we believe the penalty that currently exists is simply not strong enough. We seek to introduce this legislation to enable the Oireachtas to set out its abhorrence to these particular offences. I believe it is important to note that on many occasions, the Oireachtas criticises judges for sentences they impose. Members need to recognise that we have a responsibility when it comes to making law in respect of those sentences. If we believe sentences are not strong enough then we should do what we can do in this House by increasing the maximum sentence for a particular offence. By increasing the maximum sentence we are setting the tariff and are giving an indication to the courts that this is how society views these offences. I shall conclude. I believe that we in this House are too tolerant of certain types of criminal activity. The public is genuinely revolted by certain crimes against children and I do not believe that we reflect that adequately in our laws. Members need to become much more intolerant of crimes committed throughout the community such as repeat burglary and gratuitous violence against individuals and I hope that in the near future Fianna Fáil will bring forward legislation to show that. The time for being tolerant of criminal activity that is gratuitous, serious and which has a big impact on individuals should come to an end. I seek leave to introduce this legislation.

In 1998 and 2000, respectively, Fianna Fáil introduced the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act. Disability is one of the nine grounds of discrimination set out in the Acts. While the definition of disability includes mental illness, the definition within the Acts provides a restrictive medical definition of mental health. Attitudes, stereotypes and prejudices about mental health can lead to discrimination. In my role as mental health spokesperson, I regularly meet people who tell me they have been discriminated against because of their mental health status.These are people who find themselves treated less favourably than someone else solely because of their mental health status. For that reason, my party and I bring forward this Bill with a broadened definition of mental health to prevent discrimination on mental health grounds, on a human rights basis. This Bill seeks to add an expanded definition of mental health under the equality legislation. The Bill aims to solve three problems. First, it will help employees who may have mental health issues. It does so by tackling one of the obstacles facing people who suffer from a mental health issue in their employment situation, namely, discrimination. If enacted, it will be crystal clear for employers and employees alike that discrimination based on mental health status is against the law. The second problem it will address is the need to prohibit any attempt to limit services based on a person’s mental health status. This legislation will make it illegal to limit the provision of services based on a person’s mental health status. Discrimination on the grounds of mental health status violates the very principle of equality for which we all seek to strive. Finally, this Bill promotes equality by seeking to protect those who have been subjected to discrimination. It is crucial that every person is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of a person’s mental health status. This Bill will serve as a further step towards bringing Ireland in line with international standards on equality and understanding of mental health as a human rights issue and not just a medical illness issue.

My Department's primary role is to support me, as Taoiseach, and the Government in delivering on our programme. During the next three months, my Department will therefore support delivery of significant Government policy objectives, including the development of a ten-year capital investment plan alongside the national planning framework; ensuring that Ireland's Brexit priorities continue to be strongly represented in the ongoing negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom; supporting the peace process and the restoration of power-sharing in Northern Ireland; developing the Action Plan for Jobs 2018, including specific responses to the challenge of Brexit; finalising a roadmap for pensions reform; implementing Rebuilding Ireland to increase housing supply and tackle homelessness and developing the Government's response to the Sláintecare report. These are just a few of the many policies which will be progressed over that period. In most of these areas, the primary responsibility lies with the relevant line Department. The role of my Department is to help ensure that policies are developed and implemented in a coherent way across different Departments and to support me in my role as Head of Government. This includes my role as chair of Government meetings and Cabinet committees, attendance at the European Council, the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and other national and international engagements. My Department will also seek to ensure effective communication of Government policy in these and other areas. My Department is also currently updating its statement of strategy to reflect some of the changes that have taken place in recent months following my election. This includes the establishment of a new configuration of Cabinet committees and some changes in the functions of Ministers of State and of Departments.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	108	I thank the Taoiseach for his response. The key priorities facing the Taoiseach are numerous, as he acknowledges, but the key concerns for citizens are the housing crisis, the crisis in health and Brexit. All of these issues require a robust response from Government. One must ask, however, why a Government would act robustly when it fails to deal with basic facts and, indeed, peddles falsehoods. At the weekend, the Taoiseach made light of a serious problem affecting our society when he stated that Ireland had one of the lowest homelessness rates by international standards when compared with our peers. He was not, of course, comparing like with like in making this inaccurate claim. Other states across the OECD have broader definitions of homelessness. In addition, the OECD data for Ireland the Taoiseach's spin team used were out of date by two years. It is clear at page 1 of the report that different countries count homelessness in different ways. The figures published by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government do not include women and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence accommodation, those who are sofa surfing or those who are involuntarily sharing unsuitable accommodation in overcrowded circumstances. I hope for the sake of those experiencing homelessness that this was just another embarrassing gaffe by the Taoiseach and not an honestly-held belief. What is required is not the normalisation of the homelessness crisis but the building of homes and making them more affordable. Today's ESRI report, which shows that a 20% increase is likely over the next three years, and the daft.ie report, which shows rents increasing by over 11%, indicate that the problem is being compounded. I ask the Taoiseach to indicate what the Government is doing for people and to address the fact that he believes affordable housing is in the range of €315,000 to €395,000, which he says most people in his constituency could afford. Does he realise that households would have to have incomes of between €81,000 and €101,000 per year to afford that? There are many families and households who get up early in the morning but who could never aspire to that type of income.

Will he consider apologising and retracting the inaccurate and outrageous attempt to minimise and normalise a disastrous housing and homelessness crisis? I will remind him that he said "Ireland has one of the lowest homelessness [rates] by international standards compared with our peers - they're the stats, we can provide them for you". This comment coincides with a shocking and outrageous statement by Mr. Conor Skehan, the head of the Housing Agency, who says we need to stop using words like "homeless" and "crisis" and recognise that the crisis is "completely normal". That is shocking. One cannot take seriously the Taoiseach's claim that this is a priority for him or inject the sense of urgency necessary to deal with what is a catastrophic situation if that is the attitude. Will the Taoiseach withdraw those comments? Has he seen the statistics provided by Focus, which actually compare us with like comparators in Europe and which were compiled by Professor Eoin O'Sullivan in TCD? They were put out in the last few days and they show that Ireland actually compares badly and its position is much worse and worsening compared to countries where the data collected are comparable. I suggest the Taoiseach looks at them. They show that in comparison with Norway, Finland and Denmark, we have the worst proportion of homelessness by population and that homelessness has increased dramatically under Fine Gael. We have gone from a position of being better on homelessness in 2008 to being the worst of all of those countries. Those figures are actually comparable.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	110	Last week, the Taoiseach told the Dáil his Department needed to provide a counter-balance to the media, which he believes do not cover enough good news. The Taoiseach said 80% of news was negative and that it should really be approximately 50% at most. There will be a new strategy, the third in two years, and I am interested in how that new commitment will be reflected in it. The Secretary General is supposed to be chairing an interdepartmental group to ensure that the new strategic communications unit will not be politicised. However, the unit has begun to spend money on advertising and branding before the oversight group has even started its work. After a lengthy delay, we have received replies to a number of freedom of information requests we submitted concerning the unit. It will surprise no one that the head of the unit is most frequently in contact with the Taoiseach's political staff. In fact, emails between the Taoiseach's chief of staff and the head of the unit have been withheld on the basis of a claim that they are part of the deliberative process. Can the Taoiseach explain why the head of a supposedly non-political unit seems to have more contact with political staff in the Department than with his Civil Service peers? My overarching concern is what I see as the creeping politicisation of the State service in pursuit of a party political goal, which is something that must be guarded against at all costs.I echo what other Deputies have said on the housing crisis, which is a scandal, and what they have said about attempts to normalise it. I do not go for international comparisons or statistics because, every week, I meet people who are in appalling circumstances, from homelessness to the inability to get a house, having to stay with their parents and right along the continuum. It is everywhere and is a huge blight on our society and on our values as a country. We should not, in any shape or form, try to trivialise it or use language that understates the reality of the housing scandal for so many families and so many children in our community. We judge ourselves by our own standards and by what we believe to be best - nothing else. It is a very sad day when there are so many people in such dire circumstances in respect of housing, whether it is because of their rent or homelessness itself.

Most of us were a little bit taken aback last week when the Taoiseach told the House that it was his view that sufficient progress would likely be made in advance of the December European Council meeting to allow matters to move on to the second phase of negotiations. The Taoiseach is the first prime minister of the EU27 to voice such a view and, in light of the ongoing and accelerating chaos of the British Government, that is a surprising view. What will the Taoiseach's approach be, strategically, to the next European Council meeting? Is what he said still his view and if he is still optimistic, can he let us know the cause of his optimism? If, as he said in Enniskillen, we must make preparations for the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, what are the preparations he is making? Are contingency plans being made with Revenue? He stopped that happening earlier but is it now his view that we should recommence that process? Is it his strategic view that Ireland will not allow matters to proceed beyond phase 1 until such time as we have, in writing, a solution on the Irish Border question that meets Ireland's unique needs?

I simply draw Deputies' attention to my remarks at the time. International statistics always come with a health warning and different countries collect statistics in different ways and have different definitions, whether for unemployment, GDP and pretty much everything. Some countries have a wider definition of homelessness and others have a lesser definition. The reason we have a body like the OECD is that it compares like with like, to the extent that it is possible. Deputies are very happy to use OECD statistics on other occasions and I am not going to be selective about it. I am willing to use OECD numbers whether they are good or bad. In a recent The Irish Times article I read of a person living in one of the family hubs with her family, who was so satisfied with the accommodation she did not now feel homeless yet our statistics regard her as homeless. On "Morning Ireland" this morning I heard that some people believe that children in their adult years and who are living at home with their parents while saving up for a deposit should be considered homeless but I would not agree that somebody living with his or her parents was in the same category as somebody sleeping rough, with both considered homeless. I was asked a definite question about Ireland being among the highest for homelessness, which it is not. Nobody is now making that assertion. It was not an attempt to do anything or to normalise anything or play it down but a simple answer to a straightforward question, something I am often accused of not doing. I am certainly not interested in debating statistics here with anyone. I have heard other people doing it in the past few days but I have not got involved.

I am interested in talking about solutions. The leader of the Opposition has been in correspondence with my Secretary General about communications and I believe the latter has written a reply on the matter. I have not been party to that correspondence, which is from a unit in the Department, but I am sure Mr. Fraser has replied in full. The unit will be covered by public sector rules and no political work will be done. As is the norm for heads of sections in all Government Departments, they talk to politicians and their staff regularly. Contingency planning for Brexit is being carried out for all scenarios but it is just scenario planning. We are certainly not designing customs forms, nor would it be within our remit to do so as it is an exclusive competency of the European Union. We are not looking to hire Border staff or anything of that nature and any planning operates on a contingency basis. Deputy Howlin again made the assertion that I stopped Revenue making planning arrangements.

I had telephone calls with the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, on 16 October and on 1 November. In our conversation on 16 October, we discussed the latest developments in Northern Ireland at that time and urged a rapid resumption of talks, with a view to restoration of the Northern Ireland institutions urgently in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland. We also discussed Brexit, including the unique circumstances regarding the Border, and preparations for the upcoming meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 19 and 20 October. In our call on 16 October we also spoke about the damage from Storm Ophelia, the Bombardier case and the impact that may have on jobs in Belfast. The Prime Minister and I spoke by telephone again on 1 November to review progress made by the political parties in Northern Ireland since our previous telephone conversation, including in light of the statement to the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, the previous day. We agreed that it is still possible to form an Executive, which would be in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland. I underlined that there could be no return to direct rule as it existed prior to the Good Friday Agreement and that the various provisions of the Agreement would have to be honoured. The Prime Minister was clear that she did not want to see a return to direct rule and that moves to implement a budget for Northern Ireland should not be seen as a first step on the road to direct rule. We agreed that there is still time to reach an agreement and that the parties should continue to work to this end, with the support of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire. The Prime Minister and I agreed to stay in close contact on the matter over the coming period.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	120	I acknowledge that parties have a principled role in relation to the negotiations but there is also an obligation on the Taoiseach, his Government and the British Government. The Taoiseach and the Government are not spectators or commentators, nor is the British Prime Minister. They are all co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, with all the responsibilities that entails. Over the past ten months the focus of the negotiations has been on the issue of rights which are the norm on the rest of this island and in Britain. Marriage equality, language rights, the bill of rights, rights to legacy inquests and such things are not only supported by Sinn Féin but by the majority of those in the Assembly and in wider society. These rights benefit all sections of society and should threaten no one. The only reason they are being denied is that the DUP has resisted a rights-based agenda and the British Government has acquiesced in this.This is compounded by the fact the Tory-DUP pact is in place. It is completely unacceptable and I hope the Taoiseach has reflected this in his conversations with Theresa May. Sinn Féin did so in our conversation with her last week, and it is important that the Government does this on behalf of the Irish State. The issue of rights is not going away and it needs to be dealt with satisfactorily. For our part, we have done our best to be flexible and we did our best to stretch ourselves in the common good, and I believe the Taoiseach knows this. He also knows that in the context of an agreement on the delivery of rights, and these are rights which have already been agreed in previous agreements, Sinn Féin will enter government. In the absence of these rights the Executive is not sustainable. What is now needed is the two Governments to act urgently to deliver equality. This is their joint responsibility under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. This is to honour the outstanding commitments and deliver the rights enjoyed by everybody else on these islands to the people of the North who are being denied these rights. In the absence of doing this, perhaps the Taoiseach will enlighten us on which rights he believes we should forego.

In doing so he has, for now, ruled out direct rule, as the Taoiseach has in his answer to this question. What will happen in the absence of an agreement between the parties in Northern Ireland? If direct rule is ruled out by the British Government and the Taoiseach, and if no agreement is possible, and we have spent many months seeking such an agreement, between the parties democratically elected in Northern Ireland, what is the path the Taoiseach envisages out of this particular impasse? The British Labour Party Member of Parliament, Conor McGinn, has said there should not be direct rule from Westminster but that instead we should explore a new partnership arrangement between Dublin and London. Is there any out of the box thinking going on? Has the Taoiseach had a discussion in detail with Prime Minister May on what specifically they will do in the event of there being no direct rule and no Executive in Northern Ireland? How is the province is to be administered?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	122	For the past six years we have been told relations with the British Government have been excellent, yet every bilateral issue falls into neglect or some form of crisis. It is fair to say that previous to 2011 it would have been inconceivable that any Taoiseach or Prime Minister of any party would have taken such a hands off approach to the vital issues, particularly on the Good Friday Agreement and the institutions contained in the Agreement, and particularly the institutional crisis in Northern Ireland where there has been drift for a number of years, culminating in what I genuinely believe was the contrived collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive and assembly, notwithstanding the greatest crisis that faces the North and the island of Ireland, which happens to be Brexit. If we are to devise any credible approach in terms of a special economic zone, or reflect the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland in any Brexit solution, then it has to involve a devolved administration, legislature and Executive, through which a special economic zone or something similar could be achieved while respecting the constitutional status of the United Kingdom as contained in the Good Friday Agreement. Sinn Féin and the DUP have not worked this out. On the rights issue, it seems a majority in the assembly is now in favour of marriage equality, for example, so if the assembly came back it is quite plausible there would be a vote in favour of marriage equality. Not having it back is a delay to getting marriage equality through. I do not believe there is any huge resistance now to an Irish language Act.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	124	I am aware of the petition of concern. Let it flow and let it happen. Times are changing. Let the assembly meet and adjudicate on the issue. Likewise, I do not see any great barrier to the language Act. I am not aware of any great impediment to the establishment of an Irish language Act at this particular stage. If we are to have special arrangements in the context of Brexit there would have to be regulatory convergence with Europe. The only way this can happen is through a devolved administration being given the leeway to legislate or maintain convergence with the European Union. Has the Taoiseach raised with the British Government any proposals concerning a special economic zone or something similar for Northern Ireland? Last week, the Taoiseach indicated he felt a breakthrough was on the way. This was followed very quickly by indications that a breakdown might be on the way. Within the space of days this is what we were treated to. Fundamentally, there was an attitude from our Government that it was a matter for the British Government to sort out what special arrangements it may have. We have a role in thinking through scenarios that could be the solution, particularly for Michel Barnier and his team and the European Commission, who are very consistent in saying they want the rule of EU law to continue to apply. Therefore, we need to be creative in identifying the right potential solutions to what is a very grave issue for the citizens of this island and particularly for Northern Ireland.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	125	Deputy Martin's analysis of the situation is largely accurate. In terms of our conversations with the UK Government, to the extent we have spoken about special arrangements they are in the context of the paper agreed by the EU 27. That paper attempts to make real the promises made to us. We have all heard the language of the past 18 months, that there should be no hard border, no return to the borders of the past and no physical infrastructure along the Border, and we, not as Ireland but as the European Union, and as a negotiating party of 27 with the strength of all of Europe behind us, have set down in writing how we think that can be best achieved. We are not demanding that the UK or any part of the UK should have to remain in the customs union or the Single Market. We are, however, saying that if we are to honour this promise and commitment we have been given of avoiding a hard border or a return to the borders of the past there must be regulatory equivalence, if not between the United Kingdom as a whole and the EU then between Northern Ireland and the EU. It is set out in the paper, which has been extensively leaked at this stage, that the same rulebooks must apply. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, describes this very well. We cannot have a situation where a factory north of the Border making hair dryers could be given state aid by the UK Government while a factory south of the Border making hair dryers would be forbidden from receiving aid under state aid rules. We could not have a situation where the CAP in the Republic of Ireland as part of the European Union would require eight inspections a year whereas British or UK deregulation might only require four. This is what we mean by regulatory equivalence. It means the rules of the customs union and the Single Market continue to apply, even if the UK and Northern Ireland are not in the customs union. There are many examples of bespoke arrangements throughout Europe. The Isle of Man is one small one. It has never been in the EU or part of the UK. It does not pay into the EU budget or get anything out of it, but under a protocol to the Treaty of Rome, it, by its own legislation in its own parliament, adopts the rules and regulations of the Single Market and the customs union. It is a sovereign decision for it to do so because it is its own parliament that does it. Deputy Martin has touched very accurately on how the role of the Northern Ireland Assembly could be to do something exactly like this. Our preference, however, is that arrangements which would allow free trade to continue should not just be a special arrangement for Northern Ireland. We would like these arrangements to apply to the entire United Kingdom because that is what is most important for Irish jobs, the Irish economy, Irish businesses and Irish farmers. Let us not forget that most of the exports from business and farming in Ireland do not go to Northern Ireland but to England. A beef farmer's produce is probably going to go to England. The solution we want is one that protects free trade and free movement for the UK and Ireland and not a special arrangement just for Northern Ireland. That is a secondary outcome. It is not the preferred outcome. It may be better than the worst outcome, but our preferred outcome is an arrangement that allows us to continue to trade and travel freely with all of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland but not just Northern Ireland.By definition, a special arrangement for Northern Ireland means we are accepting new barriers between Britain and Ireland. Of course, that is damaging for our farmers, agrifood industry and exporters and also for trade and jobs. Those who are advocating a special arrangement as a great outcome need to understand they are proposing something very damaging for agrifood, farmers and Irish jobs and businesses.

However, that is not what I want to see happen.

I would rather see Ministers from this Government meeting Ministers elected by the people of Northern Ireland to discuss these matters. To respond to the first group of questions asked by Deputy Pearse Doherty, I absolutely agree that this Government is neither an observer nor a commentator. It is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been unbelievably engaged with this issue on the Government's behalf. He must have spent at least two days a week in Northern Ireland over the past four months. When he is dealing with the parties in Northern Ireland and with the UK Government, he speaks for me and the whole of the Irish Government. I have been far from hands off in my approach. I have met all the parties. I have met the DUP and Sinn Féin twice. I met the leaders of the DUP and Sinn Féin on a one-to-one basis - without officials - so that we could speak honestly and off the record. I speak to the Prime Minister every two weeks and I will speak to her again on Friday. I have travelled to Northern Ireland on three occasions since my election as Taoiseach. I have been to Belfast and Derry and I was in Enniskillen just last weekend. My analysis of the difference between Sinn Féin and the DUP is much closer to that of Deputy Micheál Martin than that of Deputy Pearse Doherty. I do not think this is about rights any more; I am of the view that it is about trust and terminology. It is almost a Swiftian situation at this stage. If people knew how small the difference is, I think they would be quite shocked in some ways.

I had a constructive meeting with President Macron in Paris on 24 October last. Our exchanges covered bilateral relations, the Brexit negotiations and the future of Europe. We were each accompanied by a small team of officials and advisers. The meeting provided a welcome opportunity to review the strong bilateral relations between Ireland and France, which is an important economic partner for us. Bilateral trade in goods and services between Ireland and France is worth approximately €2 billion every month. This is a solid platform on which to build and strengthen into the future, especially as Ireland looks to grow and diversify its markets. We discussed our co-operation in other areas, including Ireland's contribution to the EU training mission in Mali. We expressed our joint commitment to the planned Celtic interconnector, which will link our electricity networks, improve our connectivity and support export-driven development of Ireland's renewable sector. This represents the future-oriented agenda we both want to deliver. President Macron and I welcomed the progress achieved to date in the Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK and the more constructive tone of Prime Minister May in light of her recent speech in Florence. We agreed that further work is required on the three withdrawal issues - the rights of EU citizens, the UK financial settlement and the Irish-specific issues - before the European Council can decide that sufficient progress has been made to move to the second phase of the negotiations, which will deal with the future relationship and the transition arrangements. I thanked President Macron for his understanding and strong support with regard to Irish-specific issues like the common travel area and all the rights associated with it, the Good Friday Agreement and the Border. I took the opportunity to update him on relevant developments. We agreed that the 27 member states must remain united. We expressed our shared hope that it will be possible to make further progress in the coming months. France and Ireland are long-standing partners at EU level, particularly in the area of agriculture. We work together to protect rural communities and family farms. On Mercosur, we agreed on the need to protect our vital interests, especially in beef and agriculture, while opening up new export opportunities for our companies. President Macron and I agreed to stay in close contact on the situation in this regard as it evolves. As partners and friends, we are ready to discuss issues on which we do not necessarily agree, such as how best to tax Internet firms so that they pay their fair share. I outlined our view that this is a global issue which should be addressed at a global level and that the best way to achieve a successful outcome is to support the work that is under way at the OECD. More generally, President Macron and I agreed on the enormous potential of the digital economy and the need to ensure Europe provides the right economic environment for it to flourish. We want to see a dynamic and innovative entrepreneurial climate, with vibrant European companies scaling successfully on international markets. President Macron has brought a renewed energy to the debate about the future of Europe. We agreed that Europe needs to demonstrate the capacity to adapt to meet the challenges of the future, such as the digital revolution, the banking union, climate change, migration and security and defence. As I outlined to the House in my statement after the October European Council, there is a clear willingness among the 27 EU leaders to increase the pace of discussions on this issue while maintaining unity. We will continue our discussions at the social summit in Gothenburg on Friday during a lunch organised by President Tusk. In looking to the future, I outlined to President Macron my view that we need to focus on areas in which Europe can have a concrete and positive impact on the lives of citizens, including jobs, growth and investment in the digital Single Market and the Single Market itself. We discussed our respective plans to bring the debate on Europe to the public through the citizens' dialogue and other mechanisms. This is extremely important because other more extreme and divisive voices will gain traction unless we can offer an honest, positive and compelling agenda. My meeting with President Macron was followed by a business event organised by the Irish Embassy in partnership with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland and Bord Bia. This provided a useful opportunity to meet a range of Irish and French companies across a number of sectors and to discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise for business.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	133	I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply. Obviously, the UK is leaving the EU. The way things are going, it seems it is about to crash out of the EU. As a result of the UK's impending departure, the Franco-German axis is moving to centre stage in the context of the future of the European Union. There are moves for further EU integration. I am sure the Taoiseach discussed the future of the EU with President Macron. Ireland should be at the heart of that debate and have a positive input in respect of it. I note that the Taoiseach and President Macron agreed on many things, but I would like to ask specifically about defence. Yesterday, 23 member states signed up to the permanent structured co-operation project, which is known as PESCO. I understand that this new EU defence framework will be launched at next month's EU Council meeting. What is Ireland's position on this initiative? What effect will it have on Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality? Has the Cabinet approved PESCO? Will the matter come before the Dáil? To what aspects of PESCO might Ireland subscribe? Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, it seems that he and President Macron also discussed digital taxation and corporate tax harmonisation. This was probably another issue of difference at last month's meeting. Did the Taoiseach impress on President Macron that if his vision for digital taxation and corporate tax harmonisation comes to pass, it will threaten Ireland's long-standing economic model and represent a real threat to jobs, growth and living standards in this country? Can the Taoiseach provide assurances that he impressed on President Macron the importance this country attaches to those issues?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	134	It is good that the Taoiseach met the President of France.We have had a strong relationship with France over the years, particularly in terms of the CAP, although France has always had an envious eye on our corporate tax rates and has made interventions that have periodically reached varying degrees of intensity. It seems we are now back in a phase where President Macron is focusing on the issue of taxation. The points raised by Deputy Haughey are important in terms of President Macron's ambitions for Europe and the set of proposals concerning EU reform and development. President Macron's position is clear, as is the position of many other countries. What is unclear is Ireland's position. The Taoiseach has welcomed some of the proposals. He has said warm things about the general idea of President Macron's moving forward agenda. However, the Taoiseach has done so in a very vague way and nobody really has any idea as to what is his or Ireland's position. It is time we had a debate in this House and a proper, detailed examination and, ultimately, articulation of Ireland's position on the agenda for the future of the EU, particularly in a post-Brexit scenario. I know that a public consultation process is ongoing but that has had very limited impact in more recent times and more innovative ways must be considered. Fundamentally, this Parliament has a role and we should be engaged with that agenda.

The PESCO agreement, which they want to sign off on in December, is a step towards that. What President Macron and other European leaders think is clear. How does the suggestion that we may sign up to aspects of this agreement square with our tradition and position of military neutrality? The Taoiseach has made distinctions between a common foreign and security policy and involvement in a European military force or contributing to a defence budget. However, signing up to an agreement of this nature, a common foreign and security policy and pledges to progressively increase military expenditure hardly seem to be in line with protecting our neutrality, particularly when the architects and supporters of what is proposed are saying explicitly that it is a step towards the creation of a European army and a European common defence. Is talking about signing up to this not backdoor abandonment of our tradition of military neutrality?

It appears that there is a growing realisation across the EU that Brexit, particularly on the British Government's terms, is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement. The Taoiseach knows that Sinn Féin has been saying this from the outset. We see from last week's leaked papers a recognition that cross-Border co-operation is underpinned by EU legislation. The papers also make it clear that it is essential for the British Government to commit to avoiding a hard border, protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts and ensuring that the rules of the Single Market and the customs union are met. In our view, the only credible way to achieve this is special status for Northern Ireland within the EU. In other words, it is for Northern Ireland to remain within the internal market, the customs union and the EU legal framework. That would be possible if the Government presses for it in the Brexit negotiations. Europe is coming around to that view. The Taoiseach has a responsibility to ensure that this view is progressed and the Government has a responsibility not to waver or deviate from that position. The British Government needs to start coming up with the goods and putting meat on the bones in terms of what it is suggesting. It needs to bring forward explicit proposals to ensure that Northern Ireland remains within the Single Market and the customs union. Will the Taoiseach commit to using the Government's veto on progressing the talks to include the issue of trade if the British Government refuses to seriously deal with this issue? In our view, the best of way of doing so is special status for Northern Ireland within the EU. Were these issues raised with President Macron?

We want to see the full details before we make that decision. It will require a decision at Cabinet followed by a decision of the Dáil, so there will certainly be consultation with the major Opposition parties before a decision is made. We are favourably disposed towards it. I strongly believe that countries need to work together to respond to the new security threats we face in the modern world. I refer to international terrorism; cyber attacks, which nearly brought down health IT systems just across the water; uncontrolled mass migration; and trafficking of drugs and people. All of these things require co-operation across the Continent. They are not something that any nation state, even a big one, can manage on its own. We are not going to join a European army, however, or sign up to NATO and neither will we agree to a mutual defence pact, so we shall remain a neutral country. The triple-lock mechanism will remain in place. We think that is in our interests as a country. Ireland is never going to be a military power. The fact that we are not part of a military alliance gives us more influence in the world for a number of reasons. However, I do not agree with the assertion that increasing military spending necessarily conflicts with neutrality per se. Lots of other neutral countries spend far more on defence than we do. In the years ahead, we will need to upgrade our equipment and modernise our Defence Forces. This is something they very much want. The impact of pay restoration for members of the Defence Forces will require an increase in spending. As a result, I do not agree that increasing spending is a bad thing or that it undermines our neutrality. We affirmed our very strong view that the setting of taxes is a sovereign matter. While there are a number of European taxes that fund the European budget, national taxes should fund national budgets and it is up to parliaments such as this one to set taxes. We also reaffirmed our commitment to tax transparency. Tomorrow, with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, I will launch a public consultation on the future of Europe. This will be led by the Minister of State. I would particularly welcome a debate - either in the Dáil or at the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs - on what should be Ireland's position on the future of Europe debate. I will indicate my views on the matter in more detail tomorrow but I think I have already done so quite extensively in the House, if people wish to check the record. It was asked whether I would commit to use or threaten to use the veto. No, I will not. I do not think that would be in our interests. To use the veto would be to set ourselves apart from other countries and to stand alone. At present, our strength is that we are one of 27 countries and have the support of 26 other countries. Negotiating as one of those 27 puts us in a much stronger position in our dealings with the UK. The Sinn Féin nationalist "ourselves alone" position whereby we should set ourselves apart from our European allies, stand alone and threaten to use the veto would be a really big mistake strategically. The best way to get the best outcome for Ireland is to continue to be part of the 27 to ensure the 27 incorporate out needs into Europe's negotiating position. If we chose to isolate ourselves, which is very much the Sinn Féin political philosophy, it would do us serious harm.

The Creative Ireland programme is not a funding body and does not administer any specific grant or funding schemes. Neither is it my intention that it will become such a funding body in the future. An enabling budget of €5 million was allocated to implement and promote the Creative Ireland programme from within my Department in 2017. To date, €4 million has been expended in this regard. This includes €1 million which I allocated to the local authorities to support their culture and creativity plans for 2017 and €1.1 million towards planning and rolling out Cruinniú na Cásca on Easter Monday. I allocated an additional €0.5 million to developing two websites to inform the public at home and abroad - creativeireland.ie and ireland.ie - and associated digital content and social media platforms to support these websites. This has been supported by extensive citizen engagement in the programme which to date has cost €600,000. In addition, the opportunity was taken in 2017 which is its initial year to engage and collaborate with several key cultural partners at various important national events and festivals in order to promote the objectives and underlying values of this major new programme and to encourage deeper understanding and appreciation of the role of creativity. Among the considerations used to identify key cultural partners was a definitive creative element to their programme, their track record in delivering a programme and their capacity to attract and engage a significant audience. To date €250,000 has been spent on this element of the programme. The remaining €550,000 has been expended on administrative and everyday operational costs associated with the Creative Ireland programme office in my Department. All programmes administered by my Department are subject to public financial procedures and are monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure value for money. Programmes can also be subject to periodic monitoring through the Department's internal and external audit facilities.

Creative Ireland emerged from the Government's broad cultural 2025 strategy document. All of the Government initiative was welcomed at its launch in December 2016. The arts world welcomes the enhanced level of co-ordination that promised to put culture and creativity at the centre of public policy. Almost one year has passed since the launch and there is an air of ambiguity around the role of Creative Ireland, particularly when it comes to the distribution of its budget. Budget 2018 saw the allocation of €8.5 million to Creative Ireland. How will this money be spent? Has Creative Ireland become an alternative funding agency to the Arts Council? Is the allocation of €8.5 million the beginning of an attempt to usurp the role of the legislatively independent Arts Council?

The €8.5 million in current funding across the cultural sector will assist in delivering the objectives of the Creative Ireland programme, including the €3 million of that allocation which is being provided to the Arts Council. I was delighted to increase the funding to the arts sector in budget 2018. I was able to increase the funding to the arts sector and to the cultural institutions right across the board. I increased funding to the Arts Council by a further €3 million. I increased funding to the Irish Film Board and all the different agencies that fall within my remit. I am glad to say that since 2014, I have been in a position to do that. I want to be clear not to conflate the Arts Council and the Creative Ireland programme because they are separate in terms of their funding. Creative Ireland is an enabling programme. At its heart is the creative children and creative communities programmes and building and working more collaboratively with all the stakeholders.

My concern is what Creative Ireland's role is in terms of funding. I do not think it is very honest to say that Creative Ireland is not funding certain projects. Creative Ireland has had its logo on many very reputable and distinguished arts festivals around the country, such as the Kilkenny Arts Festival and Galway Arts Festival. Will the Minister be clear with us because there is ambiguity and concern in the arts world? Which is the leading agency for artists and artist supports? Is it Creative Ireland or is it the Arts Council? The Arts Council got a mere €3 million increase in the budget. It is a far cry from what was promised by the Taoiseach, who promised to double the arts budget. The Minister took me up wrong. I did not say the Minister got an additional €8.5 million. Creative Ireland got €8.5 million from the Arts Council. On this issue, John McAuliffe, who is deputy director of the Arts Council, asked what kind of application processes, peer reviews and long-term planning will influence how taxpayers' money is spent. We do not know the answer to that. I am hoping the Minister can clarify that very important question for me.

It was set up to collaborate and work with all the different agencies. The Deputy mentioned a number of them. The creative children programme, which followed on from the arts in education programme, will get €1 million in 2017. The local authorities got €1 million in funding last year. I did not have an input in deciding how it was spent. The local authorities supported a number of different initiatives in their own counties. It has been very successful. Culture teams have been set up in every local authority. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government gave them a further €1 million so they had €2 million in total to support different initiatives within their own local authority. I had absolutely no input into that funding. The purpose of Creative Ireland is to work collaboratively across the different agencies to put culture and creativity at the heart of society. It is working very well. Creative Ireland had a presence at a number of festivals around the country. We engage with several key cultural partners at various important national events and festivals. The Deputy mentioned one that was in that group. Its purpose was to get the message out about Creative Ireland.

That is the question the Deputy raised with me, so I will answer it first. A review has recently been carried out by my Department of all relevant records and engagements between the Department and the board, management and staff of the National Museum of Ireland and any third parties regarding certain issues that have arisen in recent years. The review is published on my Department's website and contains recommendations which I have accepted.The review proposes that the Department should continue to support the chair and board of the museum in the introduction and implementation of measures to provide for enhanced HR capacity in the National Museum of Ireland, and in addressing issues raised in the recent staff well-being survey; and continue to be satisfied that the NMI is meeting the requirements set out in the code of practice for the governance of State bodies on risk management, internal control, internal audit, and audit and risk committees. Regarding the first recommendation, my Department has already sanctioned three specific HR positions and two temporary positions for the corporate services area of the National Museum. Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity, respect, fairness and equality in the workplace be it in the National Museum or anywhere else. In recent times, there have been a number of alarming allegations and reports of sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace relating to the arts community. While all workplaces are obliged to comply with employment legislation, I have identified a number of actions that I can take as Minister regarding the bodies reporting to my Department. I commend the women who have come out in recent weeks and told their stories. It is very brave of them and I am glad they did so. I intend to help boards under the aegis of my Department fulfil their functions more effectively, and to support them in ensuring that policies regarding equality and respect in the workforce operate effectively in line with best practice. These actions include: arranging separate dedicated governance workshops for board members and senior staff with a particular emphasis on issues relating to bullying, abuse of power and sexual harassment in the workplace; working on a collaborative basis with the Arts Council to make similar training available to other cultural organisations and arts centres around the country at a series of regional information days; highlighting once again to bodies reporting to the Department the nature of their legal obligations by seeking assurances of their compliance with obligations under employment legislation; and accelerating a planned review of compliance by bodies reporting to the Department with the requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. I am confident that these support measures will contribute to the further enhancement of existing governance structures in bodies reporting to my Department.

This information should be in her hands. The report her Department has published is a whitewash. The Minister has seen a letter detailing the bullying that is happening in the National Museum and yet it has been dismissed in the Department's report as having no legal standing. The Department has received a self-identified protected disclosure and yet it employed a firm of solicitors to fight that protected disclosure. A large number of people have been to the High Court and received settlements - State money. Despite this, the Minister claims she has no responsibility in the matter. Millions of euro have been paid to consultants and for reports with regard to psychologists on this issue and yet nothing of significance is being done. Stacks of surveys detail the massive amount of complaints of bullying. This weekend even the former director of the museum came out and said he had witnessed uncontrolled misogyny in the museum when he was leaving. He is concerned that it is still there. We know that a psychotherapist, who had been employed by the museum, blew the whistle and sent a letter to the Department in 2011 identifying exactly what had happened. This weekend the front page of a newspaper reported another brave woman's experience of what has happened in the museum. There is a forest of signposts clearly pointing the direction on the issue and yet the Department's report states that there is nothing to see here.

I have been very supportive of the chair and the members of the new board, whom I appointed in July 2016. They are doing a wonderful job in implementing change in the museum as well as preparing new plans to improve the museum's services to the public in the coming years. My Department has already sanctioned three specific HR positions and two temporary positions for the corporate services area of the museum to assist in this process.

Other staffing matters which came to the attention of the Department at that time were referred to the museum, as the employer. Under the Act, the museum has responsibility for its staff as is clearly set out. This is all dealt with in the review which specifically acknowledges that in 2012 certain allegations of bullying were referred to the museum, which rejected the issues raised. Referring the matter follows logically from the role of the institution as the employer. It refers and then any Minister is bound to respect the statutory independence put in place by the Oireachtas.

There is a comparable gravity between the treatment of the staff in the National Museum and the other cultural institutions under the spotlight now. The Minister should ensure that no cultural institution is left behind in this process. We need a proper investigation into what has happened in the National Museum of Ireland. The Minister needs to ensure that nobody in any of these institutions is ever again confused about being allowed to run institutions in this manner and still receiving money from the public purse. She needs to send the message loud and clear that money will not leave the public purse unless people get their houses in order on this issue.

The code, which is published on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's website, sets out the respective roles of parent Departments, boards and chairs of individual bodies, and includes details of the oversight and performance delivery agreements to be entered into by both parties. The implementation of the oversight and performance delivery agreements by individual bodies is monitored by officials of my Department who meet the individual bodies on a regular basis to review progress on performance objectives and governance matters. All recipients of State funding, either directly from my Department or through an intermediary funding body, are also subject to the provisions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 13/2014, Management of and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer Funds, which outlines the public financial management principles, procedures and additional reporting requirements to be followed in the management of grant funding provided from public money. In addition to the above, last week I announced a series of measures designed to support bodies in meeting their governance obligations. These include arranging training for board members and senior management staff of bodies directly reporting to my Department in the area of governance in general and on issues relating to bullying and harassment in the workplace - my Department is also working on a collaborative basis with the Arts Council to make similar training available to other cultural organisations and arts centres around the country at a series of regional information days; highlighting again to bodies reporting to the Department the nature of their legal obligations, by immediately writing to them to seek assurances of compliance with obligations under employment legislation - the Employment Equality Acts, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, and the Employment Equality Act 1998 (Code of Practice (Harassment) Order 2012; and accelerating a planned review----Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseA further measure announced is the acceleration of a planned review of compliance by bodies reporting to the Department with the requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.

Her Government colleagues have been at pains to emphasise that the Gate Theatre is not a State body but she and I both know it received significant funding from her Department to the tune of €860,000 in public money in 2017. Therefore, we certainly have a responsibility and a role to play in the context of this issue, given that the theatre has received that level of public funds. For example, the former director was the director of the theatre for 33 years, for more than three decades, and he was also a member of the board. Many of the board members served on the board for a long number of years alongside the director over the course of his more than three decades on the board. Many of the board members would have had a prior personal association with the former director. Does the Minister consider it is acceptable that a body in receipt of State funding would have in place such inappropriate governance structures? Will she outline her plans to review the governance structures of bodies in receipt of funding from her Department? Has she any future plans regarding the funding of agencies or organisations, such as this one, that do not have in place proper governance structures?

Boards and directors of theatres and of any of the other cultural institutions must take on board their responsibilities. There are legal obligations to which they must adhere. While the Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions, I understand a number of conditions related to financial assistance being operated by the council apply to its funding recipients.

In the context of the overview and oversight of that from the Minister's Department, it is important that good governance structures are in place in any organisation that is in receipt of funding, be it from the Arts Council or Creative Ireland and that receipt of such funding would be contingent on having proper procedures in place. It is not acceptable for a person to be a director and a member of the board because that comprises the board. As I have stated publicly, in terms of instilling public confidence in respect of governance, there are issues with a board having a serving chief executive officer also serving as a member of the board. I hope the Minister will address that issue in the context of any plans she may have to introduce guidelines on what is and is not appropriate because it is far from appropriate to have a person serving as a director and a board member and then expect the board to investigate what has been going on internally.

I will arrange separate dedicated workshops for board members and senior staff of bodies reporting to my Department. I am happy to expand that to arts and cultural organisations across the country. I will provide training on corporate governance with a particular emphasis on bullying and harassment. This is unacceptable behaviour. I do not want to see this happening. Nevertheless, there are huge responsibilities on people in each of those organisations. There are rules and regulations in place with which they should comply, and they should have policies and procedures in place. I want to facilitate them and to make sure they put proper structures in place. I can only encourage them. It is their decision and at the end of the day they have to do that. I want to remind them that there are legal obligations in place. I want to work with the sector so that we can stamp out this sort of behaviour. What we have been reading in the newspapers in recent weeks is awful.

What assurance can she give to the thousands of students who are potentially thinking of pursing a career in the arts that if they do so, they will not face harassment and bullying?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	160	The governance of publicly funded theatres, as with all bodies, is a matter for the board of the theatres themselves. All boards have a duty to ensure their bodies comply with statutory requirements and that their staff can work in a safe and respectful environment. In recent times, as we know, there have been a number of alarming allegations and reports about sexual harassment in the workplace relating to the arts community. That is why I have invited the group of eight leaders from Irish theatre organisations, who recently co-signed a statement condemning sexual harassment and abuse of power in the theatre in Ireland, to meet with me and the Arts Council this week. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss ways in which the Department and the Arts Council together can support the sector in creating a safe culture and environment for those working in the industry. More broadly, I have been engaging with the Arts Council and the national theatre to facilitate an industry-wide consultation exercise to be held before the end of the month. As I have said, I believe that, working together, my Department, the Arts Council and leading members of theatre organisations can encourage a safe and respectful environment free from abuse of power and sexual harassment. I have also identified a number of actions I can take as Minister in regard to the bodies reporting to my Department. The intention is to help boards fulfil their functions more effectively, and to support them in ensuring that policies in regard to equality and respect in the workforce operate effectively in line with best practice. These include arranging separate dedicated governance workshops for board members and senior staff with a particular emphasis on issues relating to bullying, abuse of power and sexual harassment in the workplace; working on a collaborative basis with the Arts Council to make similar training available to other cultural organisations and arts centres around the country at a series of regional information days; and highlighting once again to bodies reporting to the Department the nature of their legal obligations, by seeking assurances of their compliance with obligations under employment legislation.

I suggest to the Minister that this is quite a crisis in the Irish arts and theatre. We do not know how pervasive it is in other areas of the arts. Maybe it does not really happen or maybe it happens on a wide scale. What we know about artists and those working in the arts is that there is always a huge amount of energy, passion and commitment - they are all the good things. However, when it goes wrong, as it seems to have in this case, how is the Minister going to create an atmosphere in which people going into that career can be resilient enough in respect of somebody who tries to speak to them in this way and gives them their marching orders as soon as they even attempt to challenge it? The matter is definitely extremely damaging to our national arts reputation.

It has to be changed and that is why I want to remind, retrain and highlight again the responsibilities that individual organisations have towards their staff. It is important that they are made aware of it. Sometimes practices creep in and become the norm although they are unacceptable. That is why people need to familiarise themselves with good practice and the law governing all of this - employment law and provisions in respect of harassment and bullying in the workplace. There is a lot of legislation there. In fact, we probably have some of the best legislation in Europe in that respect. It is about adhering to that legislation and changing the culture. First of all, I am bringing in the heads of the theatre organisations who signed the statement. I want to have a conversation with them and to hear what they have to say. I am happy to work with them and I want to work with the sector to stamp out this type of behaviour. It is absolutely unacceptable. As the Deputy rightly says, we want to see that it is a safe environment for young people entering the industry.

There should be a mechanism whereby people can bring issues up at board level, yet in all the reports we have seen this seems to be what was totally missing. People were very unhappy about what was happening but they had no way to address it. When my party went into government with Fine Gael, it wanted to combine all the artistic bodies into one entity. It wanted to abolish the boards of each of the national cultural institutions. Deputy Tóibín has raised the National Museum. If there was staff representation of, at a minimum, one woman and one man, at least there would be a vehicle whereby material could be raised at board level. We can talk about all the HR stuff we like. This is about people being really badly treated. They must have been very shocked even to have been spoken to or about in the manner reported. The same is true of the museum. Some of the quotes on the museum are really horrific.

Is ionann an plean seo agus an creatlach pleanála fadtréimhseach faoina ndéanfar cúram d’fhás agus rath na hÉireann. Bainfear leas as an bplean chun rianú a dhéanamh ar na deiseanna pleanála a bheidh ann go ceann scór bliain mar a bhaineann sé le gnóthaí pleanála ar bhonn náisiúnta réigiúnacha agus áitiúla. Leagtar béim faoi leith sa phlean - a raibh an deis ag an bpobal a dtuairimí a thabhairt ina leith go dtí 3 Samhain - ar a thábhachtaí is atá sé an uathúlacht a bhaineann le cultúr saibhir na hÉireann a chaomhnú agus a chothú agus tá an Ghaeilge mar chuid lárnach den chultúr ar ndóigh. Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte de go dtógfar san áireamh mar is cuí in ullmhúchán an leagain chríochnúil den phlean go bhfuil tábhacht faoi leith ag an nGaeltacht mar fhearann dúchais na Gaeilge agus go mbeifear ag féachaint chuige go dtapaítear le gach deis chun go n-aithnítear é sin mar is cuí sa leagan deiridh. Mar a bhaineann sé lena bhfuil ar bun agus beartaithe sa ghearrtréimhse maidir leis an nGaeltacht go sonrach, beidh a fhios ag an Teachta go n-aithnítear sa chlár do Rialtas comhpháirtíochta go bhfuil tábhacht faoi leith ag na ceantair Ghaeltachta mar a bhaineann sé leis an ollchuspóir cúram céimiúil a dhéanamh d'fheidhmiú na Straitéise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge. Sa chomhthéacs sin, beidh a fhios ag an Teachta go luaitear go sonrach sa chlár go bhfuil sé i gceist díriú ar fhostaíocht a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht trí Údarás na Gaeltachta agus spreagadh a thabhairt do leanaí freastal ar réamhscoileanna nó ar naíonraí trí mheán na Gaeilge sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, is ábhar sásaimh é, mar shampla, gur éirigh leis an Údarás 559 post a chruthú anuraidh agus go raibh 80 duine breise fostaithe i gcuideachtaí an Údaráis sa Ghaeltacht ag deireadh na bliana 2016 i gcomparáid leis an mbliain roimhe sin. Tá sí mar aidhm ag an Údarás 500 post úra a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht sa bhliain reatha. Chomh fada is a bhaineann sé le gnóthaí luathoideachais sa Ghaeltacht, tá obair fhónta ar bun agus beartaithe ag an eagraíocht Comhar Naíonraí na Gaeltachta a fheidhmíonn faoi scáth an Údaráis chun cúram a dhéanamh den earnáil luathoideachais Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht mar thaca d'fheidhmiú rathúil an phróisis pleanála teanga agus an pholasaí don oideachas Gaeltachta araon.  Ag croílár na hoibre seo ar ndóigh, tá an próiseas pleanála teanga. Ós rud é nach fada eile go mbeidh ullmhúchán pleananna teanga ar bun sa trí limistéar pleanála teanga in oirthear Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe, is ionann sin agus an próiseas a bheith idir lámha i ngach aon cheann den 26 limistéar pleanála teanga sa Ghaeltacht.
Eolas breise nár tugadh ar úrlár an Tí.
 Mar léiriú ar thiomantas an Rialtais chun cúram a dhéanamh den phróiseas, beidh ciste ionann le €2.65 milliún curtha ar fáil ina leith i mbuiséad 2018. Is ionann sin agus ardú €1.8 milliún thar an allúntas atá ar fáil don phróiseas sa bhliain reatha. Ó cuireadh tús le feidhmiú an phróisis trí bliana ó shin, tá arduithe céimiúla ceadaithe ina leith agus fágann sé seo go bhfuil an ciste pleanála teanga imithe ó €200,000 in 2014 go dtí €2.65 milliún an bhliain seo chugainn. Níl anseo ach spléachadh ginearálta ar an obair fhónta atá ar bun agus beartaithe ar leas na Gaeltachta. Is léiriú é chomh maith ar dháiríreacht an Rialtais tacú leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta mar fhearann dúchais na Gaeilge. Ní call a rá go leanfaidh mo Roinn féin agus an tÚdarás ag obair as lámh a chéile chun an leas is fearr is féidir a bhaint as na hacmhainní suntasacha a bheidh ar fáil ón Státchiste chun tacú leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta agus go bhféachfar chuige go ndéantar é seo ar bhealach a luíonn isteach le mianaidhmeanna an chreatlaigh náisiúnta pleanála.

#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	192	There is a misunderstanding in the question. The Creative Ireland programme did not get an additional €8.5 million in the budget. Rather, the €8.5 million in current funding across the cultural sector will assist in delivering on the objectives of the Creative Ireland programme, including the €3 million of that allocation which is being provided to the Arts Council. In budget 2018, I announced a funding package of over €300 million in 2018 towards the development of our cultural and creative heritage. This represents an increase in funding to my Department of €13 million, comprising €9 million in current expenditure and €4 million in capital expenditure. I also secured an additional €90 million in capital funding between 2018 and 2021 for my Department which will accelerate investment across the culture, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors. Of the €13 million in additional funding I secured for my entire Department in 2018, I allocated €8.5 million, equivalent to 65%, to arts and culture. From this €8.5 million in additional funding, I allocated an additional €2.56 million to the national cultural institutions, an additional €1.55 million to the Irish Film Board, €1 million to the Creative Children project, and €500,000 to Culture Ireland while the Arts Council received an additional €3 million. The total Arts Council allocation of €68.2 million in 2018 represents 23% of total allocation to all areas of my Department. This is over 49% of all current expenditure by the culture division of my Department. The Creative Ireland programme is a high-ambition all-of-Government initiative to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation to ensure, individually and collectively, we can realise our full creative potential. The Arts Council is a key partner in the programme, along with Departments, cultural institutions, local authorities and many others in the arts and cultural sector.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 I value the support and expertise of the Arts Council and will continue to work with it as we roll out the Creative Ireland programme, recognising the proper remit of both my Department and the Arts Council, and recognising also what can be achieved when everyone in the sector works together. By providing funding increases to key institutions, agencies and initiatives that deliver arts, creativity and culture right across the country, I am ensuring that this momentum will continue in 2018 and beyond.

I am interested in the Minister's thinking and logic behind the Arts Council as opposed to Creative Ireland. While I appreciate all the other figures she gave us, I am interested in these two specific bodies. The Arts Council is an independent statutory organisation, independent of politics, with an arm's length approach to support and assist artists and creative industries across the country. The Minister knows the chair of the Arts Council publicly expressed her disappointment at the additional €3 million allocation to the Arts Council budget, stating it would severely hamper its ability to broaden supports to artists and organisations nationwide. An additional €8 million represents a mere 3% increase on previous years’ allocations, down from 5% year-on-year increases that had been given to the Arts Council budget up to 2017. The budget remains €15 million below 2008 levels. The Arts Council is the main funding agency for the arts. In her reply, the Minister acknowledged the independent and critical role it plays in the arts. Will she focus her reply on the two bodies, the Arts Council and Creative Ireland?

I am glad I have been able to increase that budget by 20% since taking office in 2014. I absolutely respect the independence of the Arts Council and value its support and expertise. I will continue to work with it as we roll out the Creative Ireland programme, recognising its proper remit and that of my Department along with what can be achieved when all in the sector work together. By providing funding to key institutions, agencies and initiatives that deliver arts, creativity and culture throughout the country, I am ensuring that this momentum will continue in 2018 and beyond. The core Creative Ireland programme budget will be maintained at €5 million, which is the same as this year, with a further €1 million to be provided toward implementing the Creative Children plan, which I know the Deputy very much supports because it is a wonderful initiative to assist children to engage in culture and the arts.
#NiamhSmyth	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-party	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-dob	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	195	As the Minister said, €8.5 million was allocated in the budget in order to accelerate the delivery of the objectives of Creative Ireland. However, it is entirely unclear to me and to many in the arts community how that money will be spent. I am concerned that Creative Ireland is going to either duplicate or usurp the function and role of the Arts Council. I am not alone in my concerns that it will become the alternative agency for funding the arts in Ireland. The allocation of €3 million to the Arts Council is nowhere close to what it and the arts community expected as a commitment from the Government to increased funding for the arts. How does the increase of €13 million to the Minister's Department fit with the Taoiseach's promise to double the arts budget over the next seven years and has the Department been given a map of projected increases to meet that pledge? Organisations need greater certainty on future funding and to know the figures in order that they might plan ahead.

As regards the Taoiseach's commitment, he said he wants to double funding for arts, culture and sport between now and 2025. He did not specifically say that he would double the Arts Council budget. There are many deserving bodies across the arts and culture spectrum, such as our national cultural institutions, the Irish Film Board, Culture Ireland and the Arts Council. I am pleased to say we increased funding across the board for arts and culture in budget 2018. The increases need to be incremental and sustainable because nobody wants to go back to the bad old days of reckless spending. As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has repeatedly stated, the unsustainable increases of today are the cutbacks of tomorrow.

However, many people are utterly confused about why Creative Ireland now appears to be the priority body for funding rather than the Arts Council which, unfortunately, suffered big cuts to its budget when the economy collapsed. They do not understand why those cuts were not restored. As Tánaiste, I was one of the biggest supporters of the arts budget. It lost out big time in budget 2018. All Members understand that. Creative Ireland has begun to sound more like an arts wing of the strategic communications unit. It seems to be about photo opportunities and precious little else but there is an important role to be played in terms of co-ordination. However, all I see from Creative Ireland is spin and photo opportunities for the Taoiseach, in particular, and the Minister. That is not good enough in terms of spending because there is so much else that needs to be done.

I have increased its budget progressively every year since I was appointed Minister in 2014. Creative Ireland does not get priority funding. It received €5 million last year and will get the same this year to assist local authorities to roll out the Creative Children programme. The Deputy will agree that setting up culture teams in local authorities has been extremely successful. Both counties in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan have a Creative Ireland plan and culture teams in place. This system is working extremely well. More and more people are engaging with the arts and culture and that is good. I want to be very clear on the funding.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	201	My question is very similar to that of Deputy Niamh Smyth and relates to the same issue. There seems to be some confusion. The amount of money allocated to the arts in Ireland is way below the European norm. The Taoiseach has promised a lot more but we are playing catch-up and it seems that is going to continue. Given that the arts is so important to the Irish people, more should be done. One would think it thrives in spite of the Government rather than because of it. Will the Minister clarify the relationship between the Arts Council's ten-year Making Great Art Work strategy and that of the new entity, Creative Ireland?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	202	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The most important thing is that all involved in the arts sector work together to promote and encourage more people to get involved and participate in the arts. The Taoiseach has said he will double the overall budget for arts, culture and sport over the next seven years. We can meet that target by implementing sustainable increases on an incremental basis between now and 2025, which is a process initiated in budget 2018 in spite of it being a tight year across the board. In the context of the budget, I announced a funding package of over €300 million in 2018 towards the development of our cultural and creative heritage, which is an increase in funding to my Department of €13 million, comprising €9 million in current expenditure and €4 million in capital expenditure. That includes a boost of €8.5 million in funding for arts and culture. I also secured an additional €90 million in capital funding for my Department between 2018 and 2021, which will accelerate investment across the culture, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors. As part of the €8.5 million in additional funding, the Arts Council will receive an extra €3 million to enhance its support to artists and arts organisations of all sizes throughout the country.  The total Arts Council allocation of €68.2 million for 2018 represents 23% of the total allocation to all areas of my Department or over 49% of all current expenditure by the culture division of my Department. I also allocated an additional €1.55 million to the Irish Film Board, which is an increase of 9.3%. As the economy continues to improve in the coming years, the Government's ambition is to allocate more resources to arts and culture and to continue to build on the foundations I have put in place in budget 2018.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	203	There are concerns about how the money is being used. What is the Minister's response to Emmet Kirwan, the brilliant playwright, who said that Creative Ireland's so-called fifth pillar "appears to be that artists should get on message and it commodifies the arts and co-opts artists to put forward an idealised version to the world of what Ireland is like, which is a branding exercise; but artists put forward to the world what Ireland actually is or they challenge ideas about what Ireland is"?Here Mr. Kirwan seems to express a legitimate worry that Creative Ireland is little more than a marketing plan and a way to control what is created. This is not a far-fetched idea, seeing as the brains behind the operation is John Concannon, who now heads up the Government's new strategic communications unit. What does the Minister have to say to this?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	204	Pillar 5 of the Creative Ireland programme aims to unify our global message to the world. The Deputy will appreciate that during the 1916 commemorations in 2016 there was huge engagement in our culture right across our embassies - right across the world, actually. Many different events were held in our embassies and attended by many among our diaspora and indeed others who wanted to engage in Irish culture. Culture Ireland will receive an extra €500,000 next year, which will enable an enhanced culture programme to be presented across Great Britain in 2018. This will build on the unique cultural relationship between the two countries and expand the reach of Irish culture to new audiences. It will also build on Pillar 5 of the Creative Ireland programme, which hinges on extending our cultural footprint globally and highlighting our culture as a unique national strength. This is very important because the IDA says culture is the best calling card it has and that it opens doors for the IDA. It is therefore very important we send out a good message internationally about how rich is our culture. It is a good news story.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	208	The justification for handing this funding to Creative Ireland is "to accelerate its programme". Is there an effort on the part of Creative Ireland to eclipse the Arts Council? The Arts Council's own ten-year strategy, Making Great Art Work, was published, strangely enough, without any reference whatsoever to the Department's own ten-year cultural policy, Culture 2025, which is supposed to be the foundation document of the control of arts funding. People are worried that more money is now going into controlling this in the background. Perhaps we are getting it wrong; I am only expressing the concerns of people involved in the area.

The arts does help to project Ireland, but that is not the purpose of the arts; it is one of the bonuses of the arts. It is very philistine of her to say that the IDA says the arts are its best calling card. They may be, but that is not the purpose of the arts. The purpose of the arts is for artists in Ireland to be able to express their creativity and tell us about ourselves.

There are five pillars in the Creative Ireland programme. Pillar 1 concerns children, Pillar 2 concerns community, Pillar 3 concerns cultural institutions, Pillar 4 concerns media production and Pillar 5 aims to unify our global message to the world. What I am saying is very clear. We want to let people know the rich and varied cultural offering we have in this country and let them know that Ireland is a good place to come to live, invest, work or study. That is the purpose of Pillar 5. There seems to be a confusion in Deputy Wallace's comments. Creative Ireland is a legacy programme for 2016. Culture 2025 is my Department's cultural policy and will soon be finished. It went through the Oireachtas committee and has come back and we are finalising it. I see Creative Ireland as the implementing body capable of implementing the actions and policies in Culture 2025. We want to spread culture and creativity right across Irish society, starting with children, communities, cultural institutions, media and our global message to the world.

Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, dignity, fairness and equality in the workplace. In recent times, there have been a number of alarming allegations and reports of sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace relating to the arts community. While all workplaces are obliged to comply with employment legislation, I have identified a number of actions that I can take as Minister in respect of the bodies reporting to my Department. The intention is to help boards under the aegis of my Department fulfil their functions more effectively and to support them in ensuring that policies on equality and respect in the workforce operate effectively and in line with best practice. These actions include arranging separate dedicated governance workshops for board members and senior staff, with a particular emphasis on issues relating to bullying, abuse of power and sexual harassment in the workplace; working on a collaborative basis with the Arts Council to make similar training available to other cultural organisations and arts centres around the country at a series of regional information days; highlighting once again to bodies reporting to the Department the nature of their legal obligations by seeking assurances of their compliance with obligations under employment legislation; and accelerating a planned review of compliance by bodies reporting to the Department with the requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. I am confident that these support measures will contribute to the further enhancement of existing governance structures in bodies reporting to my Department.

This is important, and I acknowledge that the Government appeared to go to some lengths to distance itself from the controversies that erupted around the Gate Theatre and the National Museum of Ireland. Cultural institutions and our other national institutions must have that oversight from the Minister and her Department. It would be most helpful to have measures in place in this regard because, as Deputy Burton quite rightly pointed out, if there is no way to support the board and if the facility is not in place for those affected to address these matters, there is nowhere for people to go or speak out. It is such a pity that a young woman had to go on social media before her voice was heard and acted on.

All workplaces are obliged to comply with employment legislation. Legally, the boards of national cultural institutions and agencies are responsible for good governance practice. However, it is my intention to help boards fulfil their functions more effectively. I want to support them in ensuring that policies on equality and respect in the workforce operate effectively. As I said, I am meeting the leaders of the theatres on Thursday. I want to hear from them and work with them in order to hear their issues and hear how they feel this issue can be satisfactorily addressed. We must change the culture in these organisations. That is the most important thing.

We cannot wash our hands of it. Was the Minister aware of the findings of wide-scale harassment reported in a survey by Irish Equity last year? SIPTU arts officer, Karan O'Loughlin, told RTÉ "News At One" that SIPTU went to the Arts Council as early as 2016 to ask it to help SIPTU to deal with the bullying and harassment in the sector by connecting funding to robust anti-bullying procedures, and the Arts Council refused. It says it was not its business. After everything that has transpired over the last two weeks, it is our business to have supports in place so that this does not happen.

It states that 60% of people who work in the arts work in a freelance manner and those two issues are by no means unrelated because the precarious nature of work within the arts means there is undue employer power and as a result there is exploitation of workers. It seems that the Minister is becoming the Minister for outsourcing responsibility.

I welcome it and that we can focus on the well-being of our citizens with the Creative Ireland programme as well as focusing on our identity as a nation, which is important for us and the arts community, for everyone to be able to experience that. Has the Minister had any update on progress across the country under Creative Ireland 2017?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	244	The Creative Ireland programme is a high level, high ambition, five-year initiative, which aims to place creativity at the centre of public policy. The launch document for the programme identified ten actions for 2017, under five specific pillars and there has been significant progress on their delivery. The position is as follows. Under pillar 1, my Department is finalising a draft of a Creative Children plan for the period 2018 to 2022 in conjunction with the Departments of Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council. I expect that will be launched later this year. With regard to pillar 2, culture teams have been established in each of the 31 local authorities and each local authority produced a culture and creativity plan for 2017. Each local authority is now in the process of drawing up five-year strategic creativity plans which will be published in early 2018. The first Cruinniú na Cásca was launched on Easter Monday with the theme inclusion and diversity and work is now under way to develop our approach to Cruinniú in 2018. A pilot scheme to assist self-employed artists who have applied for jobseeker's allowance was put in place by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection last June. Under pillar 3, my Department is finalising a capital investment programme for culture and heritage and has worked with the national cultural institutions on their plans under the programme. Work is progressing on the preparation of a plan for Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, television drama and animation in accordance with pillar 4. A unified international identity and communications programme for Ireland was rolled out under pillar 5. This includes a new portal website for Ireland, www.ireland.ie, which has been viewed more than 2 million times around the world.  A forum entitled, Culture, Wellbeing and the Creative Society, Building the Policy Agenda, will take place on 13 December in Dublin Castle. The forum will also be the platform to launch the European Year of Cultural Heritage in Ireland. The European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport will attend that conference. Huge strides have been made progressing the Creative Ireland programme in its first year and I look forward to building on this success in 2018.

The local authorities can bring those policies down to a local level. We saw that last year local authorities worked with communities. What communities can do when encouraged and given support is extraordinary. I looked at ireland.ie earlier and it is very good. There is scope to expand it and I imagine that is being considered. I would also like to ask the Minister to consider a report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in 2015, which examined the potential for job creation, innovation and balanced economic development in the creative economy where the tri-sector categorisation of the creative economy included creative expression, application and technology. It fits in perfectly to Creative Ireland.

The most important programme, which is rolling out shortly, is the creative children programme which, as the Deputy says, will encourage creativity in children. The aim is that, by 2022, every child will have access to tuition in music, drama, coding and art. It is important that we instill a love of art in young people. I was delighted that I was able to support a science festival through the Creative Ireland programme. When one sees how everything will be run by robots as we look forward, such as was shown at the science festival, we need to remember that we need somebody to programme them which requires creativity and thinking outside the box.That is what I want to encourage through our Creative Children plan. I believe this to be important.

Following on from my earlier comments about the local authorities and how crucial they are in delivering the cultural policy at local level, I wonder if it is something the Minister would see happening around the capital programme. I am thinking of the counties I am more familiar with such as Offaly for example, where we have the Birr Theatre and Arts Centre, the Dunamaise theatre in Laois, and the new amphitheatre in Cloughjordan, all of which have been very well funded by the Department over the years. They are receiving ongoing public funding. Does the Minister see any new programmes being brought forward to help them to innovate and develop their own infrastructure there?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	248	The arts and culture scheme, as the Deputy has said, has been very successful, as are the culture teams in the local authorities. The local authorities have been wonderful in putting together the culture teams and in the work they do. With regard to the arts and culture capital scheme, some €10 million has been awarded to more than 120 arts centres, theatres, galleries and performance spaces across the State. This is the largest investment in our local and regional arts infrastructure in a decade. Deputies will be glad to hear that 85% of the funding went to projects outside Dublin. The scheme links in very well with pillar 2 of the Creative Ireland programme, to enable creativity in every community. As the Deputy has pointed out, a number of projects in Laois-Offaly received funding: Birr Stage Guild Ltd. received €32,844 under strand 1; Teach Ceoil in Killeagh received €13,496 under strand 3; Laois arts centre received €20,000. I am aware the Deputy has been very supportive of all these local projects and the good news is that I have been able to secure additional capital funding in budget 2018. I hope to be in a position to invite applications for a further round of the scheme in the coming months.

It is about the Creative Ireland question. With regard to funding, the Minister said it is not a funding issue but I am aware of festivals that received funding through Creative Ireland. Through the simple guise of putting forward an expression of interest they received funding as part of their festival. The Minister cannot say there is not funding going out from Creative Ireland. Separate to the Arts Council and separate to anybody else the Minister's Department and Creative Ireland have been accepting expressions of interest and getting funding based on that. This has not been advertised anywhere.

is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national well-being. As the Deputy may be aware, the programme is based on five pillars: enabling the creative potential of every child, enabling creativity in every community, investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure, establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production and unifying our global reputation. The second pillar - enabling creativity in every community - is being implemented primarily through our local authorities. This is because local authorities are the primary instruments of community engagement and have a particular capacity for local programme delivery, especially in the context of citizen engagement. The culture teams already established in each local authority area under pillar 2 have put a considerable amount of work and time into producing local culture and creativity plans for 2017, which were published last May and included a long list of local cultural projects, events and initiatives taking place nationwide. An allocation of €2 million was made available - €1 million from my Department and €1 million from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to support the implementation of these plans. Each local authority is now in the process of drawing up more detailed five year strategic creativity plans, which will be published in early 2018. As part of this development, each culture team is hosting a variety of collaborative workshops, public meetings and discussions across the country to discuss its strategy and future cultural development as well as to listen and respond to local audiences. These strategies will be accompanied by a yearly culture and creativity action plan. I have already doubled my Department's allocation to the local authority programme in 2018 to €2 million and I look forward to working with the local authorities next year to build on the success of 2017.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	261	I thank the Minister for her reply. The Minister may remember that on her visit to Moate last Saturday, 5 November, there were a number of organisations we visited that day. One was the Moate Performing and Visual Arts Club. They put on a number of performances on that day and the Minister also visited a number of other key areas in Moate. It is important to note that the Minister is strongly living up to her ethos of developing the arts in rural settings and in making it more inclusive. The Moate Performing and Visual Arts Club has applied for funding under stream 3, which has a maximum cap of €20,000. The club is based in the Carmelite Centre in Moate and was set up in 1998. It fosters huge social inclusiveness and develops a number of key areas such as the Dancezone Stage School and the Moate Youth Theatre. The club brings young people onboard in very difficult circumstances. They do great work there and I would be grateful if the Minister could give an update on the stream measures. I also want to note that the teacher Sandra Julian and all her staff do huge work there.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	262	I have fond memories of my trip to Moate, the wonderful Moate Performing and Visual Arts Club and all the young people out and about on the Saturday morning. I remember it well. I know the area has a great local community arts group in them. I visited Moate during a trip to Westmeath last year and I was back in Moate again when the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring, and I launched the action plan for rural development. The Moate Performing and Visual Arts Club is a perfect example of what we want to see as part of the Creative Ireland programme. It is about young people and creative children who are engaging in the arts in our local communities. That is what I want to see. I am glad to tell the Deputy that the club has been awarded a grant of €16,557, under the final tranche of funding of stream 3 of my Department's arts and culture capital scheme. That will support them in putting in a new heating system - I have to admit that it was very cold there last Saturday morning - and to replace windows, along with other important work they need to do. I will make an official announcement later this evening about this funding, but I thought I would share it with Deputy Burke now.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	263	I thank the Minister for this update. That investment will be a huge asset to rural Ireland and the area covered by the club. The funding will be well spent. The club will get real value for money. They have huge interaction from the community and the club has put on huge performances in Moate. The community really comes out and shows support. I thank the Minister for her time in this case. I had previously advocated a number of times on this matter with the Minister in the Dáil. The Minister has been very forthcoming. These funding streams are essential for rural Ireland to give people a chance to engage in the arts and to ensure that young people receive a vital chance to get interested in the arts. As the society grows, this will stand to it, and as the economy improves it will also be a huge help to us. I thank the Minister for her time.

I wish to use this opportunity to clarify a point for Deputy Smyth. With regard to Creative Ireland, some funding was set aside to support various high profile and high impact events and initiatives. These were co-curated with key cultural partners and existing prestigious events to communicate and showcase the objectives of the Creative Ireland programme and to encourage increased engagement in creative pursuits across the State. Partnerships were entered into with a good number of events and festivals such as the Baboró international arts festival in Galway, which focuses on children; the Other Voices concert in Belfast; Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann in Ennis; the Dublin Theatre Festival; the Kinsale Sharks Festival and the National Ploughing Championships.These are national events and we benefit from our partnerships with them.

Currently, the short-stay ward is being used temporarily for rehabilitation service patients while refurbishments are carried out in the rehab unit in St. Conal's hospital campus. Previously, the short-stay ward was operating as a full ward of the hospital pending the reopening of the haematology-oncology ward, in which there were 11 beds, as well as the coronary care unit, which had eight beds. Those two wards opened in summer, following the flooding, and the beds and staff from the short-stay ward transferred to the two newly-opened wards. That meant the short-stay ward was vacant. Since then, it has been used for rehabilitation patients who are due to return to St. Conal's by the end of December when the ward will, once again, be vacant and available for use. To bring the short-stay ward into use to provide the 20 beds requires staffing. In June 2017, hospital management in Letterkenny submitted a request to the HSE for approval for the staff required to open the short-stay ward and provide the additional 20 beds. If open, the ward would enhance the hospital's capacity from 330 patients to 350. To bring that about, funding of €1.8 million was sought to hire 17 additional nurses, six health care assistants and four other staff. As the Minister of State knows from his work in the Department of Health, it takes time to put staff in place. Once approval is secured, it takes weeks or months to get to a situation where beds can be reopened. It usually takes at least four months. Nevertheless, Letterkenny has still not received approval from the HSE or, in particular, from the Government, which is responsible for providing the funding to the HSE to enable that to happen. As a result, 23 patients are waiting on trolleys for admission to Letterkenny University Hospital today. Yesterday, there were 25 such patients. Since January 2017, 4,000 patients have had to wait on trolleys for access to a hospital bed. They were admitted by accident and emergency department consultants but no beds were available on 4,000 occasions so far this year. That is an increase from 2016, when just over 1,200 patients were obliged to wait on trolleys. As such, the numbers increased almost two and a half times between 2016 and 2017. The hospital's assessment shows that, on average, approximately 20 additional beds are required at a given time. The proposal put forward would deal with that and provide the additional beds. However, that will only happen if the Government gets its act together and provides the required funding. Why has the Minister of State sat on this for the last number of months? Even if the funding is given now, we will have to wait a further period because of the inaction of the Government regarding the approval. Can the Minister of State inform the House today whether the funding will be provided immediately and state that every effort will be made to ensure the additional 20 beds will be available at Letterkenny University Hospital after Christmas for Donegal patients?
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	268	I thank Deputy McConalogue for raising this important matter. First, I am delighted that as part of the budget 2018 announcements, €40 million in additional finding was provided for winter pressures in 2017 and a further €90 million for measures to improve access to scheduled and unscheduled care in 2018. As such, we are planning for these particular issues. This is a signal of the commitment of the Government to invest in hospital services, provide additional supports during the winter period, increase hospital capacity and reduce waiting times for hospital procedures. The additional funding for winter preparedness will be allocated to a range of measures. I confirm that €5 million of the funding for 2017 will be focused on supporting patients to return home, or to an appropriate community setting where clinically appropriate, by providing 45 additional home-care packages and 20 additional transitional care beds per week over the winter period. These measures have already been rolled out to targeted hospitals nationally, thus helping to alleviate some of the pressures hospitals are experiencing at present. Funding will also be provided to increase bed capacity this winter and, moving forward, as part of service planning for 2018. The Department of Health is also undertaking a health service capacity review in line with the programme for a partnership Government commitment. The review's findings, which are due to be published before the end of the year, will provide an evidence base regarding future capacity. In addition, I confirm to the Deputy that all hospital groups and community health organisations have developed and put in place integrated winter preparedness plans for their localities with a focus on planning for periods of escalation, maintaining patient-flow processes and ensuring public health preparedness. I will turn to the question raised regarding Letterkenny University Hospital. I am aware that a proposal for additional beds in Letterkenny has been submitted to the HSE by the Saolta hospital group. This proposal will be assessed by the HSE in line with current financial and procurement processes and a decision will be made thereafter. In general, there is no doubt that too many patients continue to wait on trolleys for admission to hospital on a daily basis within our health service. I acknowledge the distress that long wait-times in emergency departments cause for patients and their families, including in Letterkenny. The public hospital system is seeing a growing demand for care and Letterkenny follows this trend. This year, accident and emergency attendances at Letterkenny had increased by more than 1% by the end of September, including an almost 5% increase in emergency department attendances by people over 75 years. Notwithstanding the pressure on Letterkenny emergency department, it is worth noting that patient experience times in Letterkenny are above the national average, meaning that patients complete their episode of care more quickly in Letterkenny emergency department. I compliment and thank the staff for that. I conclude by noting the commitment of this Government to develop and improve services at Letterkenny University Hospital as evidenced by the significant level of investment in capital projects in recent years. These developments include multiple remedial works following flooding in 2013, a new state-of-the-art blood science laboratory in 2015 and a new medical academy and a clinical skills laboratory, both of which were opened last year.

It beggars belief, however, and is unacceptable. First, I emphasise the tremendous work the staff at Letterkenny University Hospital perform on a daily basis. It is completely unfair that their work and effort is met, as it has been in the Dáil this evening, by the absolute failure of the Government to get to grips with its responsibility to ensure the planning and support is in place so that they can do the job they do their best to perform every day.The Minister of State said he is delighted that €40 million is available to ease the pressure on hospitals. He also said he is aware that a proposal for additional beds in Letterkenny had been submitted to the HSE and that this proposal would be assessed by the HSE in line with current financial and procurement processes, with a decision made thereafter. The HSE and the Government have had this proposal since June. We are in the middle of winter and the Minister says it will be assessed and considered as part of due process. He said he wishes to acknowledged the distress from long waiting times for patients in emergency departments. We do not want the Minister of State to tell us that he acknowledges people's distress. We want the Government to deal with the matter in order to ensure that people are not distressed. The hospital in Letterkenny put forward a clear proposal to provide 20 additional beds which would greatly help deal with overcrowding and people having to wait on trolleys every day for admission. Fortunately, when the rehab patients return to St. Conal's after Christmas there will be the physical space in the hospital to provide those 20 beds. Not every other hospital in the country has that capacity. The Government, however, cannot get its act together - even after six months - to provide the funding required to put staff in place for this purpose. It is totally unacceptable.

I agree with the Deputy regarding the staff at the hospital and I compliment them. The patient experience at the hospital is above the national average and there are many examples of good practice. It is misleading to say that nothing is happening. A great deal is happening.

They were bewildered earlier in the weekend as to who advises the Taoiseach and who thought it would be a good idea for him to take a picture of himself putting a spoon into a dishwasher or shared pictures of his "Mr. Taoiseach" mug and another pair of the array of coloured socks he has been receiving from various companies. These were all photo stunts to convince the population that the Taoiseach has a personality and is one of us but all obliterated by the remarks made by the housing Minister and repeated at the party conference by the Taoiseach. It seems Fine Gael are homelessness deniers. The party's members were not willing to debate the most pressing social issue at the party conference, meaning that the main Government party was sending out the message "Crisis; what crisis?" This was followed, disgracefully, by a well-paid Government adviser, Mr. Skehan, whose services are paid for by the taxpayer, going on national radio to say that the poor will always be with us. It is quite incredible and these stark examples bring it home to people that nobody in the Government seems to care or to recognise the scale of this crisis. I will deal with the figures. The OECD is probably a good place to start when it comes to comparing figures. It estimates six core forms of homelessness. Most countries count some but not all of the core forms and Ireland uses the narrowest definition, only counting three out of six categories, while 18 out of 30 countries count more than that. Ireland only counts three: sleeping rough, emergency accommodation and homeless accommodation. The Irish system does not count people in institutions, such as the cancer sufferer in my constituency who is in a convalescent home and who cannot be released because he has nowhere to go. It does not count non-conventional dwellings, such as caravans or mobile homes, which are very common, sheds in back gardens or tents. It does not count people living temporarily in conventional housing with family and friends due to the lack of housing, which is probably most of the people we come across at our constituency offices. Very few of these are counted but if they were, the figures for homelessness would be multiples of what they are. The other sleight of hand was using two-year old figures - from 2015 - even though the rate of homelessness has almost doubled in two years. Even if all the figures the Government provided are accurate and we are in a great position by international standards, what comfort will that be to any person who is actually homeless tonight? Should the woman from Blanchardstown, which is my area and in the Taoiseach's constituency, who is bringing several children to three different schools from a bed and breakfast in Gardiner Street take comfort in the statement that we are doing well by international standards? This is an attempt to normalise homelessness and state that it is acceptable. This is what Mr. Skehan's comments were about. It is true that homelessness is an international phenomenon and that the Government adheres to a neoliberal philosophy which dominates many administrations. This philosophy states that public housing is to be minimised and spending on it is to be slashed. The right to a home does not count for anything any more. One trips over homeless people in America, the richest country in the world, but that is nothing to boast about. It is incredible that the Minister thinks it was apt to state this at his party conference. People now see the reality of the situation.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	277	I welcome the opportunity to elaborate upon the comments that were made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, at the weekend in respect of lreland's rate of homelessness and to clarify the technical issues associated with making international comparisons. The Taoiseach is very well informed about the situation relating to housing and homelessness. He has immersed himself fully in our Department's brief, along with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in the past number of months and has attended a housing summit. He has worked with the Minister to ensure that we get extra money, with over €500 million allocated in the budget. We have secured over €6 billion of taxpayers' money to spend on this matter in the years ahead. The spend next year will be close to €2 billion. The Taoiseach is very well informed and very much aware that the position is not acceptable. The Taoiseach and the Minister are correct that Ireland's rate of homelessness is low by international standards, including among EU member states and by comparison to our nearest neighbours. It is also important to acknowledge that bringing clarification to this issue is not to suggest that any excuses are being made for the number of households that are currently without permanent accommodation. Let me be crystal clear: the levels of homelessness we are currently experiencing in this country, including recent increases, are absolutely unacceptable. No one is disputing that and the Taoiseach, the Minister, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, and I have said it repeatedly.The figures are there for everyone to see and no one is hiding from this. We have consistently said we will spend money on fixing this over a period but we cannot fix it in a week. We are certainly not hiding from the facts. It is not good enough that more than 3,000 children are without permanent homes, that families are residing in hotels or that individuals are sleeping on the streets of our cities. However, neither is it acceptable to hear commentators talking down our country. Over the past two years we have seen this narrative reflected in the national media. It has been claimed that homelessness in Ireland is at its worst since the Famine and that we have a crisis that is the worst in Europe. Assertions have been made to the effect that homelessness in Ireland is at such crisis levels that we should be excused from the requirements of EU law in responding. Some of this narrative has seeped into international coverage of our housing system, and it is damaging to Ireland’s international reputation that our social response to this issue is being portrayed as dysfunctional. As Teachtaí Dála we have a responsibility in this regard, and the good work being done in difficult circumstances needs to be recognised. We compliment the good work that is being done through all our local authorities, housing agencies, approved housing bodies and NGOs working in the sector, which spend a great deal of money tackling this issue. Some of it is taxpayers' money but some they raise themselves. They work night after night to provide services to people who are homeless and to help us find solutions for them. We cannot consistently undermine the great work they do. There are a number of readily available international comparative studies on homelessness, which illustrate Ireland's position in this regard. One such report is that produced recently by the OECD, which sees Ireland in the top tier of 30 international nations. One of the most comprehensive EU comparisons ever carried out by the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless found Ireland to have one of the lowest rates of homelessness among member states. Of course, these comparisons need to be contextualised. Direct international comparisons are difficult because of the availability, type, quality and consistency of data in different countries. Some commentators say this lack of international uniformity means that we should not view Ireland’s favourable position in a positive light. However, Ireland is a world leader in the production of consistent and timely quality data. The homelessness data that is available for Ireland is not contested by our homeless services sector, as it is for many other nations where governments are accused of ignoring homelessness or underplaying the figures, which we certainly do not. When we accept the fact the data available for Ireland is timely, consistent and comprehensive then we can understand that, even despite the definitional variations that may arise in comparisons, it is clear that Ireland’s homeless rate is not extraordinary, and is actually considerably lower than many other countries that are comparable in socioeconomic and cultural terms. I will now provide a direct comparison between our homeless rates and those in England and Scotland. These two nations also put considerable effort into monitoring homelessness and producing data, and so a direct comparison is possible. Based on the most recent reports, which were for September, there are 8,374 individuals, men, women and children, residing in emergency accommodation. These individuals equate to approximately 4,600 households. Based on census data from 2016, we had a national population of 4.76 million, broken down into 1.7 million households. A household can be a single person living alone or two or more persons living together.

As I explained at the outset, Ireland uses fewer categories when it comes to evaluating homelessness. The figures for the UK, our nearest neighbour, refer to the number of households applying for housing assistance to local authorities. Such households are accepted as being in the statutory homelessness category during the year of reference. We do not do this. The figures of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government do not count rough sleeping either. Perhaps they are added somewhere else but they are not counted officially on the Department's website. It only deals with those in emergency accommodation. We could argue until the cows come home, but everybody knows that 464 public houses were built last year. In the 1970s, 8,000 or 9,000 were routinely built each year. This morning, as people got up, they were told that house prices are to increase by 20% in the next couple of years because there is no affordable housing and there is not enough housing for the growing population. The Minister of State can argue all he likes. What was most pertinent about the comments the Taoiseach made at the weekend is that they revealed a real belief. They were backed up later by Mr. Skehan, who is a Government adviser. How can we have somebody heading up the Housing Agency who thinks the poor will always be with us and that we should not get emotional about homelessness? I wish he would tell that to the people I meet every day in the Dublin West constituency, which is a black spot for homelessness because of our young migrant and very transient population. People do not have anywhere to live. The Minister of State also mentioned the census. Huge numbers of young people aged under 30 are stuck at home. Almost 500,000 of them cannot get out from under their parents' feet and create independent lives for themselves. They are not counted as being homeless either, but they are also in housing need. We were told it would take 40 years to clear the housing waiting list if we wait for the Government, with its neoliberal philosophy, and capitalism to solve the problem. A complete change is required. We need an alternative whereby people who believe in public housing are in control.

In England, the figure is 3.45 homeless households for 1,000. The figure for Scotland is higher again. The Deputy is right to say that the number of those rough sleeping in England, namely, 4,134 people, is also very high. When the census was taken, the figure in Ireland was 123. The count of rough sleepers taken twice a year estimates the number approximately 130 or 140. It might be slightly higher. We try to monitor this figure, deal with it and be very clear.

We are not saying that it is acceptable. I want to be absolutely clear on this. Speaking about international comparisons does not in any way try to excuse or normalise homelessness. That is not what this is about. We have put in the resources to fix it. The Deputy, the committee and many others wanted the Government to commit to 10,000 social houses a year. This is exactly what we are doing. The money is being ring-fenced to deliver 50,000 social housing units over the next couple of years. In addition, we also provide many temporary solutions through the HAP scheme and RAS. Per working day, approximately 85 people are given housing solutions. Next year, the figure will be approximately 100. In the year gone by, more than 3,000 people left an emergency homeless situation and went into a house. We are making some progress. We say every week that we know it is not enough and we have to do more. We have put more money into it and we are trying many new measures, including direct build, leasing, acquiring vacant properties and bringing empty properties back into use. We will do all we can to intervene in the market to increase the supply of housing. Please do not keep telling me that we do not care or that we are not trying. Next year, €2 billion, which is a lot of money, will be spent on this. We are making inroads.

The N62 is a critical artery through Offaly and the midlands. It links the M6 at Athlone and continues to the M7 at Roscrea and the M8 at Horse and Jockey. It is crucial that the road, which is a national secondary road, be maintained to the highest possible standard because we require it to ensure we can develop our social, economical and cultural offerings in the area. We need access to our power station, forestry and for industrial purposes. We need access to develop the rural economy. We have a very good business park in Ferbane, which has a food campus, and we need good access there. Unfortunately, some parts of the road are deteriorating, particularly in Ferbane as one heads out of the town towards the Gallen Priory nursing home. A significant piece of the road really and truly is in a dreadful state and needs to be upgraded. We then move onto the roundabout at Cloghan, which is in a particularly poor state. I understand a design has been drafted for public consultation. Good consultation will find an agreement on the design because a solution needs to be found. It is an unusual junction with five roads leading into it. Another measure is required at Boolinarig Cross, which is a very unsafe junction. The speed of traffic along that route means it is frightening to try to exit from those two routes onto the junction.A number of people are living along those two routes. There is a lot of agricultural activity and ordinary domestic activity along them. A total reconfiguration of that junction is required to help people to exit onto the N62. I understand there has been a little bit of work on it in the past. Agreements with landowners have been negotiated or are certainly in progress. It seems to me that this junction should be prioritised. Further south on the N62, there are concerns about access onto the N52 at Kennedy's Cross. Perhaps that could be examined as well. I want to impress on the Minister the importance of the N62 to west and south County Offaly. When I was on the midlands regional authority many years ago, we looked at a development plan for the midlands region. There seemed to be a drive to downgrade the N62 at that time. I am glad this did not happen. Along with the other councillors who were members of the authority, I fought to make sure the N62 retained its status as a national secondary route. If that status was allowed to deteriorate, it would be terribly damaging to those of us who live in the area. I must acknowledge that some excellent work has been done on the N62 between Cloghan and Ferbane in recent years. The hard shoulders on that stretch of the road are very narrow, however. I know it is particularly challenging because of the peat foundation. There have been occasions when large vehicles have been pulled off that road, in effect. That has not happened of late, thankfully, but it has been an issue in the past. I impress on the Minister the need to prioritise the N62 in the interests of the west Offaly area.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	288	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I appreciate the importance she attaches to the development of the roads in her locality. When I visited the area recently, the Deputy helpfully and kindly showed me the dangerous roads in respect of which measures are needed. We will look seriously at such measures. As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I am responsible for overall policy for and funding of the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. The assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII within its capital budget and in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act 1993. Ireland has a road network of just under 100,000 km. The maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer. The national financial position led to large reductions in the amounts of Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure in the years of financial crisis. For this reason, there has been a focus on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvements in recent years. I envisage that the emphasis on maintaining current assets will continue into the next capital plan period. The 2016-21 capital plan, Building on Recovery, and the capital plan review allocations mark a significant step forward in restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady-state condition and allowing for some investment in road improvement schemes. The allocations and planned projects for the first years of the proposed ten-year capital investment plan will align with the existing capital plan as supplemented as part of the capital plan review. I understand from TII that it has invested approximately €8.3 million in upgrade works on the N62 in County Offaly since 2012. Additional funding of €369,000 has been provided by TII for road safety improvement schemes on the route. I accept the Deputy's argument that this is not enough. I acknowledge that further great improvements are needed on this road. After ten years of retrenchment, there are many potential national, regional and local road improvement projects across the country. The scope for progressing new road improvement projects will depend on the capital funding allocated to the Department under the proposed ten-year capital investment plan. As there are many competing demands, the appraisal and prioritisation of projects in line with the requirements of the public spending code and the Department's capital appraisal framework will be central to assessing which suitable major and minor national road projects can be advanced. We will bear in mind the high priority the Deputy has attached to this road and the excellent case she has made for it this evening.

The Minister will appreciate the importance of this project in light of his recent visit to the area. I remind him, in the context of the specific improvement grants he mentioned in his response, that many roads in west and east Offaly are built on peat foundations. According to the guidelines on the rehabilitation of roads over peat, such roads require works to be carried out on them four to five times more often than roads that are not founded on peat. We can see as we traverse the county that the current funding allocation is not really sufficient to cover all the roads built on peat foundations. I can clearly see the deterioration in roads built on cutaway bogs. I would also like to take advantage of the Minister's presence by mentioning the inner relief road that is required in Edenderry. He will be aware of the work that Offaly County Council has put into this 1 km stretch of road. It is ready to proceed. I would also like to mention the R400 from Rhode to Portarlington, which is part of the link between the M6 and M7 motorways. Rhode business campus is accessed from this strategic route. I would appreciate it if the Minister could look at the question of peat foundations and impress on those who are carrying out our policies that extra funding is needed in County Offaly for these purposes.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	290	The Deputy was present in Edenderry recently when a comprehensive presentation was made to me about peat foundations. The relief road was also highlighted on that occasion. It is imprinted on my mind because I have come across it twice in recent weeks, thanks to the Deputy and her colleague, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan. I will bear it in mind. I appreciate what Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has said on the issue of peat foundations. I know there is a greater need. The permanence of roads built on peat foundations is extremely questionable. I am happy to acknowledge what the Deputy is saying. Her colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, was there for that presentation as well. In her opening statement, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy mentioned a junction, the name of which I am afraid I cannot remember because the Deputy took me on rather a rollercoaster ride through west and south Offaly. If there is a safety issue, that is certainly a matter of great priority. That will always be an issue I will consider very seriously. If the Deputy can point particularly to road fatalities, I will certainly bring the matter to the attention of TII, which is making road safety a priority above everything else on the instigation of many people in this House and my Department.

A public meeting was held last night in County Offaly to highlight an issue that has become an epidemic nationwide, unfortunately. I will give two small examples from my constituency. In recent months, there have been eight break-ins at people's homes across an area from Clones, County Monaghan to Mountain Lodge, County Cavan. These crimes happened in broad daylight, generally between early morning and lunchtime. The last of the break-ins in question affected the McGinn family. Luckily, the children were at school when this happened. This young couple had left their house earlier that day to go somewhere. When they came back at lunchtime, they found three men - criminals - ransacking their home. They arrived at the back door to find a man standing there with a hurley stick, ready to attack whoever got in his way.Again in the Cootehill area, the home of a couple in their early 70s was one of 16 homes and businesses that were broken into in the past number of weeks. Criminality is on the rise. That particular couple had to barricade their farm machinery and equipment and almost barricade themselves into their home and farmyard. On three occasions during the past couple of weeks, that one farmyard and house was broken into, with attempted robbery on one occasion while equipment was stolen on two occasions. A total of 16 homes and businesses within an eight-mile radius of Cootehill were affected. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has just left the House. He was lucky enough to get Stepaside Garda station reopened. The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht represents this constituency and Cootehill is her home base. Cootehill Garda station has restricted opening hours. It is not a 24-hour station. It borders Cavan and Monaghan. Given the statistics I am providing, which are factual, we need that station to be open on a 24-hour basis. Garda resources are starved in this area and we need them to be replenished.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	293	Rural crime is definitely increasing regardless of statistics. The people on the ground will tell one that. Hundreds of people have attended meetings throughout the constituency of Offaly. We have had meetings in Cloghan and Banagher and there was a meeting last night in Coolderry attended by over 200 people in solidarity with Richie McKelvey, the farmer who was savagely attacked. This is spiralling out of control. We need resources. People are living in terror. There are reports of farmers bringing firearms into their bedrooms at night in order to protect themselves. There will be an escalation of this. We need more gardaí on the ground. We do not need to hear about the reopening of Templemore. We want to see the results of that. We want to see more gardaí patrolling and protecting rural communities. We also want to see part-time stations turned into full-time stations. One example is Edenderry, a big town in north Offaly with a growing population. The Garda station is open on a part-time basis, which is a disgrace because we are seeing increasing crime in that town. It involves rural crime and crime throughout our towns and villages. We need to tackle it head on and we need our Garda stations to be reopened but we also need a strong Garda presence on the ground.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	294	I thank the Deputies for raising this very important issue. I assure the Deputies that An Garda Síochána carefully monitors the activities of criminal groups affecting all areas of the country and is implementing strong policing measures to disrupt and dismantle their networks. The Deputies will appreciate that it is the Garda Commissioner and his management team who are responsible for the deployment of Garda resources, including personnel, to specific areas. However, l am advised that Garda management constantly monitors the distribution of resources in light of crime trends and overall policing needs. The Deputies will appreciate that very significant resources have been provided to An Garda Síochána, including an overtime allocation of €100 million announced in budget 2018 to support large-scale policing operations, including Operation Thor. It is also worth noting that Operation Thor has now entered its winter phase, which will run from 29 October 2017 to 1 April 2018. The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property crime under Operation Thor has led to concentrated Garda activity resulting to date in over 92,040 targeted checkpoints and 71,700 crime prevention patrols nationwide. This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 6,130 arrests and 6,920 charges covering a range of offences, which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen properly, possession of firearms and drugs offences. In addition, Operation Thor has targeted mobile criminal gangs engaged in burglary and related crimes and it is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend. The Deputies will be aware that the CSO official recorded crime statistics for 2016 show a decrease in burglary offences of 30% when compared to the previous 12-month period in 2015. This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor. Furthermore, crime prevention officers actively engage with community groups to promote the Safer Communities campaign and advise residents of ways to increase their personal safety and secure their property. I listened with care to what the Deputies said this evening, particularly to what Deputy Smyth said about her area of Cavan and Monaghan and to what Deputy Nolan had to say about County Offaly. I acknowledge the horrific and totally unacceptable assault on Richie McKelvey in south Offaly and offer my condolences and the condolences and sympathies of Deputy Corcoran Kennedy on what was an unacceptable act. We are in constant contact with An Garda Síochána to ensure those responsible for these unacceptable acts are brought to justice.  As part of the concerted strategy to combat burglary, the Government has made it a priority to secure the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015. The provisions are now available to gardaí to support prosecutions arising from Operation Thor. Furthermore, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act, has commenced. This Act introduced the DNA database, which provides gardaí with investigative links, or hits, between people and unsolved crimes, including burglaries. It is anticipated that this will assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years. I assure the Deputies that I take these issues extremely seriously and that under my watch, I will ensure, as Minister for Justice and Equality in conjunction with An Garda Síochána, that there will be no hiding place in any part of rural Ireland for people engaged in criminal activity.

However, I must say that the McGinn family in Mountain Lodge and the McPhillips family in Kill do not feel the benefits of Operation Thor. The McGinns were faced with a criminal standing at their back door with a hurley in his hand and had to wait 40 minutes for a Garda car to come from Carrickmacross, which is in a different county. As I said earlier, Cootehill Garda station has restricted hours so there was nobody available at that time and the McGinns had to wait 40 minutes for a Garda car to arrive. Three hours later, those criminals were seen crossing the Border into a different jurisdiction and had not been apprehended at any point in their spree of break-ins from Clones to Mountain Lodge in County Cavan. Operation Thor certainly does not hold any weight for those people at the coalface. I compliment the Minister on the CCTV scheme, which has huge potential. However, from working with community groups on the ground, I am hearing that the application form is cumbersome. There are restrictions around Garda stations and council buildings in the community. The communities affected by this such as Ballyhaise and Bailieborough do not have council offices for monitoring and storing data. The scheme needs to be rolled out in a more fluid way so that communities can access the funding. They badly need it and are willing to work and supply the application form. I appeal to the Minister to make it easy for them. 
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	296	I recognise the setting up of the task force as a positive step but far more needs to be done. We have operations that only target motorways but we have heard reports that these criminals are now using back roads into communities. Communities just do not feel safe. Their confidence has been shaken. If we look at the reporting of agricultural crime, we can see that 45% was not reported. That clearly shows a lack of confidence in the system and that people are almost giving up and despairing. People in rural communities are not asking for anything to which they are not entitled. We want a fair chance and fair play. We want our gardaí on the ground, as it used to be when gardaí were visible and were always present or when local gardaí also acted in the community and struck up a great rapport with those communities. We are calling for that to be restored. We are calling for these communities to receive fair play. I ask the Minister to call for increased numbers of gardaí because they are warranted.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	311	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." This Bill is about saving lives. I am introducing to the House a short but very important Bill. It is designed to address a specific failing in our current legislation on drink-driving. We all know that alcohol and driving do not mix. Drink driving is one of the most serious causes of collisions, injuries and fatalities on our roads. No one disputes that. There is also general agreement that the law must be firm on drink-driving. It must take drink-driving seriously and it must be seen to take it seriously. It is now seven years since the law on drink-driving was comprehensively revised and updated. The legislation involved - the Road Traffic Act 2010 - has generally served us well. It provides a framework of graded offences. At the most serious are cases where people are, as the law states, under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of controlling the vehicle. These are cases where a person has drink or drugs taken and can be proven to be impaired and unable to control the vehicle. Also serious, but a lesser offence, is being over a specified limit of alcohol. In this case, the offence is driving or being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while over the alcohol limit. There is no requirement to prove impairment. One of the big controversies in 2010 was that the alcohol limit was being lowered. We were told this was excessive and that it would destroy social life in the country. It was not and it has not. On the contrary, lower alcohol limits have contributed to saving lives and have helped to impress on people the dangers of drinking and driving. Even a small amount of alcohol can impact on driver’s reaction time and hazard perception. While drivers in this situation may not have obvious impairment, the impact of alcohol on their reactions could be the difference between life and death. The law on drink-driving which we introduced in 2010 contains a significant flaw. There was a general principle which was supposed to apply to drink-driving and to all serious road traffic offences. Committing a serious offence was destined to lead to a period of disqualification from driving. In spite of this principle, it was decided in 2010 - to appease publican lobby groups - to allow some drinkers found over the legal limit to escape disqualification. This is a tragic mistake. Such appeasement of a powerful lobby, such as the publicans, cannot be right. Either any drink-driving over the legal limit is a serious matter or it is not. If it is, how can we not have a disqualification? We disqualify people who drive dangerously or carelessly. We disqualify people for driving dangerously defective vehicles. We disqualify people for dangerous parking during lighting up hours. Ireland has had a mixed record in recent years. We even disqualify people for driving without insurance. What possible rationale can there be for saying to some people who drive while over the legal alcohol limit that we are not going to disqualify them? Do we really mean to say that a person driving on a road while over the alcohol limit is less of an immediate danger to public safety than someone who is parking dangerously? Are they posing less of a danger to public safety than someone who has no insurance? The fact that it is only some people in this position who get the exemption from disqualification serves to underline the fact that driving when over the limit merits disqualification. The law already recognises that this offence should normally attract disqualification. There is no logic to the proposition that in some cases some people should get a waiver on the disqualification and be allowed to pay a €200 fine, get three penalty points and drive on as if nothing had happened. I will put this issue in a broader context. It is almost a cliché in the area of road safety that there are many factors involved and many different measures needed in order to promote road safety. It is a cliché because it is true. Ireland’s current road safety strategy, as its predecessors, sets out actions across a whole range of areas which must be addressed if we are to achieve what we all want, which is to make our roads safer and to reduce deaths and injuries on our roads. Deputies will know that Ireland has a mixed record in the last few years on road safety. For a good many years road deaths were dropping from the peak of 472 in 1997 to the historic low of 162 in 2012. Since then, we have seen fluctuations. There was a significant increase in 2013, a smaller increase in 2014, a drop to 162 in 2015 and an increase again in 2016. Current indicators are of a very welcome drop in the number of deaths for 2017 with today’s figure standing at 133, which is 31 fewer fatalities than the same period in 2016. That is still 133 too many. Many of the major issues to be addressed have been addressed. The NCT has helped to ensure vehicle standards are higher and driver training has improved. The introduction of penalty points in 2002 and the strengthening of the penalty points system have all had an impact on people's behaviour. Many more measures are in train under the road safety strategy and will continue to be so in the future. Road safety, as I have said many times, should not be a matter of politics or of ideology. It should be an issue that crosses party lines. We all agree on the goal of making our roads safer and most of the time we agree on the means. There are debates and disagreements, but they are over practicalities, whether a particular measure will work, or how it can be made to work better. For the many factors involved in road safety and in road deaths, we must have many measures, which we do. The road safety strategy continues to address vehicle standards, driver education and enforcement. In all of these areas we need and do have continuing efforts, not least because as the number of road deaths has gone down, the causes behind those remaining deaths are more intractable. Drink-driving has always been one of the major factors in road traffic collisions. The RSA has found that alcohol is a factor in 38% of road deaths, a figure which is based on coroners’ reports into road deaths. We should think about that figure of 38%. In spite of what we know about drink-driving and all of the public awareness campaigns, alcohol is still a factor in more than a third of road traffic deaths.Last year when the Irish Examiner and the ICMSA commissioned an opinion survey on this issue, almost 23% of those polled admitted to driving after three or more pints. I believe anyone would conclude that the real figure must be higher, if we include those who drink and drive but do not admit it. Even a figure of nearly 23% is disturbingly high. Particularly worrying is that research by the RSA and separate research by the AA have shown that drink-driving is increasing among younger drivers. That is a surprise but it is the truth. Drink-driving is not just dangerous; it continues to be a significant factor in road deaths in Ireland. It is a problem which is growing. Not many years ago it had become commonplace to say rather smugly that we were witnessing a culture change, that drink-driving was no longer socially acceptable. If that was true, it is not any longer. The trend is reversing and we need to get it back on course. How can we do so if the very law we make treats some drink-driving cases as not being serious enough to merit the smallest disqualification? The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 deals with one very specific and very important amendment. It will remove the provision of the Road Traffic Act 2010 - a provision which should never have been introduced - which allows some people who drive while over the alcohol limit to get away without any disqualification. This provision is bad in itself, because it treats a serious offence as if it is not serious. It is worse if we remember that it sends a message that the law does not take "a little drink-driving" seriously. Let me remind the House what the provision in section 29 of the 2010 Act states. Section 29 deals with drivers other than learners, novices, and professional drivers. Offences concerned with alcohol limits divide in seriousness according to the amount of alcohol a person has in his or her blood, breath or urine. Section 29 applies to people who have up to 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood or are in the equivalent brackets for breath or urine. Under section 29, these people are first served with a fixed-penalty notice, rather than with a summons to court. This offers an administrative system as an alternative to court proceedings, with which I have no difficulty. The problem arises with the consequences for drivers. Under section 29, if a person is between 80 and 100 mg per 100 ml they get a six-month disqualification. If they are between 50 and 80 mg per 100 ml, they can choose to accept three penalty points. Let us consider what this means. It takes 12 penalty points for someone to get a six-month disqualification. I am quite happy to accept that the consequence of being in a lower bracket of alcohol should be lower but the law as it stands provides that a person in the lower bracket is not automatically disqualified and gets three points, or a quarter of what it takes to reach a disqualification under the penalty point system. How can that be justified as a consequence of driving above the legal amount of alcohol taken? The Bill will remove this anomaly. In place of the relatively trivial three penalty points, there will be a three-month disqualification. This is a short period but it is a disqualification. It is short because it is in the lowest bracket of those over the alcohol limit. Anything less would simply say - as the law so regrettably does at present - that a little alcohol over the legal limit before driving is not a serious matter. The Bill has provoked a great deal of comment. It has been strongly supported by road-safety advocacy groups including the Irish Road Victims Association and the PARC Road Safety Group. The Road Safety Authority, the Automobile Association and Drinkaware have also been strongly supportive. A survey of public opinion conducted just after this proposal was announced found that 91% of the public supported the view that there should be automatic disqualification for all drivers detected driving over the limit. Deputies may be interested to note that these figures broke down into 93% in rural areas and 89% in urban areas. While there has been support from victims groups, road safety advocates and the public at large, there has also been criticism. Some of the initial criticisms were based on a misunderstanding, which has hopefully been cleared up. Some people seemed to think that the Bill would lower the alcohol limits further. That was never the intention and hopefully that message has been made clear. The Bill will not lower the alcohol limits; it will ensure proper consequences for people who breach the existing limits. There have been those who claimed that this Bill will not save a single life. They could not be more wrong. To give an idea of the scale of the issue, in the years from 2012 to 2016 inclusive, 3,003 fixed-penalty notices issued to drink-drivers in the 51 mg to 80 mg alcohol concentration bracket. This is the number of people facing the prospect of penalty points instead of a disqualification. Not only is it a significant number but there was a notable increase during 2016. This fits with other evidence of a reversal in the previous trend towards people seeing drink-driving as unacceptable. There is also the question of actual deaths. The RSA has found that between 2008 and 2012 at least 35 people died in collisions where drivers had alcohol levels at between 21 mg and 80 mg. Of these, 16 were in the 50 mg to 80 mg range. If we had taken drink-driving, even at what we call low levels, more seriously, these 16 people might be alive. How can people claim that ensuring proper consequences for drink-driving at these levels will not save lives? They may say that drink-driving is not the only issue, or that this Bill does not address every aspect of drink-driving, but no one ever claimed that it did. What it does is address a serious flaw in our current law. It will make sure that what is already illegal will carry the consequences it should. There is also the question of how we address the culture change we so badly need. This Bill alone will not solve the problem of drink-driving as a growing phenomenon but it will help a great deal to underline that drink-driving is never acceptable, and if we leave the law as it is, that law will continue to puncture arguments against drink-driving because the law of the land will continue to say that a little alcohol before driving is no great harm. Most of the opposition to this Bill has, as Deputies will by now be aware, come from people who argue that it will somehow undermine social life in rural areas. The Bill has been presented as an urban versus rural issue. None of this stands up to examination. I have already mentioned the survey which found overwhelming support across the country. This is not surprising; rural Ireland has suffered disproportionately from alcohol-related road deaths. Some 81% of alcohol-related road deaths occur in rural Ireland. Those who portray this Bill as an attack on rural Ireland are missing the point. We want to save lives in rural Ireland. When the alcohol limit was being lowered in 2010, many of the same arguments were put. The fundamental mistake of those critics who say that this Bill will damage rural Ireland is that they are conflating two very different issues. One is drink-driving, which is a public safety issue, and an issue on which I want to protect the public everywhere, in all areas, rural and urban. The other and entirely separate issue is the problem of social isolation in rural Ireland. These two issues are different and those who would treat them as one issue do a disservice to both. We know that rural Ireland does not have the concentration of public transport that more densely populated areas do. The Government fully appreciates that there is a particular problem as people get older in socialising in rural Ireland. The Government has decided to explore ways of addressing social isolation in rural areas. I invited a wide range of organisations, State, private and voluntary, to meet me in September to explore ways in which we can address the problem of social isolation in rural Ireland. I am happy to say that there was a broad shared agreement on the problems and that a number of initiatives in this area are now being explored. I have already invited the stakeholders to a second meeting this month. I wish to bring to the attention of Deputies my intention to introduce on Committee Stage amendments to strengthen the law with regard to learner drivers who are driving unaccompanied by a qualified person. There is strong support in the House for the strengthening of the law in this area and for the commencement of section 39 of the Road Traffic Act 2016, which for legal reasons I have been unable to commence. I am confident that I will finally be in a position to commence this section with the amendments I am proposing and to introduce a law which is robust and enforceable. I want to bring to an end the all-too-common practice of learner permit holders driving unaccompanied by a qualified person. I shall also bring forward an amendment to assist An Garda Síochána in dealing with unaccompanied learner drivers by amending section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, which allows the Garda to detain, store, release or dispose of vehicles in certain circumstances. These include cases where the vehicle is untaxed or uninsured or where the driver has been disqualified. I intend to propose adding to these cases circumstances where the driver is an unaccompanied learner. This will be an effective tool in removing the immediate danger from the roads and will also be a strong deterrent to unaccompanied learner driving. I urge the House to support the Bill and in so doing to make our law on drink-driving more robust and our roads safer. It really is as straightforward as that. I ask the House to listen to the voices of the road-safety experts and the road-safety advocates and victims groups who have all strongly supported this proposal. Many of them are in the Gallery and I salute them. Some may say that there are other matters which need addressing and, of course, there are. Road safety is a goal we must and do pursue on a range of fronts and numerous initiatives are under way in line with the road safety strategy. However, how can we address any issue properly if we make laws which do not apply serious consequences to seriously dangerous behaviour?How can we expect drivers who would risk their own safety and that of others to be deterred if they know that the consequences would not be serious?  In the months leading up to the debate today members of road safety advocacy groups, people who have lost family members and friends in road collisions involving alcohol, have contacted many of the Members of this House to ask them to support this Bill. They know, from sad experience, that every life matters, that there can be no acceptable level of collateral damage where drink-driving is concerned. Their bravery in putting their own losses aside in order to work for the safety of others can only be hugely applauded. We talk of a need for culture change in regard to drink-driving, and rightly so. We cannot expect a change if the law itself does not step up to the mark. In an ideal world we would not have anyone acting so selfishly or so thoughtlessly as to drive after taking alcohol. Unfortunately, we do not live in that kind of world. There are people who would put themselves and others at risk. We already make that behaviour illegal. It is time the law made the consequences of that dangerous behaviour match the seriousness of the offence, and that is why I am asking all Deputies to support the Bill.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	312	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening. Before I begin my contribution, I, as my party's spokesperson for sport, would like to wish our national team the very best of luck in Lansdowne Road as it hopes to bring some goodwill and cheer to our country in its endeavours against Denmark. I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of families who have been bereaved as a result of fatalities on our roads. I salute their courageousness in the manner in which they have lobbied on this and on many other issues related to road safety, improving our legislation and reducing fatalities on our roads. We are all at one when we say we want to reduce the fatalities on our roads and reduce the number of people who have incurred serious injuries on our roads. That is the reason I welcome the opportunity to debate this legislation. It gives us an opportunity to improve our laws and to help reduce fatalities and serious injuries on our roads. The increase in the number of road fatalities in recent years is worrying and it needs to be addressed. In the period from 2015 to 2016 alone, we saw a 16% increase in the number of road fatalities. We had become accustomed to a downward trajectory in the figures and an element of complacency may have set in. Some have sought to portray my party as somewhat soft on drink-driving and on road traffic offences but let me be very clear, unambiguous and unequivocal, as a party, we totally condemn drink-driving. We are the party that in 2001 introduced the penalty point system, in 2005 introduced mandatory alcohol testing on our roads, in 2006 set up the Road Safety Authority, in 2009 introduced safety cameras on our roads, in 2010 introduced a graduated driver licensing system for learner drivers and in 2011 lowered the blood alcohol limit to 50 mg, a point which is sometimes lost in commentary. It is currently illegal to drive a car with a blood alcohol limit in excess of 50 mg and in excess of 20 mg for specified drivers. The reason it is illegal is that my party reduced that blood alcohol limit in 2010, which came into effect in 2011. I accept the Minister's bona fides and that he believes what he is proposing is the right measure and that it will reduce fatalities. The figures from which we are working and with which we were presented at the committee at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage date back to 2008 and to 2012. There is only one year in that period where the new measures introduced in 2010, namely, the imposition of a €200 fine and three penalty points, came into effect. In that same period over 50% of the fatalities on our roads were the result of drivers being found to be over four times the legal limit. We have no way in this Bill to address that. In that period a significant number of motorists were found to have had a blood alcohol level of over 80 mg. We are not addressing that nor the issues concerning pedestrians or cyclists. When I sought up to date figures from the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, in March, July and most recently in a parliamentary question in September, they were unavailable. The reason they are unavailable from the Garda Síochána is that unfortunately its members cannot stand over the figures they would produce today. That is not right or proper. It is certainly not right when we consider that more than 1 million fake breath tests are alleged to have been carried out. What we are being asked to support is a Bill based on figures that predominantly predate the introduction of the reduced blood alcohol limit in 2011. The up to date figures we have been given are preliminary and the other figures we have tried to get from the Minister when he appeared before the Oireachtas committee and by way of parliamentary questions are not available. What the Minister and my party differ on is not the fact it is illegal, because currently that is what is in law, but on the sanctions that apply to motorists found to have a blood alcohol level in excess of 50 mg. The Minister tells us, and other people advocate, that an automatic disqualification from driving is one way to go, that this is the only way we can get impaired drivers off our roads. The question I have asked the Minister repeatedly, which he has been unable to answer, is that if automatic disqualification is the only way to go, why in 2016, according to the figures he gave when he appeared before the Oireachtas committee, were 8,063 people arrested for driving while intoxicated. Of that 8,063, 7% were found to be in the category of having a blood alcohol level of 50 mg to 80 mg, 93% were in the category of having a blood alcohol level where they would have been liable to automatic disqualification straight away. If automatic disqualification was a deterrent, one would imagine those figures would be reversed. The real deterrent to people not taking a chance in this regard is to ensure we have a significant Garda presence on our roads. Unfortunately, this Government and the previous one have allowed a situation to transpire where the number of gardaí in the traffic corps have decreased by 40% since 2010. Unfortunately, the only way we can get impaired drivers out from behind the wheel of the car is the chance of them being caught, that is, by a car with a blue flashing light coming up behind them or at a checkpoint. That has not been happening. In 2016, the Garda initiated the Gillian Treacy campaign.In the month leading up to Christmas, there was a 34% reduction in the number of deaths compared with the corresponding period in 2015 and a 27% reduction from the corresponding period in 2014. If we had a greater Garda presence on our roads, I firmly believe we would get our impaired drivers off the road. I must ask the Minister the question as to who is running An Garda Síochána at present. It is a leaderless organisation. The Commissioner has stepped down and the acting Commissioner has indicated he does not want to be the Commissioner. In fact, he has already gone on a pre-retirement course. Who is in charge and who will ensure a sufficient number of people are working in the traffic corps? I understand the Crowe Horwath report has been presented to the Cabinet and that it calls for a review of the road traffic legislation with a view to streamlining and simplifying it where possible. The Garda Inspectorate also called for this in 2014, yet it has not been done. I also understand the report states it should not be used in any future process in respect of performance or disciplinary matters. Surely to God, the Minister, as a member of Cabinet, will ensure that senior members of An Garda Síochána will be held responsible for 1 million fake breath tests. I hope he does. This report also reveals that the five-shift system will be examined and that the hours of overtime will be cut by 33% in 2018. If that happens, we will see a smaller Garda presence on our roads, not a greater one. I believe that will lead to more fatalities. The Minister portrays this legislation cynically in suggesting it will make a huge difference. He portrays Fianna Fáil as being soft on the issue. For this small category, we do not believe it is proportionate, in that somebody who has done the right thing and who took a taxi home the night before but who may be marginally over the limit the following morning, having done everything right, could potentially lose his or her driving licence for three months. As a consequence of this, such people could lose their job, which would have a huge impact on their family. I listened to the Minister last Thursday night on "Prime Time", when he was questioned about the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and the call for him to resign from his position. The Minister said that what Deputy Halligan did was wrong and could not be condoned but that we must have proportionality in all aspects. We believe we need proportionality in this regard. I believe we need to send a strong message that this will not be tolerated and anybody caught in this category should be liable to a €500 fine and five penalty points.  I will make a number of other comments on the Bill. All Members will be afforded the opportunity to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage that will improve road safety. The Road Safety Authority has conducted an in-depth study on the role of alcohol in fatal road deaths. In eight out of ten cases, the blood alcohol level was over 100 mg. Nowhere in this legislation are we tackling that. In five out of ten cases, the blood alcohol content was over 200 mg. Nowhere in this legislation are we tackling that issue. I will table amendments on Committee Stage to ensure Irish law is brought into line with penalties that are in force across the Border in Northern Ireland and across the water in the UK. At present, it can take six months to notify the District Court of an offence. That is simply too long and should be reduced to a maximum of four weeks. People who are found guilty of breaking the law should be taken off the road immediately. That is an amendment that we will be proposing. I mentioned the need for greater enforcement. In his contribution today, the Minister did not allude to the fact that a great number of people were involved in fatalities when they should have been off the road in the first instance. Why is the situation allowed to pertain whereby disqualified drivers continue to drive a car? We do not have sufficient penalties in place. I am told that even though disqualified drivers are obliged to return their licences to the Road Safety Authority, 98% of them do not do so. That is a disgrace and it is no wonder we have so many disqualified drivers on the road. How can that be allowed happen in this day and age? People in that category should also see their penalty increased. The Minister was right to mention the worrying number of young people who are involved in fatal collisions and who feel it is okay to take the chance. We are not doing enough at an early stage to ensure that young people are educated on the dangers of drink-driving. While it is an optional module in transition year, we should engage with the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure that it is not optional but is a mandatory module to prepare children for when they take up driving at 17 or 18. This is an opportunity to tackle the scourge that is cyclists and the significant number of cyclists involved in fatalities this year. I intend to table an amendment that will ensure there is a minimum required passing distance for cars overtaking cyclists. I hope the Minister will support it. It should be mandatory for all cyclists to wear a helmet at all times. I have already discussed with the Minister the need for pedestrians to wear high-visibility jackets on unlit roads. That is another amendment which I will bring forward on Committee Stage. The Minister shares my concern and supported me when I raised the matter previously. This is an opportunity to address the issue. As we indicated last year, Fianna Fáil will support the amendment in respect of unaccompanied learner drivers. We indicated that we would do so 12 months ago.It has taken 12 months for the Bill to come to where it is but we will support it. Originally, the Minister anticipated the legislation would be brought before the Oireachtas in March or April 2017, it would be stand-alone and would be enacted without delay. I do not know for what reason the Minister was not able to bring it before the Dáil at that time. However, the intervening period has enabled our party to look at sensible amendments which can only enhance and improve road safety, as well as helping to reduce collisions, fatalities and serious injuries on our roads. As much as we can on this side of the House, we will support the Minister bringing this Bill to the next Stage. The only area on which we disagree is the proportionality of the offence. We will bring forward an amendment to ensure we signify it is wrong to commit an offence with a blood-alcohol concentration of over 50 mg per 100 ml.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	313	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017. My colleagues in Sinn Féin and I will support it. The Bill is designed to change the penalty for those found to be driving with a blood alcohol level above 50 mg and below 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. This is already an offence and the penalty is a fine along with three penalty points. The Bill does not propose to change the legal limits for drinking and driving. Only the penalty will change. We support the Bill because it sends a message that drinking and driving is wrong, dangerous and unacceptable. The State has a poor record of deaths on our roads. We have come a long way in the past decade in this regard. However, there has been a worrying trend in the past few years with the numbers of annual deaths due to road traffic accidents creeping up. One life lost on our roads is one too many. Sadly, over the past several years, the number of people dying on our roads has increased. There are many reasons for this, including poor roads, careless drivers, drink and drug driving and, perhaps most importantly, the slashing of the Garda Traffic Corps. In recent years, drinking and driving has become less acceptable. We need to work towards a society where drinking and driving is universally condemned. We are not there yet. This was clear in recent months from the attitude of public representatives, most notably from Fianna Fáil Deputies and rural Deputies in other parties, including the Minister's Government colleagues. This Bill is another step towards that aim. Drinking and driving is reckless and dangerous, and should be recognised as such under the law. A punishment of three penalty points does not relay that message. A short suspension of a driving licence does. Some Members have been jumping up and down over this Bill, claiming they are concerned about protecting rural Ireland. A Bill which seeks to impose harsher punishments on those caught drinking and driving is not an attack on rural life. Indeed, those most at risk of being killed in a collision where alcohol is a factor are those living in rural areas. I am sympathetic to those who live in rural and isolated regions of the State who do not have adequate access to transport links. It is an absolute disgrace and I have raised it on several occasions with the Minister. At the very least, 93,000 households do not have access to any public transport. There are parts of the State which do not have trains, public buses, local links or even a regular hackney or taxi service. These problems do not mean we should fill in the gaps with drink drivers. It is worth repeating that the matter at hand, namely, being found with between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml of blood is already an offence. Essentially, my colleagues are calling for the current situation where it would appear drink-driving in some areas is considered to be acceptable. It is never acceptable. If the current laws give the message that this is a reasonable situation, then we need to change them. The current penalty of three penalty points and a fine is apparently not getting the message across. The Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny at the transport committee. That process was hijacked by some committee members, as well as non-committee members who oppose the legislation, in their attempt to discredit the evidence presented by the Road Safety Authority. Those on both sides of the argument appeared before the committee. The only interest groups who gave evidence against the legislation were vintners' groups. Their reason for having an interest in this is obvious. To my colleagues who claim they oppose these matters because of rural decline, if the best method they can come up with to address that issue is to argue that rural people should receive a softer punishment for drink-driving, then to be quite frank, I despair. We can do much better than that. The only reason I can think for Fianna Fáil's and others' opposition to this Bill is that it is politically popular to do so. We know Fianna Fáil will take whatever position is politically popular at the time and its position changes as soon as public opinion does. It is quite disturbing that elected representatives care more about the votes of their constituents than they do about their lives or safety. We need to take a wider view of this. Politicians need to show leadership and do the right thing. There are many other measures which we can introduce to help people in rural areas. For years my party has called for an increase in spending on road maintenance in rural areas and expansion of the rural transport programme. The Bill is the only measure which the Minister has proposed, which is disappointing but not surprising. He needs to take an interest in rural Ireland, improving transport links and infrastructure. To date, he has shown no interest at all. Rural people are entitled to be able to travel safely and efficiently. These measures will not solve any of the problems faced by those who do not have access to adequate services. It may help to reduce drinking and driving, however. The Minister might be smiling but the fact is that 93,000 of rural households do not have access to any form of public transport whatsoever. Bills like these are not the most pressing issue facing the Minister. A more cynical person might even consider this to be a diversionary tactic. The Minister has busied himself with this matter, along with judicial appointments, since he took office. We all can agree there are bigger issues facing the Minister. If he is concerned about road safety, his first port of call should be to invest in infrastructure. Our roads have been underfunded for the past decade. This means that essential maintenance and repairs have not happened. At the Committee of Public Accounts some weeks ago, Transport Infrastructure Ireland stated the deficit was approximately €100 million. If our roads are not safe, then the people using them are not safe. Investing in our roads would be beneficial to those living in rural areas and would make our roads safer for everybody. I hope the Minister will take this matter seriously. When he first took office, he was told €3 billion was required to bring our roads to a steady-state condition. I have yet to see any significant movement on that. Over the past decade, personnel numbers in the Garda traffic corps have been halved.The Minister announced that additional personnel would be added to the corps but the increase was pushed back to the end of this year. Can the Minister indicate the number of new gardaí who have joined the corps in 2017? Has the 10% target been reached? Earlier in the year, he gave a commitment at a meeting of the transport committee that there would be a 10% increase in the number of gardaí in the corps. He pressed the issue in the latter part of the year. It is now November and Christmas is almost here. The usual road safety campaign will be rolled out for the Christmas period and things will go back to normal on 2 January. We do not only want optics this year. Can the Minister indicate whether he has yet allocated the 10% increase in the number of officers serving with the Garda Traffic Corps to which he committed? Last June, there were 663 members of the corps. In 2007, there were 1,200. The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, need to address that as a matter of urgency. All Members know how effective Christmas road safety plans are. They are successful because personnel and resources are deployed in respect of road safety for a period of weeks, with checkpoints, safety messages and advertisements to beat the band. If people know there is a good chance of coming across a Garda checkpoint, it is an effective deterrent to drink-driving and, therefore, an injection of resources into the traffic corps would ensure roads are safer for everybody. That is common sense. I raised with the Minister on several occasions that there are places in County Louth and across the State in which many people make a deliberate choice to drink and drive in the full knowledge and comfort that there is no chance of their meeting a checkpoint on the road. They go from home to the pub and from the pub to home without ever coming across a Garda checkpoint and, therefore, there is no deterrent. I appeal to the Minister, if he is serious about the issue, to roll out measures not just for three weeks over Christmas but to have them sustained throughout the year because the Bill alone is not sufficient. We still do not know the full truth of how the Garda breath test scandal came about or who was responsible. There has been no accountability whatsoever. Formulating legislation of this nature in a climate of what appears to be complete dysfunctionality is not ideal. To properly formulate legislation, we need access to correct information and data. At no stage have I heard the Minister put the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, under any pressure in a public arena to produce the data or, more importantly, to press for accountability and to hold those responsible for the scandal to account. It also appears that those who drafted the Bill did not have the data to hand. Introducing harsher penalties at a time when there are very serious questions to be answered by the Garda in respect of breath tests is not ideal. However, despite the Minister's many failures, I accept that this does not fall under his remit but, rather, that of the Minister for Justice and Equality. I support the Bill and hope the Minister will take my comments on board when he considers future steps regarding road safety.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	314	The Labour Party will support the legislation as it passes through the Houses. This is a short Bill that has been the subject of long debate in recent months. That is understandable because drink-driving elicits strong and passionate responses from people across the country. The Labour Party supports the Bill. I say that plainly because it is important that there be no ambiguity about the matter. There can be no condoning or making excuses for drink-driving or impaired driving due to alcohol intake. However, our support should not be taken as a signal that we believe the legislation is the silver bullet it has been presented as by the Minister. There is considerable scepticism as to whether legislation such as this is likely to have a significant impact, in particular if it is regarded as a stand-alone solution that will end drink-driving on our roads. The Minister should listen to such scepticism rather than painting as a defender of drink-driving anyone who dares to question his logic. Drink-driving is not the only cause of dangerous driving. Speeding is a major problem, as is using a mobile phone or tablet device while driving. Driving a car that is not roadworthy is an almost overlooked cause of accidents and poorly maintained roads contribute significantly to the problem. Those are all major issues that need to be further tackled in order to make our roads safer and to minimise the carnage thereon. The scepticism to which I referred exists because many Members do not believe there is sufficiently robust existing enforcement of road traffic legislation. Members know statistics produced by the Garda Síochána on the matter cannot be trusted, which further feeds such scepticism. The Labour Party believes there should be more enforcement of existing legislation but we need to be able to trust the enforcement, the statistics and the Garda. The breath test scandal has ruptured the trust in Garda traffic enforcement. It reinforced the view that the Garda is after figures and targets rather than apprehending those who are breaking the law and driving over the blood alcohol limit. One of the biggest bugbears for many is the placing of speed vans in areas with low speed limits, such as 50 km/h zones, to try to catch people driving at perhaps 52 km/h, 53 km/h or 54 km/h. I know of places in Balbriggan and Balrothery in north county Dublin, to name only two areas, where such speed vans are regularly located. Those locations are not speeding or accident black spots and local people know that. It seems the locations are strategically chosen to catch people driving at slightly over a very low speed limit. Local people believe the speed vans are placed there to raise revenues and meet penalty point targets. When we hear about scandals such as the breath tests, such negative views are reaffirmed in the public mind. Trust is broken and the ability to enforce existing legislation, let alone new traffic measures, becomes even more difficult. Many people have an increasing lack of trust in the Minister and the Government. There is great scepticism that the vague commitments the Minister gave to Fine Gael regarding the enhancement of rural transport will be acted upon. Improving rural transport is vital in order to sustain all elements of rural life, including the ability for rural people to socialise in their local town and perhaps enjoy a couple of drinks in their local pub. There are real problems of social isolation in rural communities. These are real problems, not imagined or exaggerated ones. Large parts of my constituency of Dublin North are rural and in them I see the effects of rural isolation. Many who live in rural isolation have few social outlets and no transport available to them other than their cars. As a nation, we do not do enough to connect people with their communities. There are pockets of Roscommon and Leitrim where communities have organised themselves to provide transport options for those living in isolation. Rural transport initiatives to bring people to a pub or community centre for an occasional night out or older people to do their shopping could meaningfully strengthen our communities. The Minister should reflect on the role his Department might play in achieving that goal. The State could do much more, we should do more and it is vital that the Minister does much more. We want the Minister to articulate more details of those plans before the Bill passes Final Stage and provide greater clarity. I have spoken to the families of people who have lost their lives as a result of drink-driving and many of them are in the Gallery this evening. Their pain is evident and their desire to reduce the number of such deaths on our roads is entirely understandable. That desire is genuinely felt by all Members. My party and I have been convinced by speaking to the families and hearing from the Road Safety Authority that this legislation may help to save some lives.It will change the existing link between being over the limit and receiving penalty points to a link between being over the limit and disqualification from driving. This has the potential to further alter people's behaviour, which, it is to be hoped, will save lives. As I said previously, the legislation is not a silver bullet. Those reckless individuals who drink to excess and get behind the wheel of a car, leading to tragic consequences and carnage, will probably not be dissuaded from their criminal actions by the Bill. They are not dissuaded by the existing sanctions of disqualification attached to blood alcohol levels greater than 80 mg. However, any measure which might prevent even one death on our roads is a measure we support and, accordingly, we will vote in favour of the legislation. However, we do not accept that this legislation alone will fix the problem the Minister is determined to fix. I appeal to him to resist the urge to continue belittling anyone who questions his approach and instead to try to work in a more meaningful, cross-party manner to try to tackle some of the most challenging social issues we face.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	315	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak briefly on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 and to support it strongly. However, on reading the Bill, it is a little like a jigsaw, amending different sections and subsections of the many Road Traffic Acts, with deletions and substitutions also provided for. The Bill therefore reinforces the urgent need for a consolidation project for all Road Traffic Acts back to 1961. The number of Acts and the complexity of legislating in this area have led to so many loopholes and lacunae over the years, which weaken what should, in practice, be very strong road safety legislation. It is unfortunately typical of this piecemeal Government that whereas Deputy Paschal Donohoe committed to consolidation of road traffic law when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport a few years ago, the current Minister told me at the beginning of October:The consolidation of existing road traffic legislation is a significant project, requiring the allocation of resources specifically to deal with such a project over an estimated two to three year period. In light of the fact that my officials are currently working on a number of Bills, most of which are primarily focused on road safety, it is not possible to commence such a consolidation project at this time.However, just last week I asked the same question of the Taoiseach, who was the predecessor of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in the very same Department, and he said:[Consolidation] is, it is fair to say, a longstanding project in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. I am not sure how much progress has been made on the legislation as yet ... A consolidated Bill would be a very good step forward.The Taoiseach went on to refer to the fact we have consolidated company law and taxation law over the years to very good effect. The question for the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is, where exactly does he stand on consolidation? Is he committed to it, or has it again been put on the long finger? During debate on the Road Traffic Bill 2016 last December, the Minister, Deputy Ross, told me:My Department is working on consolidation, as has always been the case. I understand it is being worked on quite aggressively at the moment.I would like the Minister, Deputy Ross, perhaps in his reply, to indicate whether or not there is a consolidation project. Since 1961 there have been something like 16 or 18 Road Traffic Bills and a whole plethora of other Bills which also affect the courts system and transport generally. However, after that initial caveat, I commend the Minister for bringing forward this important legislation and for his determination in the past 18 months on different matters to improve road safety for road users. I am delighted to support the Bill. The Minister has certainly faced much opposition to the Bill from lobby groups such as the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, the Fianna Fáil Party and some rural Deputies, and I note the weasel words from Fianna Fáil again tonight. Rural Deputies wrongly state that the Bill is anti-rural. In fact, as the Minister already said, 81% of alcohol-related road deaths occur in rural Ireland and, therefore, the Bill will undoubtedly save rural lives. The legal blood alcohol content, BAC, limit is 50 mg for most drivers and 20 mg for certain drivers, namely, learners, novices and professional drivers. However, due to an anomaly inserted into legislation by Fianna Fáil, drivers over the 50 mg limit but under 80 mg receive just three penalty points and a €200 fine, whereas drivers with blood alcohol levels between 80 mg and 100 mg are disqualified from driving for six months and fined €400. The Bill addresses this anomaly. The disqualification penalty has been shown in the past to be a very powerful deterrent. This is the reason the Bill is fundamentally worth supporting. The Bill amends the relevant subsections of section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, removing reference to penalty points and substituting references to disqualification. As I mentioned, the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in April and May showed the strength of the alcohol lobby, with many Deputies disregarding the huge numbers of lives lost and the families tragically affected by drink-driving. As the Minister knows, I have worked very closely over the years with Ms Susan Gray and her colleagues in the excellent civil society group Promoting Awareness, Responsibility and Care on our Roads, PARC. I warmly welcome some of our guests to the Gallery, including Susan and other members of PARC and the Clancy family and others whose lives have been tragically affected by loss of lives on our roads. I pay tribute to the heroic work of Susan Gray, Ann Fogarty, Noel, Fiona and Declan Clancy, James Regan Snr. and James Regan Jnr., Louise Doyle, Marie McElhinney, Jo Petford and the many other campaigners for saving lives on Irish roads over the years. Susan lost her husband, Stephen, very tragically a number of years ago on St. Stephen's Day. The unaccompanied learner driver in that crash had been drinking that evening. The Road Safety Authority, RSA, has compiled data on alcohol's involvement in fatal crashes which show that between 2008 and 2012 alcohol was a contributing factor, as the Minister said, in 38% of fatal crashes. In her appearance before the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport on 17 May to refute disingenuous claims by the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, RSA chief executive Ms Moyagh Murdock stated, "A total of 25 drivers and motorcyclists with a confirmed BAC between 21 mg and 80 mg were responsible [...] for killing themselves [tragically] and-or others because they consumed alcohol." Based on statistics available from the RSA, the Minister has estimated that at least 35 people could possibly be saved on our roads over a period of five years. Those 35 precious lives are well worth saving, and this is one reason we should bring this legislation forward. However, we know for a fact that the figure quoted by the Minister is an under-representation of the extent of the problem because for three and a half of these five years there was no compulsory testing of surviving drivers in fatal crashes. We also do not have the figures for those with serious injuries due to road traffic collisions where alcohol is a factor because of the dearth of accurate information in this area. Since the Road Traffic Bill 2011 there is supposed to be mandatory alcohol testing at the scene of all road traffic collisions, RTCs, where someone has died or been injured. Early questioning by me on the matter in 2012 showed that more than half of the drivers involved in RTCs were not being tested despite this legislation having been passed. In January 2015 the Tánaiste replied to a follow-up question on this, saying that up to 19 November 2014 there had been 161 fatal RTCs and that just 97 drivers, or 60%, were tested at the scene, six of whom tested positive for being above the legal limit. I then asked why the other 64 drivers were not tested and at the end of May 2015 I received an answer. At that point the information available from An Garda Síochána was that of the 181 fatal collisions in 2014, 82 drivers involved could not be tested "due to fatal injury" and a table indicated reasons for a further 51 drivers. However, 51 plus 82 equals only 133, and an explanation was never given for the remaining 48 drivers. Many other reasons were given for not testing drivers at the scene, but these figures do not seem acceptable. I submitted questions on this matter again recently and again received "holding" replies. Section 3 of the Bill relates to the transitional provision for the period prior to commencement of section 1 of the Bill. Disqualification from driving for the offence of driving with a BAC of between 50 mg and 80 mg will only apply after the commencement of section 1, so I hope the Minister will this time indicate that we will have an early commencement of this section.We have experience of the Road Traffic Act 2016 where a number of sections were not commenced despite the fact this House took on board amendments from Opposition parties and Independents. The Minister has effectively ignored them and refused to commence sections. The Minister said in a reply to a parliamentary question earlier in October that he would add an amendment to address the need for section 41 of the 1994 Act to give powers to An Garda Síochána to seize the vehicles of unaccompanied learner drivers. Last week saw much discussion in the media about vehicles owners being responsible for unaccompanied learner drivers. Will the Minister indicate whether there are one or two Government amendments being brought forward relating to unaccompanied learner drivers on Committee Stage? They relate to the power of gardaí to seize cars and making vehicle owners responsible. Both provisions are to improve road safety which the Minister promised this time last year to Mr. Noel Clancy and his family. The Dáil passed a section of the Road Traffic Act 2016 to this effect. Unfortunately, the action by the Minister then turned out to be an empty promise. We want to know for definite this time when the commencement orders will be signed for the various sections. I welcome the provisions in section 2 which amend the Road Traffic Act 2002 to provide for the pausing of penalty point timing during a period of disqualification. Therefore, penalty points and reaching the threshold for penalty points will run consecutively rather than concurrently with any period of disqualification, as in other jurisdictions. As always, the library and research service produced a very useful and informative Bill digest. It discusses the Bill and includes an interesting section on what works to combat drink driving. I note the RSA talks about the three Es, education, engineering and enforcement. We know that greater enforcement of road safety legislation is key. More mandatory intoxicant tests, MITs, and visibility of gardaí on the roads are the most important aspects of increasing road safety and reducing deaths and serious injuries. There are also some technical and practical things that the relevant industries, the motor insurance industry, for example, could be involved in championing. The ignition interlock is an area that is of interest. It is a device linked to the vehicle which would prevent the vehicle from starting if any alcohol was detected in the driver’s breath. Queensland state in Australia, for example, uses these locks for drivers who have already been convicted of drink-driving and interlocks are also used in some European countries. Drink-driving is an international issue and organisations, including the World Health Organization, WHO, have published reports and strategies on how to reduce drink-driving. Disqualification for driving over the limit is one of the WHO’s recommendations, as is lowering the blood alcohol content, BAC, limits. It is in line with the legislation before us. The 2010 North review in the UK stated that "the threat of a substantial period of mandatory disqualification has proved to be a potent weapon in combatting drink driving.” I believe that vehicle manufacturers and EU vehicle standards, in other words, the whole car industry, need to focus on driver safety most of all. For example, why do many saloons not have a rear window wiper and why is speed limit warning technology which one finds in many new vehicles, such as the Toyota Avensis, not mandatory for all vehicles? In Ireland, 615 drivers were arrested in January for driving while intoxicated, 672 in February, 711 in March, 903 in April, 801 in May, 750 in June, 723 in July and 776 in August. This represents an increase of 14% on the same period last year. It would be interesting to see how many of these, depending on the BAC levels, have taken their penalty points and paid their fixed charge notices to avoid a court appearance and how many have decided to challenge the matter in court. We know that because of a mistake by the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, while he was the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, large numbers of drink-driving cases have been thrown out of court due to the loophole around the breathalyser reports being printed in only Irish or English. That was SI 541. The Minister at the time and the Department seemed to misinterpret the rule about two copies being given after a breath test, one for the driver and one for the Garda Síochána. We await the opinion of the Supreme Court on this. The previous Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, closed the loophole arising from Deputy Varadkar's mistake in 2015. In January this year, the RSA conducted a national survey on attitudes to drink-driving and, as the Minister of State said, found that 91% of people surveyed supported automatic disqualification for those driving over the limit. As the Minister of State said, this equates to 93% in favour from rural Ireland and 89% from urban areas. I do not buy the argument that the Bill is anti-rural. The figures I have mentioned here today show that, statistically, more rural lives will be saved given that alcohol is a factor in such a high percentage of road traffic crashes, RTCs, around the country. Saying that rural pubs will suffer is a totally unacceptable argument against this Bill. Using social isolation as a reason for rejecting the Bill disrespects the thousands of friends and families who have lost loved ones or suffered serious injuries in road traffic crashes due to alcohol over the years on Irish roads. As a transport spokesperson in the past for the Labour Party, I was always a strong supporter of local and community public transport companies. I remember an impressive local transport company, OK Transport, a brilliant public service for Offaly and west Kildare, and other similar bodies from Kerry, Cork and various parts of Ireland, presenting to the committee which covered transport. Local taxi and hackney services should also be encouraged and measures should be brought forward to support them. I note the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, responded sympathetically to Deputy Heydon's proposal that we should support local rural transport providers. Like my Sinn Féin colleague, I would like to see evidence of that as soon as possible. Besides the number of tragic deaths and the horrendous suffering of families following deaths of family members, there is a simple and powerful argument against drink-driving. A motor vehicle is a complex machine where the driver's absolute and full attention is always necessary when the vehicle is in use. No employer would permit an employee to operate machinery if he or she was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Why should the operation of a vehicle be any different? Already this year, as of yesterday lunchtime, we have lost 130 people on our roads and while this is 33 fewer than last year, it is still far too many. We are not giving enough attention to serious injuries caused on our roads. I was invited recently to a very informative briefing by Dr. Jack Short from Trinity College Dublin on a paper he published in October 2017, Traffic injuries in Ireland: a neglected problem, for the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society and he has found a very serious problem with the reporting and recording of serious injuries caused by road traffic crashes. His initial conclusions seem to be that serious crash injuries may be underestimated by a factor of three. He gives interesting statistical evidence from what he has been able to gather from the health system and justice system that this is indeed the case. I believe the Department is currently examining Dr. Short's paper and I would certainly encourage it to do so. We know that conviction rates for drink-driving remain low and even if the court figures are believed, the number of those who have lost their licence on conviction is shockingly low and worse still are the recorded figures of those who have been disqualified from driving returning their licences to the RSA post office box address in Cork. On 29 May 2017, I visited the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, on the invitation of Professor Denis Cusack, its director. It was a very informative and useful visit. It would be very useful for all Deputies to visit it. Professor Cusack, his colleagues and the chief analyst showed us breath-testing and drug-testing devices. We were informed that the tender for the new breath-test Draeger devices had gone out two weeks previously and was due back before the end of June. Professor Cusack said that these would then be selected and tested for months before being sent out for use. Professor Cusack also stated that he would expect the new devices to be available to gardaí in early 2018. The new breath-test devices will have a chip to record the location, time and number of each test. That visit and the information we received is positive and will hopefully return the breath-test mechanism, process and legal measures that flow from it to being a process that will become accountable, given revelations that breath-test figures may have been inflated by more than 2 million.The road safety group, Promoting Awareness Responsibility and Care, PARC, has done extensive research and analysis of figures supplied by the Minister for Justice and Equality following parliamentary questions I raised on drink driving. As the Minister of State is aware, PARC has attended court cases around the State to monitor the outcomes of road traffic offences and in particular those relating to drink driving and disqualified drivers. PARC also regularly completes analyses of parliamentary questions data from the Department of Justice and Equality. From PARC’s analysis of drink-driving court cases during 2015 and 2016, an average of 20% of those convicted in court had their licence numbers recorded. This figure reduced to 7% in Kerry and 8% in Limerick. The Road Safety Authority, RSA, is in charge of driver licences since 2013 yet, on its own admission to RTÉ this year, 98% of persons who are disqualified are not surrendering their licences to the RSA. It appears there are huge gaps in the information and the administration of road traffic law that we need to address urgently. I warmly welcome the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 and urge all my Dáil colleagues to support it. Hopefully, it will be a major step to end drink driving and to save many lives annually.

I commiserate with anyone who has lost a loved one in any road tragedy. I have seen quite a lot of it down through the years through my work. I see the devastating effects it has on the family and the community. I must be honest and say that I have a conflict of interest when talking about this Bill because I have two brothers who work in the pub business in rural Ireland. My brother John has Chaplin's Bar in Bandon and my brother Danny has the Boston Bar in Bantry. My daughter works in two pubs, the Long Boat Bar in Durrus and Arundel's in Ahakista. There are some 25 jobs in those establishments. It is important to think of that. These are rural jobs, part-time and full-time. Every publican I know acts very responsibly and tries to care for his or her customers. If publicans do not care for the customer there is a long-term implication. Where is the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, going with this Bill? It is a very anti-rural Bill as far as I can see. I remember a number of years ago when the Minister for Finance at the time came to the House with his budget and said he was giving an increase in children's allowance for the first two children but not the third child. There was an outcry. People asked what the Minister had against the third child. I want to ask the Minister, Deputy Ross, what has he against the people of rural Ireland. He certainly has a set on the people of rural Ireland with this Bill, and with a number of other issues I could mention. This matter, however, is the one we are speaking on today. The Minister, Deputy Ross, is responsible for roads. There are many other factors resulting in people being killed on our roadsides. I do not agree with excessive drinking. I do not really drink much myself and if publicans had to depend on me, they would be pitied. There is, however, no talk about the Minister bringing in a Bill to shut the bar in Leinster House. In my view, it should be shut because we should not have a place of drink in Dáil Éireann. I will not drink alcohol in here. It should not be here. The Minister, Deputy Ross, should start leading by example. He should start by not bringing this Bill that will, obviously, damage rural Ireland. A Deputy across the floor of the House said earlier that rural Deputies were jumping up and down. Shame on any Deputy who would say that we would not stand up for our people. Shame on someone telling Deputies and the nation that it is the vintners who are against this measure. Of course, the vintners have livelihoods to protect; their own and those of their staff. They have young people who are depending on the job and the community depends on their service. There are many other issues the Minister is forgetting, which are the cause of loss of life in the State. I can name one of them. Why has the Minister not issued a report, or instructed the local authority to carry out a survey, on every roadside tree in the State that has caused a roadside death and which will continue to kill people? Two years ago, when I was a local authority member, I pushed as hard as I could to make sure that our local authority would do a report on trees that were falling over the roadside. We are lucky to have a great company in the ESB because the cables and the poles are holding up most of the roadside trees in west Cork. The Minister, however, will not worry about this issue. Do not worry about the loss of life if a tree falls on a person. These are the matters he should be looking at instead of picking on this issue, but this issue is popular. It is a highly emotional topic for many people. I am aware of the lack of funding for roads in my constituency. The Minister is in charge of roads. That lack of funding is a cause of deaths on our roads. There is no funding whatsoever for roads such as the N71, the R581 or the R582. I get details of little bits of funding, such as €20,000 or €30,000. This is nothing as such. The Minister of State should try to travel the road from my parish of Goleen to Cork city some time. I can tell him it would be the rockiest spin he would ever have. There is no funding for our roads and the roads are in severe danger of causing loss of life. The Government talks of rural-proofing Government policy, but that is the biggest cod that was ever mentioned in this Dáil. It is a mockery to the people of rural Ireland. I raised the issue last week in regard to the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill. I asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, about rural-proofing. He said that he was speaking to people about it. However, people are being told what the Government is going to do. That is not rural-proofing. This is the same. If the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport wants to go ahead with a measure such as this what has he put in place to help the people of rural Ireland come and go within their community? He has put in place nothing. He will talk to them again. The Minister speaks of social isolation but I am afraid he does not have a clue what it means. Before this Bill ever reached the Dáil the Minister should have resolved that issue but he did not. He is failing in his duty to the people of Ireland. Our Constitution does not say it looks after the people of urban Ireland, its states that it looks after the people of Ireland. With this Bill the Minister is failing in his duty to do that. There are many issues causing upset, annoyance and frustration in this regard. The Minister was in west Cork during the summer and he will not deny the number of people he met to discuss roads and tourism issues. I accept he has a big brief. Every group he met, however, told him not to go ahead with this Bill. They were not all publicans and brewery people, they were people from rural Ireland who understood what rural Ireland means. The Minister listened to them but still he went ahead with this. Another issue that applies in this respect is driver licences. There is frustration among young people on this matter. There is a complete lack of public transport where I live. The bus leaves at 7 a.m. and comes back at 8 p.m. Is that the way to treat people? Is this the way to bring forward Bills that cause further isolation, further mental health issues and further difficulties? The way the Minister, Deputy Ross, has gone about it is certainly wrong. One needs to look at the rural-proofing and resolve the issues before bringing forward another measure that might have catastrophic consequences for quite a lot of people. There are many people pleading for driver tests but there is a backlog for months. This leads to more frustration. There are many people who are returning to Ireland from all over the world. I met a gentleman over the weekend who has brought considerable employment to Ireland and yet he cannot get an Irish driver licence. Last week he could drive in Manhattan but he cannot drive in west Cork this week because he does not have an Irish driver licence. This is another way of making life more difficult for a person in a rural community.

The Multi-Party Actions Bill 2017 will revolutionise the way our courts handle cases and could give countless numbers of people greater access to justice than heretofore. The Bill represents a significant step towards a fairer, more equitable justice system. At the launch of the Law Reform Commission paper on multi-party actions in 2005, Ms Justice Susan Denham, as she then was, said that the law was too expensive, too slow and too unequal. Unfortunately, that remains the case yet the proposals developed in that paper have sat on a shelf ever since. The legislation is a potential game changer in terms of how the courts deal with large numbers of people affected by a particular injustice or inequity whose cases share a common issue of fact or law. The Bill has a very wide potential application. For example, it would have been of utility in the instance of the DePuy hip replacement cases. It could apply to a wide range of cases involving institutional abuse, especially the current tracker mortgage scandal, making it much easier and more realistic for the victims of this rip-off to sue the banks. I will return to the application of the proposal to this issue. Multi-party litigation relates to groups of cases that share characteristics sufficient to allow them to be dealt with collectively. This is about access to justice, but it is also about efficiency and case management. At the moment, there is no comprehensive procedure in the Irish legal system which can deal with such claims. The representative case model is deficient for this purpose and of no use to many of the people our Bill would benefit because it only provides injunctive or declaratory relief. That one cannot seek damages is a major deficiency. Currently, the only real option is for a test case to proceed and related cases to follow subsequently on the basis of that precedent. This model has significant drawbacks too. First and most significantly, the person taking a test case faces the very significant consideration that an order for costs will be made for which he or she alone will be liable. This is an enormous disincentive to taking any case, particularly for people who may be on limited incomes or dealing with debt already, such as someone in mortgage arrears. It also means that the person taking the case has no direct responsibility to others in the same or similar situations who do not have to be notified. It is essentially a single case on a single set of facts, even if the Judiciary has skilfully used the model to deal with classes of cases. That is constructive administration and, ultimately, not a sustainable model for dealing with these kinds of case. It is not possible to calculate the potential overall liability of all cases in the class or category of cases under this model. This is obviously difficult for the defendant, but also for potential plaintiffs for whom there might be nothing left after the first or initial cases. There is obviously also the issue of legal representation and duplication of costs. To quote the Law Reform Commission paper on this matter: "The test case approach encourages, even if it does not validate, the multiplication rather than the division of costs for the generic issue among the members of the group." I note that our proposals are based largely on the 2005 paper. I pay tribute to those who worked on that recommendation, in particular the lead researcher, Mr. Ronan Flanagan. The paper continues:This is principally because the test case is not a recognised, and therefore controlled, procedure. Each case within the group is regarded as an independent unit requiring individual and separate attention. In this way, the test case fails to acknowledge the overlap among the group on the generic issue and thus allows for a separate billing of costs for individual cases.In essence, there is duplication of legal representation and of the costs of litigation. The existing processes are totally inadequate for many people, and categories of people, who are seeking justice for the wrong inflicted upon them. While they offer some benefits, there is no reason they could not coexist with the model we propose. That model is much more dynamic and its major benefits are that it would reduce the cost of litigation, reduce duplication and cost of representation, make better use of court resources and, crucially, improve access to justice. The process would work as follows. A group of persons affected by some injury or injustice who wish to take a case would first contact the Courts Service to see if there was any previously certified relevant multi-party action. If not, a nominated judge could certify that there is a common or related issue of law or fact and that a multi-party action offers a fair, appropriate and efficient procedure for resolution. This is governed under section 2. We have also sought to implement the Law Reform Commission recommendation on commonality as a requirement, rather than the condition of "sameness", which is far too restrictive. A requirement for sameness can restrict the ability of plaintiffs to join a case currently. Under the proposed procedure, a judge would issue a multi-party action order, as set out in section 3, including criteria by which permission to be entered on the register shall be considered. The order would also contain directions on the publication of the multi-party action, which is an important mechanism to ensure that other people who have been affected by the issues would be notified of the case and their ability to join it. That is dealt with in section 4. This is crucial given that there is every possibility that, as with the tracker mortgage issue, the affected parties will be spread across the country. They would be unaware, save for newspaper reports, that a case was being taken. As such, this procedure allows them to be notified. We have again gone along with the Law Reform Commission's recommendation of an opt-in mechanism, rather than an opt-out mechanism, for reasons of efficiency and certainty. This is subject to a power of the court to oblige that an action to be joined to an existing multi-party action. The judge's directions will also contain a closing date after which people cannot join the multi-party action. Section 5 relates to the directions the judge may give as to the resolution of the order. The documentation must include the cause of action and the order may contain any further directions required for the appropriate fair and efficient resolution of the multi-party action issues. This provision is crucial in terms of the flexibility the judge will require in case management. I reiterate that efficient case management and administration goes to the heart of this process. Section 6 relates to the lead solicitor who will lead the action and his or her appointment. This efficiency in legal representation is a central benefit of the model. Section 7 relates to the lead case or cases to be agreed by case conference to represent the central and common issues in the set of cases. Section 8 relates to the effect of a multi-party action order and the circumstances in which it is binding. Section 9 provides for costs, which shall be divided equally unless the nominated judge orders otherwise. Liability for costs shall be joint and several. Section 10 provides that nothing in the legislation shall be construed as limiting or reducing the power of an authority to make rules regarding a court, provided they are consistent with the provisions of the Bill. Section 11 provides for the Short Title and commencement. The Bill offers radical reforms which could make a considerable difference to people's ability to take cases as a class. We are far behind comparable jurisdictions in not having an avenue to justice like this.It could have a similar effect and impact as processes such as the class action in the United States, or the group legal order in the UK. There are many people out there who are the victims of such injustices and who would have an actionable case but the cost of taking it on themselves makes it effectively impossible. This brings access to justice within their grasp. It is not difficult to think of the many categories of people who could have and can benefit from the ability to take cases. For example, victims of institutional abuse could have taken cases against the institutions which allowed that to happen - together rather than as individual cases. Victims of related medical negligence, or malpractices, could have taken actions against the hospital or doctor responsible. People who suffered due to faulty products, medical or otherwise, could band together in an action under this process. The most current example is the tracker mortgage scandal. The manner in which the banks have treated the victims of the tracker mortgage scandal has been duplicitous, deceptive and scandalous, and the Government has essentially facilitated them, coalescing in their timelines. The banks have essentially taken advantage of the fact that those affected are often not in a position to take an action themselves, because of the financial cost in doing so alone. Very often, large institutions are in a position of strength in legal proceedings because of the issue of costs. This Bill redresses that balance. I believe that this Bill will allow for people to proceed on the basis of strength in numbers and will embolden many to become part of an action where previously the fear of costs would have intimidated them. We want to give those affected by the tracker mortgage scandal and other injustices the tools to take on the banks or any other such institution, body or individual, to bring them to justice and to get what people are entitled to. We hope that all parties will support this legislation and allow it to pass through these Houses without delay. It makes sense in terms of court administration, the cost of litigation and representation, and access to justice.

Cé gur mhaith liom bheith ag amharc ar an gcluiche, tá an reachtaíocht seo iontach tábhachtach agus tá ard-mholadh tuillte ag an Teachta Ó Laoghaire agus a oifig as ucht é a thabhairt chun tosaigh anocht. I commend Deputy Ó Laoghaire and his office on bringing forward this excellent Bill. I extend my thanks to Padraic Kissane, somebody we have heard a lot about in recent days and weeks, as have those who have been following the tracker mortgage issue for many years. He sent an email and drew my attention to class action and the question of why we did not have it here. That was the spark that inspired us to look into this issue and to bring the legislation forward. Having done so, we found out that, lo and behold, the legislation had already been drafted. It was done 12 years ago by the Law Reform Commission in an excellent report on the need for class action. I have listened to the stories of the many victims and some of them are personal friends of mine, while some are extended family. They have considered taking the banks to court but they have had to deal with the issue of costs, of what happens if the case goes against them and how they can take on a multibillion euro company if it appeals the case all the way to the Supreme Court. They have to ask how much of their lives it will take up and what will happen if it does not work out. We have all, including the Taoiseach, criticised the banks and spoken of them stealing money from their own customers. The original estimate was some €500 million but it is now approaching €1 billion with the number of victims being added to week in and week out. Last Thursday, Bank of Ireland told us that it robbed 6,000 other customers, including 1,800 of its own staff. There are over 20,000 victims so far and the number is expected to reach 30,000 by the time the investigations are over. Each of those individuals or families must contact a solicitor to start their case and if things progress they need to pay for a barrister to take their case to court. The mere mention of the word “barrister” will see many people simply give up at that point. That is the reality. Access to the courts is simply beyond the means of many of our citizens. How many times have we been contacted by constituents exasperated and exhausted because their only resort is the courts but they simply cannot afford or ever imagine affording the fees of the courts? I am very proud that legislation I drafted and brought through both Houses of the Oireachtas was signed into law earlier this year. It allows for many tracker mortgage victims to go to the ombudsman to seek redress but many more want their day in court. What if, for once, in this country the law allowed all the little people to gang together and take on the banks or whatever other institutions had wronged them? What if, for once, the law was on the side of the victims? That is what this Bill proposes to do. It is tempting to say the tracker scandal is rock bottom for Irish banks but I have been around too long to be so naive. There will be another scandal, banking or otherwise, where the ordinary citizen will be abused, stole from, hurt, or otherwise harmed. It will probably take years for the truth to come out and when it does the individual victims will be left on their own having to face the High Court on their own unless we make the changes here in this Bill. The system we have is intimidating. It is designed to put off the ordinary family from accessing the legal system. It is expensive and elitist. This Bill would level the playing field and give the tracker victims or the victims of the next scandal, and the one after, the chance to stand together against the faceless banks or whatever other body with bottomless reserves of cash they have to face. Deputy Ó Laoghaire has outlined the content of the Bill. He has shown how the current test case system disadvantages the claimant. The main drawback is the costs associated with an individual taking a case. As the Law Reform Commission states, the test case system multiplies costs while the representative case model only provides injunctive and declaratory relief. We are proposing a better, more democratic model which would reduce the cost of litigation, reduce duplication and cost of representation and make better use of court resources, thereby improving access to justice. Put simply, if a group of people with a common grievance against a particular body or company decides to do so, they can approach the Courts Service and, if they qualify, could be considered a multi-party action. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire has outlined, ideally a change to the civil legal aid rules is in order too so that litigants with limited financial means will be able to access this new system. They are then a part of a group taking a case for justice together as a class of people. Mar a deir an seanfhocal, ní neart go cur le chéile. This Bill is not some sort of kneejerk reaction to the tracker issue. The Law Reform Commission mapped out all these issues and this solution in 2005, in a comprehensive and well-researched report. However, Government after Government let it gather dust. When I recently asked the Minister for Justice and Equality if he planned to finally act on this report he told me, "I will continue to bear it in mind for discussion and possible action in the general context of any upcoming reforms in the civil justice area." There is clearly absolutely no Government intention to bring forward this legislation so I am proud that Sinn Féin has done so. I hope all sides can get together and carry this Bill forward, not just to Committee Stage but to passing it into law as soon as possible. We have condemned the banks and expressed sympathy with the victims of trackers and now is the time for action. We owe it to the victims of the tracker mortgage scandal, and so many other scandals this State has seen and sometimes played a role in, to not only continue to stand up for them but to also show that we are learning lessons and changing. My party is ready to work with all sides to progress this Bill. We accept there may be legitimate concerns and there may also be some scaremongering and circling of the wagons inside and outside this Chamber. However, I have met legal representatives with more than 100 cases before the courts and it is crucially important because the victims of the tracker scandal want their day in court. I have met advocates who have victims who want to have their day in court.The question we need to ask ourselves is whether we will make them have to take each case individually, and bear that cost, risk and pressure, or do we listen to what the Law Reform Commission said in 2005, when it wrote legislation, on which this Bill is based, to allow for multiple action, or class action, suits to be introduced in the State. The time for words is over and it is now time of action, and I ask the Dáil to pass Second Stage today. I ask Members to encourage, through their parties and groups, that it is expedited through Committee Stage so we can tell the 30,000 tracker mortgage holders that if they wish to go to court they can join another victim, or hundreds or thousands of other victims, and take on the banks, and that we in the Parliament are levelling the playing field for them.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	323	I will make a statement on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan. I thank Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire for introducing his proposed Multi-Party Action Bill 2017. At the same time, I assure the House that the Government will be monitoring the progress and outcome of the Central Bank's ongoing tracker mortgage examination process and will consider further policy actions if necessary. The Government is also determined to follow through on the range of follow-up actions and information deadlines to which the banks have now committed. As the House is aware, multi-party litigation refers to situations where a number of parties are involved in a single piece of litigation and in relation to which they stand on common legal ground. Well-known examples have been the Army deafness claims, social welfare equality cases and asbestos exposure claims. A key point of reference is the report on multi-party litigation that was published by the Law Reform Commission in September 2005. It is important to note at this point of our discussion that the Law Reform Commission proposed that this new procedure be dealt with by the rules of the Superior Courts rather than primarily by legislation. At the back of its report, in Appendix A, the Law Reform Commission provided a draft of those very rules to apply to multi-party actions. While it is claimed that tonight's Private Members' Bill has drawn from the 2005 Law Reform Commission report, the Bill takes a fundamentally different approach. Whereas the Law Reform Commission took the rules of court approach that I have just mentioned, the document before us just copied and pasted those rules word for word into the text of what is proposed to be a Bill. This was not the intended purpose. Not surprisingly, therefore, a number of fundamental issues arise. This follows the Bill's initial consideration at the Department of Justice and Equality as well as by the Courts Service and the Office of the Attorney General. On behalf of the Government, therefore, I will oppose this Private Members' Bill. The following are some of the key observations that have informed the Government's position. The Bill is technically flawed in that it seeks, inappropriately, to enact as primary legislation a scheme that was intended by the Law Reform Commission to be in the form of rules of the Superior Courts. There are considerable doubts as to whether multi-party action measures would be of any assistance in the resolution of issues relating to mortgage contracts or tracker rates and, in the context of the timeline for actions to be addressed by the courts, it should be noted that a more efficient redress and compensation scheme is in place. Whether multi-party actions are introduced in Ireland is a significant public policy issue, with legal and constitutional implications that would have to be carefully examined. While a Law Reform Commission report exists, it is now 12 years old and, therefore, a review of its recommendations is necessary. The President of the High Court has agreed to consider the question of multi-party actions as part of the review of civil justice administration that is under way. Multi-party litigation is being held out as a cost effective and efficient avenue for those adversely affected by the tracker mortgage issues that have arisen. However, it is questionable whether the proposed Bill would be a viable course of action in mortgage contracts, as a series of class actions would likely be necessary given the likely multiple defendants involved, both multiple banks and a number of funds to which mortgages have been sold, and the multiple different forms of mortgage contracts involved, both within each bank and-or across banks. The following observations on the proposed Bill can also be made. The Bill simply substitutes the formula "in this Bill" for the Law Reform Commission's original language of "In this Order". This is a crude changing of rules intended to be applied in the courts into provisions to be applied externally to the courts under primary legislation. This runs against the preference and recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in 2005 to deal with the multi-party action issue by means of rules of court rather than by new legislation. A most important element of the Law Reform Commission proposal is omitted, namely, the requirement that any person joining a multi-party action scheme agrees, at or before the time he or she joins it, on the terms of any settlement arrangement. The Law Reform Commission wanted its new procedure to be an alternative alongside existing options where considered more appropriate. In that light, the principal routes open to pursue privately driven multi-party litigation that remain under our law, namely, the representative action or the test case, will also have to be taken into account. Some existing rules of court apply. We would need to consider carefully the designation of a lead solicitor under a Bill in case this impinges on the right of access to the courts by an individual with a legal representative of his or her free choice. It is also considered that the proposed Bill raises legal issues regarding the mandatory obligations imposed, for example, by section 7. These may have an impact on the independent role of the Judiciary under Articles 34 to 37 of the Constitution and the right to fair procedures of potential defendants to such class actions. The fact this Bill purports to apply to existing proceedings may also pose legal issues regarding legislative intervention in ongoing proceedings, which may alter the outcome of those proceedings contrary to the separation of powers. It would be considered safer for any such Bill to apply to new proceedings only. In the 12 years that have elapsed since publication of the Law Reform Commission report on multi-party litigation there have been a number of key developments. The implementation of the report after this amount of time and the introduction of any legislation to enable the type of collective legal action envisaged, would require a detailed consideration of its merits and impacts in the public interest. This would include the sustainability of a collective action regime and its potential costs to the parties concerned and to the Exchequer. Moreover, the areas of law involved span consumer protection, competition, the environment and the provision of financial and other services, and would require cross-departmental policy consultation. It is also recognised by the Government that consideration needs to be given to the relevant intervening developments that have taken place at national, European Union and wider international levels. This includes our neighbouring jurisdictions of England and Wales, where group litigation orders have been in place for the past 15 years and from where valuable lessons regarding multi-party actions may be learned. Taking all of these matters into account, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has secured the agreement of the Government to refer the question of the introduction of a multi-party action procedure in the Irish legal system for consideration by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly as part of the review of civil justice administration he has recently commenced. In opposing the Private Members' Bill for the very substantial reasons I have set out I would, at the same time, commend the initiative of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to the House.
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	324	I welcome the Bill introduced by my Sinn Féin colleagues and I am pleased to be able to speak on it. As has been mentioned, the Bill replicates many of the findings and recommendations from the 2005 Law Reform Commission report on multi-party litigation, known as class actions in other jurisdictions.The Minister and others have mentioned the current test case procedure that comes before a court, whereby the doctrine of precedent upholds the law. That is meant to filter down into other cases, but unfortunately and as has been mentioned, many people who try to access justice and the courts are inhibited and prevented from doing so because of the lack of progress on procedures we have seen in comparative European jurisdictions and also in the US. If the approach that is being proposed in this legislation is adapted and amended accordingly, it will allow for a collective multi-party approach and thereby rebalance what we are seeing in Irish society right now. We have monsters of banks that are able to absorb individuals who have little financial capacity or ability to take on anybody, even in cases of criminal matters. That is why action beyond an investigation or an exploration by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly is required and why this House should examine this Bill further. It is important to note that as the Minister of State has mentioned, a civil law review group under the President of the High Court is looking at a range of topics, including access to class actions in Ireland. Fianna Fáil is supporting this Bill on Second Stage and would like to see it progress to Committee Stage and to pre-legislative scrutiny. It is important for the President of the High Court to expedite his investigation into this matter so that both initiatives can be intertwined in the context of improved probability of people being able to access class actions in an Irish context. As a party, we are happy to facilitate the progression of this Bill. We will support it so that it can go to the justice committee for pre-legislative scrutiny, which is an important part of oversight. If we stop the progress of this Bill at this stage, we will prevent the courts system from having an opportunity to give people the right to a class action. This issue, which has been dealt with properly in other countries, is highly topical. It is having a daily impact on many individuals for whom access to justice is impossible. The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, has highlighted Helen Hershkoff's contention that the use of the public interest litigation model has been directed towards finding a social and legal voice for the disadvantaged and other vulnerable groups. As we know, across Ireland justice on a civil basis is accessible only to those who have deep pockets. It is unfair that many people in Ireland, particularly in the financial sector at present, cannot take on those who have hundreds of lawyers. This is not how the system was calibrated from the start in this country. As Mel Cousins has mentioned, this institutional barrier is a restriction on access to justice in the courts. By blocking the Bill on Second Stage, the Minister is not providing for any proactive engagement at Government level to try to make the Bill workable in the interests of ensuring people potentially have the capacity to take class actions in the future. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, which is examining legislative proposals in this area. This Bill is particularly topical in the light of recent revelations about the banks' treatment of customers on tracker and fixed-rate mortgages. Multi-party actions could be affective in addressing institutional abuses or where faulty medical products like those mentioned earlier have affected a large number of people. At present, there is no mechanism for complainants to come together to take a united case against another party. Instead, an individual test case can be taken, even if there is no place in legislation for such a case, and the judgment in that case acts as a precedent for future legal cases. It is a question of the ability to litigate and to take on whatever the flip side is. I know we are speaking about banks and the tracker mortgage scandal in this context, but the State often uses its resources to inhibit individuals and prevent them from exercising their constitutional rights. It is important to mention that the State is a big opponent of class actions across many areas where it has failed to provide services to individuals. It is regrettable there is no set mechanism for collective cases. This legislation seeks to change this, essentially by empowering people to come together to take class actions or multi-party actions. It is about trying to level the playing field and ensure everyone has a route to justice. The justice system must serve everyone fairly and equally, but many people are currently finding it impossible to take on big banks and corporations. It is important for the Oireachtas to move proactively to provide a procedural change that will empower individuals to come together while also acting as a deterrent to the banks. In many cases that are taken in an Irish judicial context, the banks know they can defend the indefensible and the illegal. That is happening across the board. They know that individuals will not have access to justice and will not be able to make progress with their cases to the point where they see their constitutional rights vindicated. This Bill will act as a deterrent in the white-collar sector by ensuring individuals and corporations do not undermine the rights of individuals. We have heard at length the painful testimony of those caught up in the tracker mortgage scandal. We have heard about the isolation and vulnerability experienced by customers of banks who have been wronged and treated deplorably and who feel they do not have the power or the ability to take on the banks that make multimillion euro profits. AIB, which employs more than 10,000 people, announced an operating profit of €814 million earlier this year on the back of €1.5 billion in income. Crucially, it was revealed last year that AIB employs 114 solicitors, which is more than most practising law firms. This is an illustration of the plight of individuals when they take on conglomerates. They face barrier after barrier, and legal representative after legal representative. It is important that we make progress with this Bill on behalf of people who are in negative equity and facing potential bankruptcy because of the criminality of the banks. In effect, the banks are a big class action in themselves. The same can be said of the State. They have limitless finance and capacity to take on individuals and appeal particular judgments. For the individual in each case, it is the difference between having a home and not having a home; or between having his or her rights vindicated and not having them vindicated. How on earth can an ordinary citizen take on a bank that has 114 solicitors? A rebalancing must occur. The Government should allow this legislation to progress to the pre-legislative scrutiny stage so that we can amend it appropriately and incorporate Mr. Justice Peter Kelly's recommendations into it. Such procedural changes should be made by this House. Bank of Ireland, which has more than 11,000 employees, recorded a profit of more than €1 billion in its accounts for 2016. Again, there are walls of solicitors taking on vulnerable families and individuals. That is not an appropriate context for the vindication of people's rights. How on earth can families that are trying to meet all the costs already imposed on them try take on such massive organisations? Ultimately, they cannot do so. That is why we have seen the deplorable treatment of bank customers. Other examples of cases in which we could have had collective class actions were mentioned earlier. The ripple effect on the State was actually greater because issues were not settled. Butterworths Journal of International Banking and Financial Law stated clearly in a recent publication that more than 70% of EU citizens would exercise their rights with other claimants in the event of joint proceedings. It has also found that due to the pressure of mass class actions in a US context and because of the nature of US procedural law, these claims are often settled successfully, appropriately and to the benefit and vindication of the individuals in these scenarios. That is the type of rebalancing that we need to see occurring in an Irish context. This is not just about the banks. The availability of multi-party actions will empower ordinary people who are wronged to take on huge conglomerates. We need to counterbalance the incredible power these firms possess. Individual cases can be hugely costly for litigants. The collective approach being proposed in this Bill should keep costs for individuals down. By enabling plaintiffs to play a more passive role in high-profile cases that can be enormously complex and adversarial, we will limit the extent to which they face huge public attention as individuals, which can cause enormous stress in individual family lives. There are savings for the State too. Individual cases that are taken one after another can be a considerable drain on court time and resources.Multi-action cases could in certain cases remove this and a scenario where multiple cases are taken. There are examples where despite the precedent of the High Court and test cases, the State still appeals. In effect, it generates this Ponzi scheme that is only to the benefit of lawyers, who are the intermediaries, and not the individuals, who have seen their colleagues win test cases before them but who are left to vindicate their own rights with massive legal costs. This will provide a lesson for the State to take the individual seriously and rebalance the current inequity. The introduction of such a system may also act as a strong deterrent against firms committing acts of wrongdoing. This would be particularly welcome in a climate where massively rich organisations have at times appeared to operate without fear of punishment or probity. This is a reckless scenario in the current Irish constitutional context where we should be vindicating the rights of individuals. In examining this area, we are guided by the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report and the word being undertaken by the civil law reform group. However, it is also helpful to look at any other jurisdictions to see how the issue of collective redress systems is implemented. Across the EU, different countries operate different systems, common law being applied here. In the UK, for example, one party can apply for a group litigation order, GLO, or the court might order this. The application includes a summary of the request for a legal remedy as well as the number of parties affected and the common legal issue that pervades each affected party's complaint. If a GLO is issued, a group register is set up containing the necessary information, including the registration deadline among other things. The legislation, as originally drafted and reintroduced by Deputy Ó Laoghaire, goes through the different sections. There is a threshold, balancing and safety valve whereby the President of the High Court would have to approve the multi-party action. This is prudent and also provides for the authorisation of a multi-party action at quite a senior level in our judicial system. The fact that a nominated judge can give directions in certain matters for the fair and efficient resolution of a multi-party action as per section 5 is another feature. This is not the doomsday mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton. We need to move away from the reflective and consultative approach mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, so that the Government embraces this Bill, moves it beyond Second Stage and works with it and the recommendations of Mr. Justice Peter Kelly. The UK context mirrors much of what has been recommended in an Irish context. In the Netherlands, class action suits have been allowed since 2005 where a legally binding settlement can be reached between the offending party and a foundation or association with full legal capacity representing the injured parties. Similarly in France, recognised associations can take on cases for consumers who have suffered damages in some way. However, there are strict rules in that associations cannot actively advertise or seek out injured parties. The same is true in Spain where consumer associates can claim collective damages, however, there are some exceptions here that differ slightly from other countries. Ultimately, there is great variety and a great learning curve for the officials in the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, so that they do not have to reinvent the wheel and consult for months or years in an attempt to delay this piece of legislation. If we look beyond our shores, we can see that it has worked elsewhere. It is important that the Government embraces this legislative and procedural change in the Irish context. Ideally, we should look to pick and choose what parts work best elsewhere. The European Commission has done excellent work to provide the comparator in a European context. To repeat, we should be ultimately guided by the 2005 Law Reform Commission report and the ongoing work by the civil law review group. Fianna Fáil is happy to support this legislation through Second Stage so that it can receive pre-legislative scrutiny and the recommendations of Mr. Justice Peter Kelly. We hope it receives support from both sides of this House.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	325	On behalf of the Labour Party, I unequivocally indicate our wholehearted support for this legislation. Indeed it would be contrary to what I did two weeks ago if we opposed it because two weeks ago, I drafted a similar Bill, which had 12 sections in total with a detailed explanatory memorandum of four or five pages. It was sent to the office of the Ceann Comhairle last week and details were published in the media. It received a very hearty welcome from individuals and organisations who contacted me and other colleagues. Some people were effusive in their support. The Bill had been through a period of time in gestation with me as a practising barrister. I could not understand why the rules of court never facilitated actions that are multi-party in nature and that arise in other jurisdictions across the globe. As Deputy Jack Chambers noted, they have been permitted in the Netherlands for the past 12 years while they are also permitted in France and a number of other countries. The issue is that there are rules and regulations to circumscribe the situation, which is important. I included them in my Bill. I was prompted to get on with the Bill in a definitive fashion about four weeks ago when I heard the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, make what I believe were very welcome comments championing the principle of access to the courts, which is a well-established constitutional principle. It has been interpreted by Mr. Justice Walsh and others down through the years in respect of articles of the Constitution. This blended well with the Chief Justice's stated objectives. It blends with and is complementary to that. I have no doubt that members of the Judiciary will welcome the implementation of the objectives of multi-party actions, be they enshrined in legislation, which is the preference of the Labour Party or by a substantial amendment to the current rules of court. The Law Reform Commission report of 2005 mentioned amending the rules of court but we are 12 years down the road and the matter has not been progressed. It must get an impetus from the legislative arm of Government. I note that Sinn Féin was aware of the existence of our Bill and I am somewhat disappointed it did not contact me because a joint approach would provide it with greater strength. I have no doubt that the amalgamation of both Bills would be good because the Sinn Féin Bill is stronger in some areas while my Bill is stronger in others. I was hoping that this is what would happen because of the era of new politics or this new political dispensation. I am not a great believer in it but so be it. It would be a more coherent and stronger piece of legislation which would be to everybody's benefit.  Over the years, I have seen members of the Judiciary trying through judicial ingenuity to deal with groups of cases such as the asbestos cases or the hip implant cases. Mr. Justice Cross was innovative in the way he tried to deal with the hip implant cases. What we are dealing with is a group of cases that share common and indeed adequate or sufficient characteristics to allow them to be dealt with collectively. Mr. Justice Cross devised such a mechanism to deal with hip implant cases. Some people may argue for alternative dispute resolution, ADR, which has been used successfully to deal with multi-party scenarios without resorting to legislation. I discovered that ADR was used to successfully resolve the issue of the unlawful retention by a number of hospitals in the UK of organs and tissue from young children. Examples of multi-party type litigation in Ireland include social welfare equality cases and the Army deafness cases. The Law Reform Commission report indicated that these cases highlighted the need for reform in this area of procedure and emphasised why reform was necessary and the case-by-case random approach with which such litigation was being treated. I am of the view that the Sinn Féin Bill and my Bill would remedy such approaches because consistency is important. The social welfare equality cases involved the implementation of an equality directive from 1978 whereby the State could not discriminate on the grounds of gender or marital status. The Army deafness cases arising in the early 1990s involved complaints of noise-induced hearing loss by former members of the Defence Forces. It eventually became clear that there was huge liability on the part of the State on the substantive issue that it was negligent regarding the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss in respect of serving and former members of the Defence Forces. The Department of Health established the expert group to determine the appropriate standard for measuring hearing loss and tinnitus arising from hearing loss.By consent, all Army deafness claims were adjourned pending the outcome of deliberations of the expert group. Then we had the green book which gave us the measures. The Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Act then came out of that. The Supreme Court then set out a stream of damages with regard to that and the early settlement scheme. This is important legislation in the context of the tracker mortgages scandal and the impact it has had on the victims of illegal activity, which some of my colleagues spoke about. It is nothing short of illegal activity by the subject financial institutions. This will be important for thousands of people who have been so victimised and who will be able to join a collective action to secure their rights. It would be very important because this legislation will ensure that people of limited means or who are virtually impecunious can get access to the courts and join an action. No one will compel them to join the action. They can join it themselves. We have to be very careful. There is free enterprise and freedom of contract for every individual. There is a right to a fair hearing. The European Convention on Human Rights is also involved. I am fully conversant with the issues that must be addressed in the context of such legislation if it is successfully implemented. That is no excuse for more delay. We have representative actions here but they are of a very limited nature. They are only declaratory or injunctive. One cannot get damages. What one could get today in terms of the bank cases, which is an absolute scandal, is a declaratory action saying specific people are entitled to something. That is not damages. The last thing they want is to have to chase around again. The test case is also limited. There are two different categories. Sometimes one can choose the most appropriate to go forward from a pool of litigants which presupposes a degree of organisation among them. Sometimes without express co-ordination the outcome of a vanguard case can be awaited by others and that will provide guidance as to the possible outcomes of later actions. In a test case, the plaintiff acts in his or her own interest with no responsibility or duties towards the rest of the pool, either in the institution or any subsequent trial. That is important. This is critical legislation which should pass Second Stage. It should be referred to committee and undergo further legislative scrutiny. The Civil Law Reform Group and outside bodies might have an input in it. We could have a hearing on it. I am sure Sinn Féin will be eager for the Bill to go to the next step so we get an opportunity to have all the submissions from various parties. The last thing we want to do is long-finger it. It is prospective legislation. The Minister of State said it may impact actions already in being. That is not so. If it has to be prospective, so be it. The prospectivity in terms of the tracker scandal is very clear and evident. Nobody has taken an opportunity yet to take them to court and the quicker, the better. 
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	326	I will start with a question. How many solicitors does AIB have? I am not talking about the hired guns they hire from outside the bank. I am talking about in-house solicitors employed by the bank. According to the Law Society, the answer to that question is 114. If one were to take those 114 solicitors, cut them adrift from AIB and set them up as a separate company, it would be the seventh largest law firm in the State. That is the little army of solicitors employed by one bank alone. What chance does an ordinary citizen have against a machine like that? It could be argued the ordinary citizen has access to civil legal aid. In reality, for the vast majority of citizens, that is not the case. A person does not have a chance of getting civil legal aid unless he or she earns below the €18,000 per year threshold. A Bill such as the Multi-Party Actions Bill 2017, which would allow a form of class action and allow people to band together to take a joint case against the likes of a bank or powerful institution is a progressive reform. It is a step forward. It is something that Solidarity-People Before Profit will support going to the next Stage. It is not a magic wand. The legal system is very biased against the ordinary man and woman. This does not create a level playing pitch but if the Bill is passed it means the playing pitch is not as unbalanced or as tilted against the ordinary person as it was the day before. We see what powerful institutions like banks do when they feel they have a free hand. The tracker mortgage scandal is a case in point. To date, there have been more than 27,500 cases that we know of. On account of this scandal, 23 mortgageholders have lost their homes and 79 people have lost their homes as a result of buy-to-let properties being repossessed. This was not a mistake. It is not something that was magicked up by a computer or a robot. It was a conscious cold-blooded decision made by men and women in the senior management of the banks to rob and defraud ordinary citizens and householders. If the Multi-Party Action Bill in even a small way can redress that imbalance of power and allow ordinary citizens to strike out for justice on an issue such as this, it would be a positive thing. The Bill would not just relate to people ripped off by the banks in the tracker mortgage scandal. It would relate to people dealing with profit-hungry developers who have ripped them off on the pyrite scandal. It would also relate to the State which has treated people scandalously in the likes of the Magdalen laundries and so on. It is telling that we do not have class action legislation of this kind in the State. The absence of legislation such as this says a lot about the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Party which have led Governments down through the years. It is shameful that the Government is setting its face against this legislation. We will not do so. We will back it and will continue the discussion on the next Stage.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	327	Every time I hear the expression, "the tracker mortgage scandal", I cannot help thinking of the advertisement that was used to get people to buy into tracker mortgages. There are a dozen people sitting on an Imp bus going through the city of Dublin saying to each other out loud, "I don't know what a tracker mortgage is." It turns out the bankers did not seem to know what a tracker mortgage is either. However, we are in a situation where nobody can access justice against the banks for what they did to tens of thousands of people. The main purpose of the Bill is to deal with that situation so we very much welcome it. It will benefit others who find themselves at odds with an arcane legal system that insists that even when a case affects dozens or hundreds of people, individuals must take cases separately. As Deputy Barry said, it is quite alarming that we have gone through this many decades of a so-called modern state and we do not already have that facility in law. Any bias against ordinary people taking cases, for example, against wealthy corporations, would be addressed by the Bill. Ordinary people generally do not have the ability to spend the hundreds of thousands of euro that is required to pay lawyers in this archaic legal system. This type of legislation might make it more possible for them. It will not rock the Casbah; it exists in America, but so does injustice at a high level and great scale. It will give people more access to a level playing field. There are many cases that we have seen in the United States in which people have won class actions, particularly on environmental issues, such as the community living in Love Canal. We welcome this attempt to reform a court system that was very much condemned by ourselves and others in this House earlier in the year when Deputy Jim O'Callaghan introduced a Bill which would reform the Judiciary. It will open the secret worlds of the Kings Inns and the Law Society to a certain degree. I hope it will make it financially possible for ordinary citizens to access some kind of justice in a system that continues to fail them, not only against corporations and banks but also against the State.There are other scandals involving homes being built with pyrite and without basic fire safety measures, institutional abuse of women and children and the degradation of local communities by abuse of the environment. In that regard, I mention the communities in west Dublin where I live that put up with considerable interference from environmental companies which are so-called clean and friendly but which actually impose considerable degradation, trouble and hassle with implications for the community. Perhaps the Bill might open the way for such communities to take cases against them. There is also the case of Volkswagen's falsification of emissions and the resulting data breach. Throughout the world people are taking actions against corporations over coal, oil, gas, etc. because environmental destruction and interference are huge issues and related to the big question of climate change. For all of these reasons, we welcome the Bill which I do not think is a revolutionary measure. If we could get justice for communities and individuals across the globe by such measures, that would be the way forward. Unfortunately, even where there are those measures, gross injustices continue to be imposed on communities and individuals. If the Bill was to allow a little more light into the judicial system and balance the scales slightly in favour of communities and ordinary people, we absolutely welcome it and will work with others to see it through.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	328	I appreciate the opportunity to speak about the important Multi-Party Action Bill 2017 and commend Sinn Féin Deputies Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire and Pearse Doherty on introducing it. I welcome it and will be supporting it fully. Like many other Deputies, including the Acting Chairman, there have been many times throughout my political career when I have thought that access to multi-party or class actions would be of immense use to citizens and for society at large. There have always been issues that have affected citizens very profoundly and damaged their lives and I believed they should have had the remedy of class action type legislation. As a colleague just said, these are cases in which individuals face powerful companies and corporations. The current tracker mortgage scandal is a prime example where banks illegally refused to offer tracker mortgage rates to customers in line with the original mortgage agreements. The earlier scandal of endowment mortgages where consumers were badly misled by mortgage and insurance companies would also have benefited from mass-harm legislation and multi-party actions. The Acting Chairman will remember that particular major scandal. The huge suffering and costs imposed on households, families and local authorities after the discovery of pyrite in boomtime housing also called out for mass-harm legal remedies and class action against those ultimately responsible. Of course, there have been also many health, education, housing and other social deficiencies over the decades where deeply affected citizens would also have benefited greatly from multi-party legislation.  Many countries, in particular other common law jurisdictions, have had multi-party actions for many years. People often think first of the United States when class actions are mentioned. People remember, for example, class actions against the tobacco industry, the car industry and other powerful sectors of the US economy. Sometimes class actions have been criticised there on the grounds that the legal profession gains most from them and that class lawsuits often bind all participants in an action to a lower settlement than might reasonably have been secured in a solo action. However, the US Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 addressed some of these concerns. In the United Kingdom the civil procedure rules of the courts of England and Wales introduced from 1999 have provided for representative actions. There is also a sectoral mechanism under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 for breaches of competition law which is very helpful for citizens. In the Canadian provinces class actions are also permitted. Quebec began class action proceedings in 1978 and was followed by most of the other provinces. There is also multi-party action in the Federal Court of Canada. Quebec citizens were fortunate to have this legislation in place when their pyrite scandal erupted about 25 years ago. There was much more accountability there than there has been in Ireland. Under the Federal Court of Australia Act, in 1992 Australia introduced "representative proceedings" along the lines of American class actions. In New Zealand multi-party actions can be brought under High Court rules and the emergence of litigation funders has played a major role in progressing class actions. There are also class actions and multi-party legislation in many of our European neighbours, including France, Germany, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, Spain and so on. In 2005 the Law Reform Commission produced a comprehensive report on multi-party litigation and, of course, many of its recommendations are reflected in the Bill. Last year I asked the Tánaiste and then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to urgently introduce mass-harm or multi-party legislation based on the 2005 report. As she indicated, the Government was considering this legislation; therefore, the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has an opportunity to support and progress the Bill. The Law Reform Commission's report of 2005 followed on from its work in 2003 and is a comprehensive guide to the framing of rules for superior courts to permit class actions and the methods of funding of multi-party legislation. It cites case studies such as the social welfare equality cases and the Army deafness claims and sets out principles of procedural fairness and efficiency which could underpin mass-harm actions. It addresses key elements of multi-party litigation, including defining the common interest of plaintiffs, the characteristics of representative cases and the idea of a single or lead solicitor, which is very much reflected in the Bill. Rereading this very thorough research and the Bill which is based on it, it is difficult to understand why the past four Governments resolutely ignored the commission's report and chose not to institute class action legislation. Outstanding work has been carried out on mass-harm and multi-party legislation by the distinguished academic Dr. Joanne Blennerhassett who lectures in the Sutherland School of Law in UCD and has recently been working in Oxford. She has researched the subject following her chance meeting with the environmentalist Ms Erin Brockovich. She focused on this lacuna in the legal system and published her research in a book, A Comparative Examination of Multi-Party Actions
- The Case of Environmental Mass Harm. Her doctoral research and subsequent book examine the phenomenon of mass harm and how affected citizens may seek legal redress. The book looks at environmental mass harm as a case study and explores the best solutions for citizens to pursue legal remedies. Dr. Blennerhassett believes multi-party action may be absolutely necessary in certain circumstances where other avenues of redress have failed and that all those involved in mass litigation, the defendants, judges and the courts system, could benefit from a multi-party litigation procedure. She has been in touch with me a few times in recent years and I hope the outcome of her research will be reflected today. I am sure she is delighted that the legislation is before us. Regarding the specifics of the Bill, section 2 outlines the application process for the certification for a multi-party action. The authors have carefully framed the section such that applicants will need to apply to the Courts Service for a certificate and to see if there have been previous relevant actions. The application must be made to the President of the High Court who will, in turn, nominate a judge to deal with the certification, following which the matter will be a multi-party action order. Section 3 sets out the details of the order which will establish a register, specify the multi-party action issues and so on. The order will also include a direction that after a certain date a party wishing to be removed from the register will have to obtain permission from the judge. Section 4 provides for how a party will gain access to the multi-party action register. Sections 6 and 7 make provisions for the appointment of a lead solicitor and the selection of a lead case. They are particularly well framed, for which I commend the authors. Section 6(1) states there shall be consultation and agreement on the appointment, while subsection (3) makes provision for instances where a lead solicitor cannot be agreed, in which case the nominated judge will make the appointment. Subsection (4) provides for the appointment of more than one lead solicitor should the judge decide. Section 7(2) states the lead case must satisfy the judge that it "fairly and adequately represents all interests of all those on the Register". Section 9 deals with the matter of costs incurred and indicates that the members will all be liable for these costs. In general, the Bill is well founded on the outstanding research of the Law Reform Commission. I said earlier in the House that we should utilise the work of the commission in the codification of road traffic law. The work done here and also by the distinguished young Irish academic Dr. Blennerhassett on this legal procedure are well reflected in the Bill which the House, including Government Members, should support. We should allow mass-harm, multi-party actions to be a key legal device for citizens.

I would like to speak in favour of this Bill. The proposal in this Bill is broadly similar to what are known as class actions in the United States and, thus, is worth considering seriously. Clearly, there are a number of advantages associated with this form of litigation. However, there are also some disadvantages but I will deal with advantages first. As has been pointed out, multi-party actions will lead to lower litigation costs as they will be divided among the class members, thus giving people greater access to the courts. The model offers an opportunity for plaintiffs to seek relief at a lower cost. It will be much cheaper for people with limited resources to seek relief in a way that the traditional lawsuit cannot do at present. Importantly, a class action is decided in one court, leading to greater judicial efficiency. Class action litigation takes up less cumulative court time and involves fewer judges. Also, since only one decision by one court will be made, plaintiffs' recoveries should be consistent. However, in the United States there are some noted disadvantages, one being a lack of decision-making control. Representatives of the affected class make the important litigation decisions, including when to settle. The power of the individual plaintiff to have a say in whether to settle is diluted. Also, another consideration is that cases may also settle for financial compensation of some kind, whereas if the plaintiff is seeking other types of compensation, this can be problematic. It also appears that if the class action is unsuccessful in the lawsuit, then individual class members may not have the right to bring individual lawsuits at a later date. However, on balance, the advantages appear to outweigh the disadvantages. The introduction of a broadly similar system here would give citizens an important additional instrument in seeking justice. Deputy Ó Laoghaire has pointed out in his Bill that this could revolutionise the way courts deal with large-scale actions and could improve justice for countless people who have faced serious injustice, for example, people affected by the tracker mortgage scandal. It is quite likely that in the future large numbers of people will need to seek redress from large institutions, companies or corporations. I remain to be convinced that our regulatory system has sufficient robust measures to protect our citizens. In these circumstances citizens may have no choice but to go to the courts, and the multi-party action model may be the way to go. I am astounded that the Central Bank cannot even provide information to me on tracker mortgages county by county and it could not provide information to me on the number of people affected by the tracker mortgage scandal in County Clare. I was told that the Central Bank does not have the data at this granular level. In plain English, I believe this means it does not know how many people are affected by the tracker mortgage scandal region by region. At the time I put the question, the banks said 13,000 affected customers had been identified to date nationwide, the majority of whom will receive their redress and compensation before the end of the year. Since then, Bank of Ireland has said it has discovered an additional 6,000 cases where customers were due low-rate mortgages, having been told initially they were not entitled to them. Who knows what the final figure will be. All this leads to my conclusion that affordable access to the courts for large numbers of people is highly desirable. In an age when great financial institutions can wield unscrupulous control and where the regulatory authorities seem slow to catch up with them, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	331	I, too, welcome the introduction of this Bill and I compliment its authors. It is beyond time we had a measure such as this one that would make access to the courts possible for large numbers of people. Deputy Harty referred to people affected by the tracker mortgage scandal. The predatory nature of the banks, with them literally robbing and stealing from families, has gone on unimpeded. The Central Bank seems not to know or care or want to know what has happened. It is a case of just cover it up. How could any one person or a few people take a bank to court? If we have this multi-action measure, people might be able to come together and take a case. They are up against the might of banks which can hire the best legal people and frustrate the whole system. I have been down in the courts on numerous occasions with families dealing with banks. It is a different world. I found there was muffled talk at the top of the courtroom from the justice, in some cases, and that the top row of barristers and junior counsels tend to whisper. It has been said that justice delayed is justice denied but justice unheard is shambolic justice. People cannot hear it. I was in court with a litigant and the judge beamed at the woman that she would not be allowed to speak or have any assistance. She was terrorised, like a fox or rabbit caught in the headlights of a car. I moved up the courtroom step by step, row by row, to see if I could hear anything that was going on. I was up right beside the litigant, the person being charged by the banks, who had been taken from prison that morning after being put out of her home. She had been taken up by the prison officers and had been very well cared for by them, I might add, but she was literally treated like a piece of dirt. We need somebody to put some respect and manners on bankers and to ensure that we get some modicum of decency and respect in the courts for individuals and families. We are not getting that at this time. I know of cases where justices had to be forced off the Bench because they did not declare their involvement with certain banking institutions, and that has happened. The lid will be completely uncovered on this one of these days very soon, and we will have a much more murky situation than we have had in other sectors. I got very disturbing information over the weekend regarding issues related to the courts, which I will not go into here until I have the full facts, but all is not well down there. The Government's response to this multi-action legislation has been woolly, furry and muffled, and its approach has been to delay. It has been a case of preserve the status quo and preserve the status of what goes on down there. The little people do not matter. Let them go to hell but look after the banks and the vulture funds. We had that experience in a committee last week when dealing with the Finance Bill when we tried to put forward an amendment to put stamp duty on vulture funds where they are selling off loans at 20% and not offering them to the unfortunate householder, farmer or business man or woman concerned. This Bill will be passed but I hope it will not then be consigned to a shelf, delayed like many other measures have been, and not enacted for several years. The Bill is very timely and appropriate. I compliment its authors. We can look to the United States which has had class actions for a long time and the place has not fallen in, but it also has bankers behind bars. We do not have bankers anywhere other than going to the finest restaurants in the country, rubbing their hands with glee, and their attitude is to hell with the ordinary people. That is what we are dealing with. That is not what the people fought for in 1916, 1921 and 1922. That is what we have ended up with. It is a charade, a cabal. It is time we had a legislative measure like this one. I will follow it carefully as, I hope, it proceeds to Committee Stage, and I will follow its progress when it comes back to this House. I hope it will not be completely stood on and buried by the powers that be, like most other items of well-intended legislation have been.

I compliment Deputies Ó Laoghaire and Pearse Doherty on bringing it forward. The basis of this Bill is the Law Reform Commission report of 2005 which recommended the idea of multi-party actions or class actions as they are probably better known. Successive Governments have long-fingered the legislation and allowed the report to gather dust. Again tonight the Fine Gael-Independent Alliance Government has opposed this legislation. It is time that we had fair and equal access to the courts for everybody. That is what this legislation is about. It is about access to justice. Unfortunately, like our health system, we have a two-tier justice system. Money talks, and those with deep pockets, the wealthy, have easy access to the courts, whereas those who are less well off are effectively excluded from the system. The question of costs is a huge disincentive to individuals who have little or no chance when they take on banks or vulture funds. Those are supported by the failings of barristers, junior counsel and solicitors. I was in the High Court and Supreme Court with a local hospital action committee a number of years ago.We were being represented on a pro bono basis. The HSE had numerous senior and junior counsel and a whole array of solicitors. Access to the judicial system is not available on a fair and equal basis for ordinary people in this country. The Bill is very welcome. It will not level the playing pitch entirely but it certainly will help. It will help in cases like the DePuy hip situation, institutional abuse, and indeed the tracker mortgages situation currently being covered in the media. The tracker mortgages issue, in particular, cannot be solved or dealt with properly unless there is a criminal investigation by the fraud squad. I call again on the Government to send in the fraud squad to the banks to thoroughly investigate. There is no doubt in my mind that there has been huge collusion between the banks. The Bill before us will, I hope, bring about a situation in which multi-party actions or class actions are available here. They have been available in other jurisdictions for quite some time. These recommendations have been long-fingered and allowed to gather dust for over 12 years. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for procedural and other changes in civil actions so as to provide for the bringing of multi-party actions and to reduce the cost of litigation. That is a very important element, particularly for individuals who want to bring cases. The Bill also provides for other related matters. The class action or multi-party action is one in which a number of people have a similar complaint, most likely arising out of one incident or set of circumstances. It is more efficient, more effective and less costly if they come together as a group and are dealt with collectively, as opposed to each case being progressed individually. The 2005 report of the Law Reform Commission recommended that there should be a formal procedure and structure to deal with instances of multi-party litigation, which should be referred to as multi-party action. In its report, the commission made a number of recommendations as to how this system would operate, and also included a draft amendment to the rules of the superior courts to provide for it. This amendment and recommendation are mirrored in the Bill that has been brought forward by Deputies Ó Laoghaire and Pearse Doherty. I welcome the legislation and the opportunity to support it tonight. I appeal to the Government and to the Independent Alliance to allow it to go through to Committee Stage as it is a worthwhile and long overdue piece of legislation.

I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue. I commend my two colleagues, Deputies Pearse Doherty and Ó Laoghaire, for bringing forward this very worthwhile Bill. It brings into effect the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report of 2005, when the issue was examined in detail. It provides for cases to be taken on behalf of large categories of people who are affected by a particular injustice and share a common issue of fact or law. This model would significantly reduce the costs of litigation, representation and duplication. It would make better use of court resources and, most importantly, improve access to justice. The most recent example, as mentioned by my colleagues, is the tracker mortgage scandal. The banks that knowingly caused serious financial hardship for thousands of families took a gamble. They gambled that the individuals involved would not be in a position to access justice due to the high cost of litigation and, for the most part, they were right. Unfortunately, there are many other such examples. In my previous role as education spokesperson, I dealt with survivors of sex abuse in schools, many of whom had been persuaded to drop their cases against the State after the ruling against Louise O'Keeffe in the Supreme Court. To date, only seven of these victims have been offered any type of compensation by the State. Few of them will ever see any type of justice from the courts. One cannot help but wonder how different things would have been for them if this type of action had been available. Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party have previously commented on the need for such a model in Ireland. I call on every Deputy in the House to support this legislation.

I am a trade unionist, as I have said in this Chamber before. For me, there is strength in numbers and unity is, indeed, strength. It is incumbent on all of us to come together and express our support not just for the Bill but also for those outside of this Chamber who would seek to act collectively. I do not think there is any justification for denying people what should be their basic right. Nor am I overstating it when I say that the legislation, if passed, has the potential to revolutionise the way in which the courts deal with large-scale actions. It could improve access to justice for countless people who have faced very serious injustices, such as those affected by the sodium valproate scandal, the transvaginal mesh scandal, the tracker mortgage scandal and the people in my own constituency who bought homes that were affected by pyrite. In particular, the Bill will be of huge benefit in the area of health, for those who have been the victims of defective medical products, and patients who have suffered side effects of medicine which were the fault of pharmaceutical companies or in some instances health care providers. Currently, the only real option for those people is for a test case to proceed and then for related cases to follow, but it is all on an individual basis. They are always on their own. The model proposed by my colleagues has significant advantages over that. The primary benefit is that it will reduce the cost of litigation. It will also reduce duplication and the cost of representation. It will make better use of court resources and, crucially, will improve access to justice. The issue of defective mesh implant devices is one I have been looking into for the last number of months. Sooner or later the HSE and the Minister are going to have to face up to and deal with this issue. There are ongoing class actions in Australia and Britain, where women are alleging that the faulty pelvic implants are causing them debilitating pain. Ireland is no different; there are such women here. Unfortunately for them, they are forced to act only as individuals and cannot come together as a group. It is when issues like this come to light, and we see failures on an industrial scale, that we can see how important it is for people to be able to act collectively, and that is what this Bill will facilitate.

I also thank the other parties that have agreed to support it, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party, Solidarity-People Before Profit, Independents 4 Change and the Rural Independent Group. I wish to express my disappointment in the Government for failing to support this Bill. The Independent Alliance will also be siding with the Government in opposing it. The importance of the Bill has come to prominence lately due to the scandalous behaviour of the banks in robbing hundreds of millions of euro from tracker mortgage customers. Banks have once again proven that they think they are a law unto themselves. At present, investigation and prosecution of white-collar crime in Ireland is practically non-existent.Figures I received last week show the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has brought no prosecutions or achieved no convictions for white-collar crime in the past two years. It seems the State is unwilling to hold the banks to account again. If multi-party lawsuits were available to ordinary citizens, it might prove to be an effective deterrent for future wrongdoings. By allowing people wronged in a similar fashion by the same defendant to pool their resources to take collective action as one makes sense and is a worthwhile initiative. It would result in lower legal costs as similar cases could be consolidated into one. It would ensure cases which are similar do not have to clog up the courts system with individual hearings. In addition, it would allow plaintiffs who individually might be scared of or apprehensive about taking action against a defendant due to the stress or cost involved, to work with others who have been wronged in the same way, as well as allowing them to access justice they might otherwise not be able to get. As the legal maxim states, justice delayed is justice denied. Our courts system can be guilty of this at times. It is well documented that our legal system is under significant strain with a large number of cases in the courts system. Last month, Mr. Justice Sean Ryan said the Court of Appeal was coming to the point of being overwhelmed due to the number of cases waiting to be heard. Anything which can help reduce the strain on the courts system is most welcome. The Bill, which would allow for the consolidation of cases, would address this problem by resulting in fewer individual hearings, as well as being a cost-neutral solution. I commend Deputies Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire and Pearse Doherty on introducing the Bill and stress the importance of the cross-party support it has received. I am disappointed the Government will oppose the Bill.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-14 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	336	The essence of the Bill is about the difference between the weakness and strength. I commend Deputies Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire and Pearse Doherty on bringing it forward. An elderly lady, who lives not that far from me, was the victim of symphysiotomy in Manorhamilton hospital many years ago. For the most part of a decade, her two daughters went around the country to solicitors and action groups to ensure their mother would get some compensation. All the time they were told they were up against the State and the HSE, which are strong, meaning it was chancy and doubtful. Over time, as they were in contact with many others in similar positions, they found many affected elderly people went to their graves but never got any compensation or respect for what had happened. That is at the core of this legislation. Members referred to the Johnson & Johnson hip replacement case where metals from the replacements leached into recipients' bodies and poisoned them. I know people who still have the replacements but because of other illnesses cannot get them removed. Last year, a court verdict on the same issue was handed down in Dallas, Texas, which ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $1 billion in a multi-party action. These cases can be sorted swiftly if they are done together. The Bill is about dealing with issues swiftly and properly, as well as finding the mechanisms to do that. Several years ago I heard the economist, Moore McDowell, brother of Senator Michael McDowell, on the radio talking about the greatest revolution of the 20th century. He claimed it was not electricity or any such technological advancements, but the formation of the limited company because it removed the constraints of the family business. What he really meant was that it removed the morality behind the family business. It meant a limited company could act as a body which could stand back from humanity. That is what we see happening with large pharmaceutical companies, banks and, in some cases, the State. They stand back, not recognising the weak person also deserves to be looked after and to be nurtured by society. The Bill is about ensuring people can come together to act as one for the common good. I would appreciate if the Government would change its mind and support the Bill for that very reason.

I congratulate Deputy Ó Laoghaire on bringing it forward but the House is doing the Deputy a disservice because there was no pre-legislative scrutiny of this set of important proposals. It will be debated in two hours - I have ten minutes - and the committee will do pre-legislative scrutiny after a major part of the legislative procedure has been dealt with. That is wrong. This important set of proposals should have been considered by the committee, as all Government Bills have to be first. Deputy Penrose spoke about calling for submissions and so forth. Having spent five years doing this kind of work at the justice committee, I know its value and that it is extremely useful. The pre-legislative report should be brought to the House to allow all Members have the benefit of that work. However, we are not doing this and we are flying blind in many ways.

It would be far more valuable if that process had happened. However, it has not. I am on the Sub-committee on Dáil Reform where I have made the point again and again that good ideas like those suggested in the Bill need to be dealt with properly. We are not doing that, however. Instead, we are doing the Bill a disservice. The Bill could have serious flaws or serious ideas but we are missing them because we only have two hours. I only have ten minutes to respond to a whole load of ideas. I would like to debate this properly, but we cannot because the time is gone in two hours. Other Bills go on for days and we can reflect upon them. That is not the case with this Bill. The Bill's sponsors claim it is based on the 2005 Law Reform Commission report on multi-party actions. There is an important difference, however. The Law Reform Commission proposed new draft rules for the superior courts on multi-party litigation. This Bill just copies and pastes this. It runs against the preference and recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in 2005 to deal with the multi-party action issue by rules of court rather than primarily by new legislation. A most important element of the Law Reform Commission is omitted, namely, the requirement that any person joining a multi-party action scheme agrees at, or before, the time they join it on the terms of any settlement agreement. By arbitrarily repurposing draft rules of court as primary legislation, the Bill is making something of a direct legislative intervention in the internal affairs and case management of the court and in the exercise by judges of their traditional functions. Such rules, I would contend, are the sole competence of the court rule-making bodies. We have had the opportunity to debate the Bill to some extent, while also recognising the motivation for its introduction as providing a possible means of collective legal redress for groups of people who would be affected by such issues as the tracker mortgages scandal. While opposing the Bill for the reasons set out earlier by my colleague, the Government has sought not to be dismissive of the Bill in its intent. Rather an effort has been made to point out the complex issues which need to be dealt with in ensuring we come up with a framework for multi-party actions which is right for this jurisdiction, as well as for the people who will come to rely on it. As the various exchanges have shown, even with the best will in the world, this is no easy task to complete. We have another set of rules, the Constitution, to which no Member referred.

However, it is important we refer to the constitutionality of legislation and the risks associated. Once we contemplate reforms that relate to the administration of justice within the courts system, we have to be extra vigilant. It may well be that the Law Reform Commission's vision of a rules of court approach to the reform of the multi-party action area will continue to be the best one to take. There is no instant solution for the introduction of multi-party actions, despite how pressing the case for them may be at this time. We now have a process available to us which can inform us on the best way in which we can progress the multi-party action issue. This also involves the Law Reform Commission intention on the existing group action approaches taken before the courts. As the Law Reform Commission recommended, any reform in this area should be based on principles of procedural fairness, efficiency and access to justice. In particular, there should be active case management of such cases by the courts in keeping with the general trend in the reform of civil procedure. The multi-party action conceived by the commission was intended to operate as a flexible tool to deal collectively with cases which are sufficiently similar.The Law Reform Commission also recommended that a new multi-party action procedure should operate on the basis of an opt-in system whereby individual litigants would be included in the group only if they decided to join the group action. That is very different from the US class action procedure in which individuals are deemed to be part of the class action unless they opt out of it. There is much to consider in that regard. The Law Reform Commission report of 2005 was not carried forward by the Government at the time nor by its successors. In hindsight, that was, perhaps, a missed opportunity. The hesitancy was largely driven by an underlying concern about the potential cost burden on the Exchequer given that, as the then Minister surmised, the State would be the main object of claims. However, as has been acknowledged, the relevant policy considerations have changed in the period since the publication of the Law Reform Commission report in 2005. Multi-party actions have been road-tested in several common law jurisdictions, as Members have said, including England and Wales. The referral of the question of the introduction of a multi-party action procedure in the Irish legal system for consideration by the Honourable Mr. Justice Peter Kelly as part of the review of a civil justice administration is, therefore, a timely opportunity for us to deal with the matter in its broader civil justice setting. The initiative of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, in that regard, as agreed by Government today, meets other parties to the debate halfway. It will provide a platform to identify the various issues that need to be tackled in opening up the possibility of the introduction of a scheme for multi-party actions in this jurisdiction. Mention has been made of tracker mortgages and I wish to respond to some points made in this regard. The fair treatment of consumer borrowers is a key requirement of the financial services regulatory framework and the Central Bank consumer protection code. That requires all residential mortgage lenders to act honestly and fairly in the best interests of their customers and not to mislead customers about the products they provide. It also requires lenders to make a full disclosure of all relevant information to a consumer in a way that seeks to inform him or her and enable him or her to make an informed decision before entering into or changing a loan or other financial services agreement. Since 2008, the Central Bank has warned lenders of their duty to act in the best interests of their customers when recommending that a borrower switch from a tracker mortgage to another mortgage product. It announced in October 2015 that it had commenced a broader industry-wide examination of tracker mortgage related issues that covered, among other things, transparency in communication and the contractual rights of tracker mortgage borrowers. The examination is the largest review ever carried out by the consumer protection side of the Central Bank. It covered 15 mortgage lenders who may have sold a tracker mortgage product to a consumer borrower from the time the lender commenced selling tracker mortgages until December 2015. The Central Bank subsequently confirmed that tracker issues have arisen in respect of 11 of those lenders. The second phase of the examination involved an extensive internal review of mortgage books to identify mortgage borrowers who were impacted by banks' failings. It was due to be finalised by the end of last September. However, in its latest update, published last month, on the progress of the tracker mortgage examination, the Central Bank indicated that 13,000 impacted mortgage borrowers had been identified up to that point, although it was noted that number was expected to increase, which it did, as Members know. The other two phases of the Central Bank examination cover the calculation and payment of redress and compensation for impacted customers. The Central Bank has always made clear that those phases can run concurrently with phase two, but as yet redress and compensation have only been paid to a minority of impacted tracker borrowers. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, met the chief executives of the five main banks at the end of October and made it clear to them that all affected customers are to be identified and the wrongs are to be put right by means of payment of appropriate redress and compensation without any further undue delay. The Government is also determined that a range of follow-up actions will be pursued to ensure banks stand by those commitments. Banks must now actively and constructively engage with the Central Bank and provide all information required within the timeline set by the regulator. The existing supervision and enforcement powers of the Central Bank are strong and should be used to punish wrongdoing where supported by evidence. Thus far, the Central Bank has imposed a monetary penalty of €4.5 million on Springboard Mortgage Limited for serious failings in its obligations to its tracker mortgage customers. It is also pursuing enforcement investigations in respect of PTSB, Ulster Bank and others. It is also liaising with and has statutory reporting obligations to the Garda Síochána and other relevant statutory bodies in the case that information obtained by it at any stage prior to, during or after investigation gives rise to a suspicion that a criminal act may have been committed. The Government will be monitoring the progress and outcome of that important Central Bank examination very carefully and will consider further policy actions if necessary. Some tracker mortgage customers have been disgracefully treated by mortgage lenders and many borrowers have incurred considerable loss, in particular those who have lost their homes directly or indirectly as a result of the harmful action of lenders. I assure the House that the Government is fully aware of the seriousness of the matter and wishes to have adequate redress and compensation provided to impacted consumers as quickly as possible. The Government supports and encourages the Central Bank to complete its tracker mortgage investigation as quickly as possible.

I am encouraged that the criticisms of the Bill made by the Government are relatively easily addressed. The majority are in respect of context and approach and there is no substantive criticism of the approach or policy intended. We can take encouragement in that regard for how the Bill will proceed through Committee Stage if the Dáil supports it on Second Stage.

I appreciate the Minister of State is not currently a member of a committee but that step has become part of the new politics the Government is so keen to extol. It is possible for us to deal with all of the issues raised by the Government at pre-legislative scrutiny. The first of the Government's primary objections to the legislation is that it may not be entirely suitable for the resolution of the tracker mortgage issue. We are setting up a model. I have instanced the tracker mortgage as perhaps the most obvious contemporary example of a large-scale injustice involving common issues of fact or law such that a multi-party action would be germane to and suitable for those wishing to take a case to the courts. It may not be the best approach but is a potentially suitable example. It would be for the potential litigants and the appointed judge evaluating the application to decide whether it would be a suitable approach. Regardless of whether the tracker mortgage is a suitable case and whether individuals had a case that satisfied the appointed judge, the model would still stand on its merits and have application to a wider range of areas. The second substantial criticism is that time has moved on since the Law Reform Commission report. In reality, very little has moved on. There has been no change to relevant legislation and the Government has done nothing on the issue. There has been very little commentary about it or progress on it and there has been no relevant legislative change in Ireland. The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, said that:[C]onsideration needs to be given to the relevant intervening developments that have taken place at national, European Union and wider international levels. This includes our neighbouring jurisdictions of England and Wales, where group litigation orders have been in place for the past 15 years and from where valuable lessons regarding multi-party actions may be learned.That is incorrect because those developments did not occur in the intervening period. The Law Reform Commission paper specifically references those group litigation orders, which pre-date the 2003 and 2005 consultation papers. The developments, therefore, were already taken into consideration. The third criticism offered by the Government is that the Bill may be based too closely on the proposals of the Law Reform Commission. Not much can be said on that issue. The fourth criticism, which is in respect of the rules of court, is probably the most substantial issue dealt with by the Ministers of State, Deputies Byrne and Stanton.A number of issues need to be addressed in this regard. The first is that 12 years have passed and neither the Superior Courts Rules Committee nor the Government has done anything about this. I received a lengthy response from the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to the question on whether the Government had taken any action on this. The upshot of the response was, "As such, I will continue to bear it in mind for discussion and possible action in the general context of any upcoming reforms in the civil justice area." There are no plans to deal with this on the part of either the Superior Courts Rules Committee or Government. This has implications for administration, but the costs for litigants, the manner in which a case is taken and the ability of litigants to take cases clearly constitute an area of public policy. It is very clearly within the purview of this House to make decisions in this area. How else should those Members of the House who wish to advance the case for multi-party actions do so except by way of legislation? Another point I will make is that the only reason the Law Reform Commission supports the making of these changes to the rules of court is that this was Government policy at the time. There is no legislative or constitutional requirement for it and no statement to the effect that it would be in any way problematic. I instance the fact that much legislation passed by recent Governments and more far-off Governments, including the previous Government, makes changes to the manner in which cases are heard in respect of procedure. Such legislation amounts to public policy decisions and usually contains provisions such as those found in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which made significant changes to the way in which compensation cases were managed in the courts. Section 9 includes a provision that states:Nothing in this Act shall be construed as limiting or reducing the power of an authority, having (for the time being) power to make rules regulating the practice and procedure of a court, to—(a) make ... rules.This legislation came from the Minister of State's Department; much legislation does. The power is given to the Superior Courts Rules Committee by primary legislation. There is nothing in the Constitution that says the rules of court are set by the Superior Courts Rules Committee. The power is given to the committee by this House because it is in the interest of the people who deal regularly with the day-to-day changes in regulation and administration. The power rests with this House. It is practice that large areas have been delegated to the committee, but there is nothing legislatively, constitutionally or otherwise restricting this House from making such changes to the way in which the courts conduct their business. If we make a decision that we want cases to be heard in this way, it is absolutely within our gift. I wish to respond to some of the other key points raised by other Deputies and the Minister of State. The point about potential variability was raised. I believe that sections 5 and 8 and the possibility for separation of the common and the diverse issues within the case can deal with that. Deputy Harty made the point that people might not be in a position to take separate actions but, as the Minister of State has acknowledged, the model involved here is an opt-in one. Therefore, people would be at liberty to take their own cases individually if they so wished, and that option would be open to them. Deputy Penrose instanced his own Bill, which he intends to progress at some stage. We will engage with suggestions made by Deputies Penrose, Jack Chambers and Harty and other Deputies regarding amendments. I wish to quote the remarks Mrs. Justice Denham made at the launch of the report. She said: It is in the State's interest, and in the interest of litigants, to embrace a form of multi-party procedure. The report does not recommend removing the current private multi-party procedures, the representative action and the test case. Rather it recommends providing an alternative, additional approach. The Report while considering the matter practically is imaginative.That is a belief I hold. This is fundamentally about access to justice and the better administration of how cases are heard in the courts where there are large categories of people affected by an injustice. It is about giving people the tools to take cases where previously they have been prevented from doing so because of the cost of litigation and representation. The Bill levels the field in their favour, and I hope the Dáil will support it in the vote on Thursday. I ask the Government, in the spirit of that new politics to which I have referred, whether it agrees with the legislation or not, to take the view of the Dáil on board and work with the select committee to improve the legislation, bring it into line with proper legislative procedure and tighten it up.
