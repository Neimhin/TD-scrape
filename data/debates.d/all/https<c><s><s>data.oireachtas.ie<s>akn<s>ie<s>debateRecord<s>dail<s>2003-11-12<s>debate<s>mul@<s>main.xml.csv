#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I raise the plight of first-time house buyers, given the announcement that new charges will range between €6,000 and €28,000 for development works on new houses. Two years ago a first-time house buyer was able to get a €3,000 new house grant, but that was abolished and replaced with a 1% increase in VAT to 13.5% for building materials. Now such buyers face an extra charge of between €6,000 and €28,000. This means that if an average of €10,000 is charged on each of the 50,000 houses being built, that is a direct stealth tax of €500 million which used to be funded from the public capital programme. If 60,000 houses are built, then €600 million will be raised by this direct stealth tax.Young couples or first-time buyers making arrangements for borrowings of €130,000 or €150,000, now have to raise an extra €25,000 to €30,000. Under the stewardship of the Taoiseach and his Government, house prices have doubled in the last two years and he is now directly imposing serious, crucifying stealth charges on new house buyers and on young couples in particular. How can he stand over this? How does it measure up to his own statements about wanting more houses in rural Ireland and wanting everyone to have the opportunity to own their own home? This decision, brought in two years ago by Deputy Cullen, means there is an imposition of between €500 million and €600 million in stealth charges directly on new house owners and young couples. Where does the Taoiseach stand on that and what does he propose to do about it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1	We should acknowledge that the construction industry and Government policies are dealing very adequately with the supply of houses for the first time in a long while, with over 60,000 houses being built.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	3	That is the highest number of houses per thousand people in any country in Europe and it is an extraordinary achievement for the Government to be dealing with this all over the country.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	7	For Deputy Kenny's information, development charges have been part of the planning system in Ireland since its introduction since 1964. They pay for local authority infrastructure necessary for new developments, so this did not come in three years ago but in 1964. Due to widespread inconsistency in their application, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government – it was Deputy Dempsey, not Deputy Cullen – brought in the Planning and Development Act. He introduced new provisions requiring local authorities to prepare schemes setting out how development contributions would apply in their area. The final decision on the amounts levied under these schemes is a matter for the elected representatives in local councils.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The new power was granted to councillors under the Planning and Development Act 2000 under which the money is ring-fenced to pay for facilities servicing new developments. It cannot be used to pay for any other issue such as benchmarking or other local authority services.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Development charges pay for the local authority infrastructure necessary to facilitate new developments, such as roads, sewerage services and other amenities. The system of charging development contributions under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963 was widely criticised as being too haphazard, unevenly applied across the country and totally lacking in transparency. It was suggested frequently in this House that the system should be amended, therefore new provisions were brought in under the Planning and Development Act 2000 whereby local authorities have to prepare schemes setting out how development contributions will apply to their area. This is an attempt to bring order to the new system and I hope it does so. The Act also expanded the types of facility and infrastructure which could be provided using development contributions to include recreational and community facilities – cycle ways and so on.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The Taoiseach and his Government were supposed to come up with a way of dealing with house prices but that is not what he is doing here. It is perfectly obvious that the only decentralisation we will have from the Government is decentralisation of the tax burden. I am grateful to the Taoiseach for his clarification as to who introduced this, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, or the Minister, Deputy Cullen, as confusion reigns abroad because Ministers in the Government seem to abdicate collective responsibility whenever steel is required. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister, Deputy Walsh, are against the smoking regulations, the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, has dispensed with the Hanly report and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, contradicts the Taoiseach in terms of the price of land.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	19	There is no division between the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, on budgets – they are at one on that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Taoiseach promised to deal with house prices for young couples. In two years the position has moved from a point where a €3,000 grant was available to them to it being abolished and replaced by a 1% increase in building materials and VAT followed by a stealth charge of between €6,000 and €28,000. The Taoiseach has failed to deal with a central issue for thousands of people across the country and, in that sense, the Government has been an appalling disaster. The Government has blown the money in recent years that was available for these kinds of developments. It is not the developers who are contributing to this infrastructural development but the person who will have to pay these stealth charges. A sum of €600 million will have to be paid in development charges for houses followed by extra charges because local authorities will not be funded for their benchmarking requirements by central Government. In that context, will the Government decide to contribute or pay the benchmarking element of €160 million to local authorities to save young people and first-time buyers from being imposed on or penalised by even further stealth charges as we move into next year?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I must again make the point – Deputy Kenny would not want the facts to be known – that we are providing more houses for our citizens—

The best we ever achieved was 35,000 houses.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Under the Planning and Development Act, we expanded the type of facilities and infrastructure which could be provided using development contribution schemes. That measure was limited for years in that it could be used only for roads and sewerage schemes. It was correct that in the development of an estate proper facilities should be available. The development contribution schemes now include recreation and communities facilities and other leisure facilities and schemes, and this is a good measure.

On Aer Rianta, the Government has been dishonest with the people, untruthful with those who work in Aer Rianta and misleading of the people in the regions. No business case has been made out for the proposed changes at Aer Rianta and no business plan, not even a screed of paper, has been made available by the Minister, Deputy Brennan.The PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which I brought into this House a week ago, shows clearly that on its figures Shannon is not viable as a stand-alone airport and Cork is a loss-maker.

How can he reconcile autonomy within the Aer Rianta structure with stand-alone status for Shannon and Cork? Does it mean anything other than an attempt to muddy the waters, or is the Taoiseach rowing back? Is he going for autonomy within the Aer Rianta structure or is the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and Michael O'Leary pulling his strings? What is the business case for this move and why is the Taoiseach not honest with the workers in Aer Rianta and the people of the regions?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	72	—last July when the overall policy issue was decided and again recently when the Cabinet approved the heads of the airport Bill. As is standard practice in memoranda to Government, the documents laid out in detail both sides of the argument contained in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has made clear, inside and outside the Cabinet, that he is fully supportive of the restructuring measures. He and his Department remain supportive of them, but requested, as they should do, that complex issues arising from the restructuring, such as capitalisation, transfer of debt, the future of subsidiaries, shared services, security of employment and terms and conditions of pension entitlements, all of which are important for the staff, are resolved before the Minister finalises the legislation establishing the three independent and fully autonomous State airport authorities.I confirm this was a Government memorandum, I believe it was the first memorandum. There were two documents, one of which was left at a meeting, which was picked up by a journalist and returned last Christmas, and another one was attached to a document that was circulated. However, this is the first one that has vanished from a Department and a Garda investigation commenced this morning to establish how Deputy Rabbitte got this document. Whether it was taken, given over or stolen will be investigated in due course.

Drafting is proceeding along these lines. However, the issues can be resolved. There are ongoing meetings with the company and the trade unions on them. Consultants will advise the Department on how best to resolve these complex issues. I repeat what I said last week, that when market-sensitive issues are removed from the documents, they will be shared with the trade unions and staff representatives of Aer Rianta, and the Government has no difficulty with that.

On the contrary, the Minister remains committed to maintain support for the regional airports. Almost €20 million is spent subsidising them. The PSOs are not deemed to be State aids. They are EU-sanctioned and are exempt from State aid. It is not true, as Deputy Rabbitte asserted, that State airports would lose their status if there was a transfer of the debt.Irrespective of the restructuring process, there are issues regarding the regional airports that need to be addressed and the Minister will deal with them. The Government's position was dealt with properly in Cabinet. The Minister for Transport has up to five reports and I have seen them. He is prepared to share these with Aer Rianta representatives. Deputy Rabbitte may have been given these documents, but it is my understanding that Aer Rianta staff already have them. The Minister for Transport is prepared to share them with all the staff and not just a few.

Why does the Taoiseach now say casually that he is in favour of full autonomy and independent stand-alone status for Shannon and Cork airports when he gave the impression yesterday that he was in favour of autonomy within the Aer Rianta structure?

Even the Taoiseach's friends must be increasingly concerned at the disarray in Cabinet. The leaking from Cabinet is not dissimilar to the fate of the Prestige which, a year ago, went to the bottom of the sea and continues to leak to this day. We have had examples of action concerning leaks, particularly from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who has forcefully threatened the Garda Síochána that it will have a considerable price to pay if its members leak information. What will the Taoiseach do to stop leaks from senior advisers and the Cabinet on matters such as the Aer Rianta report, where the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, said considerable forces are working to undermine his plans to remove the State airports' monopoly?Is the reaction to the Hanly report by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, an example of gross disobedience by a member of the Cabinet and a lack of Government accountability and cohesion? In a normal Government, would the position of the Minister for Defence not be untenable?

Which Government are we to take seriously in this regard? Is there a different Government working within Fianna Fáil? Is the smoking ban an example of this, with the Ministers, Deputies Walsh and Cullen, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, speaking from different policy platforms? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, have different views on the redress board and there are differences between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance on funding for Punchestown. Does the Taoiseach not have a serious job to do in investigating this matter?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The Deputy referred to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on Aer Rianta. This was a report requested by Aer Rianta to assist it in this analysis. It is not a policy document and does not have policy conclusions. The memorandum for Government was leaked which, in the first instance, as I have said, will be investigated by the Secretary General of the Department. If the Secretary General feels it has to go further, then obviously it would be a matter for the Garda.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	137	The Taoiseach should bring in the Garda.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I am outlining the procedure. Does the Deputy want the Garda to come in first? I know what the Deputy will say.The Government has accepted in principle the core conclusions of the Hanly report that compliance with the European working time directive requires a consultant provided model of acute service delivery in place of the present largely non-consultant hospital doctor provided model. That is the main decision. A fundamental reorganisation in acute hospital services is required to provide a safe and high quality service for patients. The proposed changes must proceed in a way that safeguard the training element of the non-consultant hospital doctors' role and the reforms must be subject to achieving specific changes in non-consultant hospital doctor contracts. We approve the implementation of the report on the lines set out in the Hanly report taking geographics and demographics into consideration.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	146	No Government could bring forward a report on which nobody is entitled to bring forward a view.

The Minister totally accepts the Hanly report.

Is it not up to the Taoiseach to investigate that matter and answering that question? Is that not the Taoiseach's job? Will he investigate the leakage of the Aer Rianta report so that some belief in Cabinet confidentiality can be maintained? Will the Minister for Defence get an opportunity to make a statement on this matter? If we believe the Taoiseach, based on the impression from the newspapers, the Minister was telling big untruths in Tipperary and he does not have a problem with the Hanly report at all. However, the Minister said he did. Will the Taoiseach investigate what the Minister said and will the Taoiseach censure him if he said what he is reported to have said or will the Taoiseach just sack him at the next reshuffle? Will there be any honest investigation or will there be a cloak and dagger business at the next reshuffle?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	163	It is pointless for me to try to answer if people keep talking. I have one minute to answer two questions and I would like to answer them. Under the rules of the Cabinet Handbook, if a memorandum to Government is leaked as has happened in this case – we know the text used yesterday is from the Cabinet document – it is up to the Department that instigated the memorandum to have it investigated through the Secretary General. The Secretary General then, obviously, uses the assistance of the Garda. That is the procedure. That procedure has already started this morning. That is the answer to the first question.On the second question on the Hanly report, for the benefit of the House, I have given the contents of the Government decision and the Minister for Defence has signed up to that in the same way that I have. He has confirmed that to me. If people listened they would have heard me give the various sections and say on the record that we approved the implementation of the report on the lines set out in the memorandum taking geographics and demographics into consideration. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, gave his view on an aspect of the geographics, which was—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I propose to take Questions Nos.1 to 27, inclusive, together.I met with the Prime Minister of Bahrain, Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa, at a working lunch in Government Buildings on Friday, 3 October 2003. Our discussions covered a broad range of issues including bilateral trade relations between our two countries, the Middle East peace process, EU Gulf Co-operation Council relations and Iraq. The discussions were mutually informative and helpful. During the prime minister's two-day visit to Ireland, he also met with President McAleese, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and the Minister for Transport. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan and Bahrain's deputy prime minister, signed an air transport agreement, strengthening the links between our two countries.On 4 October, I attended the meeting of Heads of State or Government in Rome to formally launch the Intergovernmental Conference. At that meeting, I made it clear to my colleagues that the draft treaty prepared by the Convention offered a good basis for the work of the Intergovermental Conference. I also expressed my strong support for the Italian Presidency in its efforts to steer the Intergovernmental Conference to a successful and early conclusion.Ireland has a number of key concerns which I outlined at the meeting. On taxation, we strongly believe that unanimity should continue to apply, as in the present treaties. Tax decisions are fundamental to the relationship between citizens and their elected national governments.On Justice and Home Affairs, we want to ensure that the distinctive legal traditions of member states are fully respected, above all in the area of criminal procedure. It is also important that the Intergovernmental Conference has a thorough discussion of security and defence issues. These issues are sensitive and important and were not considered in enough detail by the Convention. Only when there is a shared understanding among all the 25 member states of what they entail can proper consideration be given to their place in the draft treaty. There are other matters on which we are making a contribution as they arise.Following the meeting of Heads of State or Government, I attended a lunch hosted by the Italian President, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. While in Rome, I had the opportunity to discuss the ongoing political situation in Northern Ireland with Prime Minister Blair on the margins of the summit.Later that day, I met the Dutch Prime Minister, Jan Peter Balkenende. This meeting was part of a series of bilateral contacts with my counterparts in advance of Ireland's Presidency next year. Our discussions focused on a range of European and international issues of mutual concern. We also had a very useful discussion on Presidency issues, and in particular on co-operation between the Irish and the Dutch Presidencies next year.On 16 and 17 October, I attended the European Council meeting in Brussels. I was accompanied by my colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Roche.The conclusions of the European Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and, as Deputies are aware, on Thursday, 23 October, the earliest opportunity following the meeting, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on my behalf, made a comprehensive statement on the outcome of the Council. I do not, therefore, propose to go into too much detail again today.In brief, the European Council allowed the Heads of State or Government of the European Union to take stock of developments in the Intergovernmental Conference; review trends in the European economy and appoint a new Governor of the European Central Bank; take steps to ensure that our borders are not exploited by traffickers; and review a range of external relations issues. The meeting was a success and I am satisfied that the groundwork being laid by the Italian Presidency, will enable us to further advance the agenda of the European Union during our Presidency in the first half of next year.In terms of my bilateral contacts on the margins of the European Council, I once again had the opportunity to meet with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to discuss the latest political developments in Northern Ireland. Also as part of the ongoing series of Pre-Presidency bilateral contacts with my counterparts, I met with Prime Minister Juncker of Luxembourg. Our discussions covered a range of issues including the Irish Presidency and the Lisbon Agenda.I met with the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, in Government Buildings on 22 October. I took the opportunity to brief the President on the current state of Ireland's Presidency preparations. We had a very useful exchange of views on the Lisbon Agenda, which will be a major priority for us during our Presidency, and we also touched on a range of other issues in the European context, including future financial perspectives and the Intergovernmental Conference.In relation to the location of the European Council meetings scheduled during Ireland's Presidency, it was agreed at Nice that once the European Union included more than 18 member states, all future European Councils would be held in Brussels. The Italian Presidency is holding its European Council meetings in Brussels and, as the first country to preside over the newly enlarged Union, we will do likewise. I have, however, invited the other Heads of State or Government to Dublin for a ceremonial event to celebrate enlargement on 1 May 2004.If the Italian Presidency manages, as we hope, to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, the key priorities of the Presidency agenda will be to ensure a successful transition from a Union of 15 to one of 25, including the effective and efficient conduct of the business of the enlarged Union and to carry forward the enlargement process more generally; to give additional impetus to the 10-year reform goal set out at Lisbon in March 2000 – the primary forum for discussion of the Lisbon Agenda is the Spring European Council; to take forward commitments in the Justice and Home Affairs area by focusing on the delivery of agreed commitments in terms of the requirements under the Amsterdam Treaty which remain outstanding and the broader Tampere programme; and in the external relations arena, to continue and deepen dialogue in the search for mutual solutions to the many difficult issues confronting us on the world stage.In my capacity as President of the European Council, I have been invited by President Bush to attend the G8 Summit in Georgia in the United States next May. The agenda for the summit is in the process of development.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Does the Taoiseach expect the Intergovernmental Conference to conclude before the Irish Presidency? With specific regard to the reference he made to tax harmonisation, is he satisfied that the Irish position will prevail? Do I get the impression that the British Government is moderating its position on this critical issue?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	169	On the first question, I just do not know. The Italians are making a determined effort to progress the work on the Intergovernmental Conference. There was a two-day meeting of foreign affairs ministers on Monday and Tuesday of this week. It made progress, but it is slow. I am meeting Silvio Berlusconi tonight for two hours. At least I will get an overview of how he sees the various parts falling into place. By that I mean the ECOFIN Council has taken forward its work and made a presentation to the Italians as to what it believes should be in the Intergovernmental Conference. Not exactly the same but a similar exercise is entailed in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, which has been coming forward. Then there is the overall issue across a range of areas. Throughout a number of meetings on Europe, people have been coming to Mr. Berlusconi, who has been trying to make that assessment. I will be in a better position tonight to find out what he believes.The plan, as of now, is that the bilateral meetings with foreign affairs ministers will continue. They are now on a daily and weekend basis. On 28 and 29 November, a little over a fortnight from now, there will be a final meeting of that process to see where they are at. That will still be two weeks before the Council. There is a view that the Italians – and I would be surprised if this is not the case – will not conclude it, but at least it will be well advanced. They will probably do a composite constitutional treaty at that stage and then bring it to the summit meeting. Then it is a question of whether the summit will attempt to finalise it or not.Deputy Rabbitte will recall that the French endeavoured to make that same arrangement at Nice. Nice did reach a conclusion, but it was difficult and rancorous. I am not too sure of the best way of doing things, but perhaps there is not an alternative. That meeting went on for 96 hours, more or less non-stop, which certainly was not a good idea. There was very little time for a break. I am not sure whether that is the Italian agenda, but I should have a better assessment tonight.On the second issue, I do not think the British have switched their position. I know there was a report some weeks ago that Chancellor Gordon Brown had changed his position, but he has made strong statements on a number of occasions since. We were told that the report was a misrepresentation and that the British position is extremely strong. Not many other countries share our position. There are a few. The Swedes take a line similar to Ireland's, but not as strong. I had the experience at Nice that when it came to the crunch it was ourselves and the British. Luxembourg takes it from a different perspective.On my tour in recent months I noted that a number of countries, especially accession countries, take a strong position and believe that taxation should be dealt with only by unanimity. Many of them have changed their systems in recent years or are restructuring their economies and do not want to see a change in the position. As I forecast in the Dáil a few weeks ago, this will once again be a fight because those countries that do not share our view are very determined on this, as they were on the previous occasion and have been since Maastricht. They have not changed their position. Even in countries where the Prime Minister has changed – and that has been in many countries – the system has not changed. The same line has been raised since I was Minister for Finance ten years ago.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	170	It goes without saying that the implications for our industrial strategy of a change in this area in the medium-term would be serious. Will the Taoiseach list the principal issues on which the Government has concerns in respect of the draft constitution arising from the Convention?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Taxation is one issue and it has been discussed. In the area of justice and home affairs a number of issues arise because our legal system is different. It is, by and large, the same as that in Cyprus, Malta and the UK. It is different from the other European countries, especially in terms of criminal law. We have difficulties in many justice and home affairs areas. As I stated earlier, these discussions are ongoing. The Justice and Home Affairs Ministers do not have the same united position as ECOFIN but are trying to make a presentation on this issue.On institutional issues, we have an open mind as the discussions continue provided that there is equality of treatment for member states. There are many arguments and debates about the type of institutional change that could happen. I was happy with the Nice treaty and am also happy with the provisions of the Convention provided there are no inbuilt changes to make either a two-tier Commission or to move away from equality of treatment.I fear that, if the large countries move on the issue of one commissioner per member state, they will then argue for a return to their having two commissioners each. There is a real fear of that. I have endeavoured to explain to smaller countries that it is not in their interest to support this position because the argument in Nice was about obtaining equity of treatment. I think they understand the argument but many of them, especially the newer accession countries, see having their own commissioner as being more important.I do not see it that way. While I believe having a commissioner is achievable and that France, Germany and other countries would be happy enough to achieve it, they would quickly try to arrange a return to having a small central group of which the large countries would be part and the other countries would have rotatating membership but without equality of treatment. We successfully fought that in discussions on the Nice treaty and in the Convention, but it is a fight and a considerable one that is still to happen.Even though it was not our proposal, the Presidency of the European Council is something with which we are broadly happy. Some issues around it have still to be worked out but they are only details.The same is true of the Union Foreign Minister. While I do not have a difficulty with the principle, I do not see the sense in the Union Foreign Minister chairing and having responsibility for the General Affairs Council because he is answerable to it. We believe that a member state should continue to do that. This makes more sense for the simple reason that to have the Union Foreign Minister chairing the committee to which he is answerable does not seem to be an accountable way of operating. There is support for our position but we are in the minority. The larger countries do not see a difficulty with the proposal. I have my own suspicions, which I will not air, on why that is the position. I do not agree with the stance because it is not a logical way of conducting business.These are the central issues. There are many other detailed issues on which we are involved in discussions but I do not think they will be major. The major issues will concern matters such as taxation and justice and home affairs which is increasingly becoming a significant issue. Five years ago justice and home affairs issues did not take up half an hour of a meeting, of which the Deputy will be aware from his group. They are increasingly taking up a large part of the agenda and will take up an enormous part of our Presidency because of the completion of Amsterdam and Tampere and because they form a significant part of the charter. These are the main important issues that remain outstanding.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	172	On a day when we discuss the deployment of Irish troops on a peace enforcement mission in Liberia, does the Taoiseach not agree that it is farcical that Ireland cannot participate in the ongoing EU-sponsored mission in Macedonia? Does he have a view on that?Is the Taoiseach in a position to clear up the confusion that exists about the European Union's policy in regard to the provision of central crash barriers on motorways? Is it the position that the Commission believes that such barriers are right and that they provide the best degree of safety but that this advice is being ignored by the National Roads Authority?Can the Taoiseach confirm that Irish officials are concerned about Ireland not being able to play its full part in the new EU border agency which was approved yesterday? Will he comment on the implications of this for Ireland? The Taoiseach will be aware that Ireland has not participated in the Schengen agreement of a number of years ago because Britain did not join it as it has implications in terms of passport controls at the Border.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	173	There has been some relaxation on the Schengen agreement. As the British have moved on this position, we have moved as well for the obvious reason and that will continue. The British position is moving on that and, as they move for the obvious and useful reason, we will do the same.I do not know what is the case in regard to the crash barriers issue. I do not wish to give the Deputy an answer that will mislead him. I am not aware of having been briefed on the European position. The NRA installed a crash barrier on the new motorway that opened in the Glen of the Downs which, in its view, is the one we should use.On the issue of Liberia and the decision to send troops there in contrast to Macedonia, it was hoped that we would be involved and participate in Macedonia. All these issues have to be examined by the Attorney General because of the constitutional position and the triple lock. His interpretation was that the previous UN mandate was not the same as the subsequent one and he could not state that it was a UN-mandated mission. Had it been, we would have been able to involve ourselves in it. It was unfortunate, as that was a borderline case. However, that is our constitutional position.I admit that the Defence Act is old and, as the UN looks increasingly to the regions, in this case Europe, to take autonomy for missions and the forces involved in them, this issue will arise more often. This means that, in some cases, we will have to examine the Defence Act, but we must be clear in each case. That would not create an argument with those who have been opposed to the measure. The UN made the decision beforehand and adopted a very clear position. It would have asked us, as Kofi Annan has in the case of Liberia. As the UN asked the EU and the EU asked us, it is a bit much to say we were not asked by the UN. Until we rectify that, we cannot change the position. We will not break away from the triple lock as to do so would open the entire debate again.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	174	Does the Taoiseach agree it was careless to fail to refer the EU proposal to fund human embryo research to the Joint Committee on European Affairs as is required by law? Will the Taoiseach ensure this does not happen again? Will the Taoiseach comment on the likely Government response when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment attends the meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 27 November, given that two Oireachtas committees agreed that Ireland should not support the funding of embryo research on the basis that that sufficient scientific advances are being made in stem cell research from umbilical chords and adult stem cells?Given daily events in Iraq and the fact that the complex relations between Palestine and Israel is central to the severe difficulties of the region, will the Taoiseach, as incoming President of the European Council, make an issue of this? If the Palestinian-Israeli conflict were resolved somewhat, it would have a very beneficial effect on the entire middle eastern region. Given the serious consequences of events in Iraq, the PalestinianIsraeli conflict should be a priority for the Presidency. Will the Taoiseach comment on that?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will attend the joint committee in the next week or so before the sixth framework directive is discussed. We do not know what the Commission will put forward. There has been a great deal of lobbying and discussion on the matter and the EU Parliament has put forward more liberal views than did the Commission. The provisions of the sixth framework were already law. At issue was the moratorium which was intended to last until the end of this year. We supported the group which wanted to see tighter controls and procedures. If the moratorium runs out at the end of the year, the question is whether another will be introduced or a more liberal position will be adopted. We will just have to await the outcome of the discussions.Our basic position all year has been that nothing in this affected the Irish stance. We were not involved in this. It was not compatible with anything we would or could do. We were not in the business of coercing others or directing what they did. We held that this kind of research could not happen in our country and while we protected that position, we did not adopt the authoritarian view that we should tell others what to do. We are concerned about what will happen at the end of the year and about the regulations that will be laid down, and that continues to be the position.On Iraq, Deputy Kenny is correct. The poisonous element in all the relationships in the region emanates from the Israeli-Palestinian issue. After the Iraqi war commenced there was a great drive by the European Union and many other parts of the world to get the Americans to take an active involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and, to be fair, they have. I am on record as having said they should have done so earlier. The road map has been put in place although not much headway has been made and the situation continues to be poisonous. Ireland will continue to be involved. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will visit Israel shortly. He has already been in Palestine. We have made our position clear. We went to President Arafat despite the fact that it incurred wrath from certain quarters, but it had to be done to gain support. It does no good to blame any one faction. One should blame them all, which is fairer. None of the parties is blameless in this, but they definitely need the help of the USA and the European Union.The issue will continue to be a priority of our external relations agenda during the Presidency. Even in terms of the Troika this year it has continued to be a priority. Many meetings have centred around it. I met all the Arab ambassadors recently and had long discussions about their concerns and perspectives and ways in which we can help. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have met Mr. Javier Solana and we will continue to be actively engaged. Regardless of the difficulty, we must try to keep the road map in play. While the positions that have been adopted by both sides do not help, there is not much point telling the Palestinians they must resolve all the security issues and do everything asked of them by Mr. Sharon before progress can be made. It is simply not possible for the Palestinians to achieve that, though they must, of course, make an effort. We will continue to engage in this right up to Christmas and into our Presidency. I am well briefed by the EU and the UN and I am aware of the positions of America and others. I do not wish to give the impression that much progress is being made because, frankly, that is not the case.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	176	The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has told the House that the Italian Presidency is drawing together the views of member states on Article 40.7. This article provides for the establishment of mutual defence co-operation within the EU framework, in co-operation with NATO and between individual member states, once the constitution has been adopted and before the EU Council decides to establish EU mutual defence. Has the Irish position on this been developed and made known? Will it be discussed with this House before the Italians are given the information? Can the Taoiseach offer a view at this point as to what is our position?Is it not the case that the article in question makes nonsense of the constitutional amendment passed in the second referendum on the Nice treaty? The amendment provides that if the EU Council decides to establish a common defence, a referendum will have to take place here. As Article 40.7 puts into effect such an arrangement before the Council makes a decision, is there a constitutional and legal difficulty for the Government? Will the Taoiseach outline the Government position, if one exists, so that Members know what it is before Mr. Berlusconi?The EURATOM Treaty was removed from the body of the text of the draft constitution, but it is treated as a special case by way of Protocol. Has the Government asked for changes in this regard given the fact that the EURATOM Treaty is the only remaining sector specific treaty in the EU? We need to know what changes the Government has sought in light of the fact that the treaty continues to treat nuclear energy preferentially to the disadvantage of other energy sectors, including the renewable energy sector. What changes is the Government looking for in this regard and is it considering adding any other Irish protocols or EU treaties to the European constitution?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	177	Previous Irish protocols, such as that on abortion, will be re-enacted into the treaty on the constitution.In regard to EURATOM, the Deputy will recall from discussions I had with his colleague, Deputy Gormley, that we raised and pressed these issues because of its nuclear aspect. There has been discussion on the matter in the Convention on the Future of Europe, with which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been dealing. However, I have not had a chance to talk to him about it since last Monday or Tuesday. While it is outside of the Convention, the Deputy is correct that it is an issue which must be dealt with although I do not know how precisely it will be done. Together with Deputy Gormley and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, we have been making the case all year that the issue cannot be left aside – we must get a fixed position or some knowledge of it. However, I am not up to date with the position in regard to the discussion and I suggest the Deputy tables a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the matter.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	178	The Taoiseach can come back to me on it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The Deputy's first point concerned commitments to enhancing military capabilities to ensure that the EU can effectively undertake humanitarian and crisis management operations. As it stands, the EU's operational capability is constrained by certain shortfalls which must be rectified. Provision for an possible EU common defence is already contained in the current EU treaty, which is for decision by the EU Council, acting unanimously among member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. Ireland's position on such an arrangement is that, in accordance with the amendment to the Constitution last October, we cannot join an EU common defence without the approval of the people in a referendum.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Will the Government publish a White Paper outlining in detail the position on the draft constitution? There is an explanatory document but we do not have a point-by-point or clause-by-clause position paper from the Government outlining where it is at. There are massive gaps in our knowledge on the Government's position. The Taoiseach has already alluded to a change in the Government's prepared position in regard to the proposal for an EU commissioner for each state, which the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, had been pursuing.Does the Taoiseach agree with and accept Article 1.40. 2º, which states that the EU defence policy shall not prejudice NATO states and shall be compatible with the NATO? Does the Government accept this even though the special rights and responsibilities of militarily neutral states are not explicitly acknowledged in the treaty as it stands?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	181	As the Deputy stated, we have already published an explanatory document. When the treaty is completed, the Department of Foreign Affairs will publish a detailed document, as has been the case. In regard to EU commissioners, I am open to a number of suggestions, including the Nice and Convention arrangements and other alterations which have been put forward by other states and I am satisfied with them provided there is equality of treatment. Our issue is not so much what the arrangement is but rather that each country is dealt with equally and there is equality of treatment between member states. That is our key position.Neutral states are covered by clauses in existing treaties which will be re-enacted. There is no doubt about our position in regard to our non-membership of, and non-involvement with, NATO, therefore, there is no need for further tightening up. The debate in regard to the solidarity clause has been raised but the idea that, in the event of an emergency, the EU would be in a position to mobilise its assets and call on its members – civilian and military – is in keeping with our own traditions of crisis management as is the case in regard to the Petersberg Tasks. All our partners – Austria, Finland and Sweden – support that solidarity clause. We are not under threat in other areas but we will keep the matter under review, even though our position on NATO is totally understood.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	182	On the eve of Ireland's EU Presidency, will the Taoiseach indicate the number of legal actions which have been, or are in the course of being, initiated against Ireland by the European Commission for non-compliance with the implementation of EU regulations and directives? Is that the reason a list of barristers and legal personnel was recently circulated to all Departments with the intention that they be engaged in order to expedite compliance? Can the Taoiseach guarantee that, on the assumption of his Presidency of the EU, Ireland will be in compliance with all EU directives and regulations in order that, as the incoming President and Taoiseach, he will not be sued by the Commission in respect of legal obligations which we have to fulfil?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	183	The Deputy is correct. We circulated the list in order to get Departments up to date because of their case workload. For the past year, I have been trying to get all the directives as up to date as possible. We are narrowing the list each month and are now in a healthy position. There will always be on-going cases and legal actions in regard to breaches of one sort or another, mainly in regard to competition. However, we must keep them to a minimum and ensure we have enacted directives and instruments into our own legislation. We are endeavouring to do this and make sure the list is as short as possible.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I wish the Taoiseach well in the specific matter of tax harmonisation because of its importance to this country.Has the Government made any written submissions in respect of the Intergovernmental Conference and, if so, can they be laid before the House because, as most Deputies have remarked, we would like to see the detail? I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to an article in today's edition of The Irish Times which outlines concerns expressed by Sweden and Finland in regard to the specific proposal to allow a group of countries to come closer together in respect of defence matters. Sweden and Finland believe this could lead to tensions in Europe and they have expressed their position at greater length in a recent European newspaper article.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I thank the Deputy for his support on tax harmonisation because it has once again become a major issue. We have worked with Sweden and Finland and our position is the same. We do not agree with a group of countries trying to go ahead on their own. We have had that twice this year and I think it is to this the article refers. Towards the end of April, 28 April I think, France, Germany and Belgium came together and issued their position on defence, again trying to move ahead on their own. More recently France, Germany and Britain had discussions. These did not go very far because of the transatlantic relationship and Britain's position with NATO.For different reasons, we believe – and this is the view held by Austria, Finland and Sweden also – that on any changes, whether people participate, opt in or not, all the discussions should be transparent, there should be full engagement and the issue should be dealt with at the full European Council. They should not be side deals. Whether people opt in or participate is a matter for them under their own constitutional arrangements as set down in the EU treaty.One of my concerns for the future is that when 28 countries are involved – from 1 May 2004 Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey will attend many of the meetings – increasingly as the years pass three or four countries will have their own meeting or summit and take a line because they are frustrated with others. There is great fear of that happening with a group of 28. With the group of 15 it was just about tenable and with nine or 12 it was far easier. The bigger it gets the more difficult it is. The Deputy knows as well as I do the tendency of some countries to become frustrated with the process of having to go through the group arrangement. We are being strong on our position on defence. It is not perhaps about whether we can involve ourselves in these small groups but that they should not go off and make arrangements outside the European Council.One argument in favour of a President of the Council and an EU foreign affairs minister is that at least if we had someone permanently dealing with the issue he or she could drive the agenda and it would be their job in the future. It would be their job every day rather than having a rotating EU Presidency where one just puts in as much time as one can. There would be somebody there to control the European Council and keep it in line. If we do not have that position we will get three or four countries going off here, there and everywhere. This is a big challenge for the future.One of the issues of the Irish EU Presidency, which will not be resolved during that period, will be south-eastern Europe, the Balkan countries and Croatia. The determination of Croatia's candidacy comes during our EU Presidency, as will what is to happen with Bosnia Herzegovina and with some of the other countries.The new friendship agreement which was agreed in Thessaloniki in June starts during our EU Presidency and will continue for some years. Recently I said it would go on for the decade but it will continue for some years and concerns the discussions which will open with the Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, totalitarian states. It will discuss what is happening in the territories to the south, Algeria, Libya and Israel. It concerns where this will end and how we keep control. I have big concerns which I have voiced in discussions and will voice again during our EU Presidency. The process is starting and it is a matter of how we keep control and regulate it. It is not something for the Irish EU Presidency now but it has started and will remain a big issue over the next decade, particularly for a small country.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following specific and important matter, namely, the necessity for the Government to address the serious underfunding of local government which has resulted in local authorities imposing substantial levies on already stressed first-time home buyers while doing nothing to address the serious problem that exists in the State regarding inflated land prices as a result of decades of unhindered land speculation. These levies will cause a further escalation in house prices across the State and force ever increasing numbers of young people away from the house market and on to the social housing waiting lists, while increasing the hardship for those young couples who are already hit by the removal of the first-time buyer's grant in the last budget.

I presume we will support it but, in future, I ask that more time be given prior to a date being set. They already know when they are going – their bags are packed – and we are discussing it. This seems to be a rubber stamp.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Two weeks ago I raised with the Taoiseach the matter of a statement to be made to the House by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of the Nally report commissioned following the Omagh bombing. At that stage the Taoiseach indicated that there were still some outstanding legal difficulties—
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	211	It will not make the slightest bit of difference.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	212	—on sensitive matters. I am led to believe that the evidence given to the Government by the Northern Ireland Ombudsman is of a serious import and, in respect of the families of the victims of that atrocity and finding out the truth, perhaps the Taoiseach might indicate whether the outstanding legal problems have been resolved somewhat and when he might expect the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be able to publish an edited version of the report and make a statement to the House.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	213	The Minister is anxious to do that but he cannot do it until the legal matters are resolved.

It obviously requires much more time given that there is a diversity of views, within Government as well as everywhere else.On the Garda Síochána Bill, yesterday we extended the Freedom of Information Act to cover a number of prescribed bodies. Will the Garda Síochána Bill, due in this session, be published soon so we can debate how much information the Garda Síochána is allowed to divulge?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I answered this question yesterday but I will do so again. A large number of people across a range of Departments and agencies are working to try to complete this Bill. They have worked weekends and have put in a huge effort, both in consultation with the groups and in trying to complete the legislation. It is not an easy Bill, but they are endeavouring to complete it. They hope to do so this month, but I want to get it right. We will try to publish it as soon as possible.It is quite a complex Bill involving a large number of individuals and concerns more than one Department. The frameworks cover many different issues in environment, employment equality and health. Those involved are endeavouring to complete the legislation as quickly as possible.

Second Stage of the Residential Tenancies Bill, which took the Government three years to prepare, began late one night before the summer recess and resumed for a short time after the summer. It has appeared a number of weeks as back-up and has not appeared this week. Is the Government still proceeding with that Bill? If so, when will the remainder of Second Stage be taken in the House?The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be required to bring regulations before the Dáil between now and the local elections arising from the Electoral Act and the Local Government Act, to provide for a date for the local elections, the hours of polling and various matters relating to the conduct of those elections. I understand that the same Minister has been appointed to take charge of the Fianna Fáil campaign for the same elections. Is the Taoiseach serious that the rules of the next local elections will be written by the person who has been given charge of the Fianna Fáil campaign for the same elections? Would that be tolerated in another democracy?

There has been a long-standing promise that the health and safety Act would be amended to provide better safety regulations for vulnerable people on building sites and in places of employment. Will there be two separate items of legislation or is it envisaged that the ability to provide for anti-smoking regulations will be incorporated in the original health and safety legislation that was promulgated in this House? If such incorporation takes place, will it delay the amendment of the Health and Safety Act?

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves the despatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, as amended by the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993, of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL, established on 19 September 2003 under UN Security Council Resolution 1509 (2003).In commending this motion to the House, I wish to outline the background to the United Nations Mission in Liberia and the reason the Government decided to respond positively to the invitation from the United Nations to provide a contingent.Liberia has been in a state of almost constant conflict since the late 1980s. With its neighbouring countries of the Mano River Union, Sierra Leone and Guinea, it has been at the centre of interrelated conflicts, driven principally by the sponsorship of rebel movements by national leaders seeking to undermine their neighbouring regimes. Liberia's former President, Charles Taylor, was the principal architect in fomenting instability in the region, particularly through his support for the rebel movement in Sierra Leone, the Revolutionary United Front, RUF. In turn, Sierra Leone and Côte d'Ivoire, have been accused of supporting and sponsoring anti-Taylor rebels in Liberia.The conflict in the region has been marked by large-scale human rights abuses, including intimidation, rape, decapitation and murder. Within Liberia, the Taylor regime was marked by human rights abuses, corruption and rampant exploitation of natural resources for private gain. Two major rebel groups emerged within Liberia in opposition to Taylor, namely, Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, LURD, with an estimated strength of 5,000, and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia, MODEL, comprising 1,500 to 3,000 personnel. Both groups have histories of atrocities towards civilian populations and have relied on child soldiers, including girls. It is estimated that Liberia has 27,000 to 38,000 combatants, including the Taylorites, up to 70% of whom are minors.The initial impetus for change was the provision of adequate resources and a robust mandate to the peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL. However, while the situation in Sierra Leone improved, Liberia was still in a state of civil war, notwithstanding the imposition of carefully targeted sanctions by the UN on the Taylor regime. On 29 July 2003, UN Secretary General Annan wrote to the President of the Security Council to propose a three-phase deployment of international troops to Liberia, to be authorised under Security Council resolutions. The Secretary General also demonstrated his resolve to secure peace in Liberia by appointing as his special representative to Liberia an experienced UN official, Jacques-Paul Klein, a US national.On 4 August 2003, a Nigerian-led mission was deployed, bolstered by troops from a number of west African nations, with support from UNAMSIL and the US. Since then, President Taylor accepted the offer of exile in Nigeria and a comprehensive peace agreement was signed by the government and the rebel groups on 18 August 2003. The peace agreement, which sets out a "road map" towards elections in 2005, has been endorsed by the Security Council in Resolution 1509, which also established UNMIL. In accordance with the terms of the peace agreement, the National Transitional Government of Liberia was inaugurated in Monrovia on 14 October 2003, headed by Mr. Gyude Bryant, who serves as chairman of the transitional government.The stated objective of LURD and MODEL rebel groups has been the removal of Taylor as president. As that objective has been achieved, both groups are involved in the transitional government and are parties to the comprehensive peace agreement. Publicly, both groups are committed to the democratic process and to disarmament, dissolution and destruction of weapons. However, despite recent improvements in the security situation in UN-controlled areas and progress in the implementation of the agreement, Liberia remains highly unstable and the peace process remains fragile. The rebel movements continue to control large areas outside of the capital, Monrovia. Minor incidents can quickly escalate and there is poor control and communication between the disparate elements of the rebel groups. As Members will be aware, there have been incidents involving the rebel groups and government forces in Monrovia and, more recently, in the north of the country since the national transitional government was established.Establishing peace in Liberia, in tandem with the current UN operations in support of peace in Sierra Leone and the wider Mano River Union region, offers a real and tangible opportunity for the international community to assist in bringing stability to the region as a whole. The Defence Forces have a strong tradition of participation in missions of this nature and Ireland has a particular commitment to Africa, evidenced by, among other things, our bilateral aid programme. Ireland is firmly committed to the role of the UN in the maintenance of international peace and security. The Government considers that Ireland, as a long-standing contributor to UN peacekeeping, should participate, where possible, in suitable peace support operations. The UNMIL operation in Liberia offers a suitable opportunity for such participation.UNMIL has a strong and robust UN mandate. Security Council Resolution 1509 established a peacekeeping operation consisting of up to 15,000 military personnel, together with up to 250 military observers, 1,115 civilian police officers and a civilian component, for 12 months. UNMIL will operate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which means that the force will have authorisation to take all necessary measures to fulfil its mandate.UNMIL's mandate is comprehensive and includes monitoring the implementation of the ceasefire and the comprehensive peace agreement between the government and rebel forces. It also includes, inter alia, assisting the disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration, and repatriation of all armed parties, providing security and protection, the provision of humanitarian assistance and the promotion of human rights. UNMIL will have an initial strength of 3,500 personnel drawn from more than 20 countries. While Ireland is so far the only western country offering formed military units, a number of our EU partners are providing staff officers and military observers. The Netherlands is also supplying key medical facilities for the mission and I would like to express my appreciation for this.The proposed Irish contingent will comprise a motorised infantry battalion of 430 personnel and a small number of additional personnel who will be deployed at force headquarters and as military observers. At the request of the UN, a contingent of the Army ranger wing will be deployed for three months. The Irish contingent will operate as the force commander's rapid reaction reserve. The role of the Irish personnel will be the provision of an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force to provide a swift and decisive military reaction to a crisis situation. In the initial stages, the Irish battalion will act in a pathfinding role for the UN brigades deploying beyond Monrovia.Subject to Dáil approval, deployment to UNMIL will take place in November-December 2003. Initial deployment will be for one year, with a possible extension thereafter, subject to renewal of the UN mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission. In the case of UNMIL, my intention is that Defence Forces involvement will not exceed two to three years. Elections, which are due in 2005 under the comprehensive peace agreement, should be completed at that stage.A detailed reconnaissance and threat assessment has been undertaken in the mission area by a Defence Forces team. The military authorities have reported that Liberia is an inherently dangerous theatre of operations. The potential for renewed hostilities, an unquantified mine or improvised explosive device threat, hazardous driving conditions, the demanding climatic conditions and the threat to health make force protection a primary concern for the Defence Forces.In the current phase of the UN operation, UNMIL troops have only been deployed in and around Monrovia. The security threat to UNMIL troops in Monrovia is assessed as medium due to the potential for minor incidents to escalate quickly into major confrontations. The poor communications between the leaders of the various factions and their troops also has the potential to lead to sporadic fighting. All sides are generally abiding by the UN imposed weapons ban in the city and are awaiting the full deployment of UNMIL. The security threat to UNMIL troops in the rest of Liberia is assessed as high. However, it is anticipated that this threat should decline as the UN peacekeeping troops are deployed beyond Monrovia in the next phase of deployment.The health risk is assessed as high. Disease rates in Liberia are among the highest in the world, exacerbated by huge numbers of displaced persons crowded into Monrovia. Malaria is the major insect-borne disease and transmission is sustained year round. Other diseases include hepatitis A, E and B, sleeping sickness and a variety of viral and food and water-borne diseases. HIV-AIDS is also prevalent.The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern. While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions, it is the policy and practice to ensure Defence Forces personnel are adequately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training and this will also apply in the case of the contingent to be deployed for service with UNMIL. The contingent will be supplemented by a number of additional engineers to counter the threat from unexploded ordnance, mines and improvised explosive devices. Additional medical personnel will be deployed because of the particularly hazardous nature of the health environment. Additional heavy weaponry will also be deployed in a force protection role.The Defence Forces adopt a comprehensive approach to managing and protecting the health of deployed personnel. As a matter of course, all personnel volunteering must have passed their annual medical in the first instance. They are then subjected to a further detailed overseas medical under which they are assessed for suitability with particular reference to the physical requirements of the mission. The troops to be deployed to Liberia will all go through this process.The main risk to health in Liberia is malaria. In this regard, the director of the Army medical corps has stated that systematic use by Defence Forces personnel of anti-malaria medication should be effective in protecting them from this disease. Troops are being fully immunised against all other known disease risks including yellow fever, hepatitis A and B, cholera, meningitis and tetanus. With regard to water-borne parasites or diseases, the Defence Forces are bringing their own water purification and sewage treatment plants with them. On return from the mission, all troops will be tested as a matter of course.With regard to on the ground medical facilities, the Defence Forces will deploy, as part of the battalion, a state-of-the-art containerised medical facility, which was recently acquired. The medical facility will be operated by two medical doctors who will be assisted by a team of 13 Defence Forces medical personnel and paramedics. Special training is being provided by the Netherlands to our medical personnel on the environmental health issues arising in a tropical setting. A full surgical medical facility is being provided to the mission by the Netherlands initially and by Jordan thereafter. In addition, there is a Red Cross medical facility in Monrovia and a full surgical medical facility in Freetown, attached to the UNAMSIL, which is also provided by Jordan. The Jordanians provided a similar facility to our troops in UNMEE, which worked well there.It is estimated that the additional ongoing cost to the Defence Vote – transportation, living costs, overseas allowances – from participation in UNMIL will amount to €12.1 million per annum. UN reimbursement of costs to the Exchequer in this regard should amount to €10.8 million per annum, leaving a net additional cost to the Exchequer of €1.3 million in 2004.Ireland has always taken seriously its obligation under the United Nations Charter to make available to the Security Council armed forces, assistance and facilities to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. In Liberia, Ireland has the opportunity to contribute in a substantive manner in bringing stability to a key region in Africa and to support the establishment of peace, respect for human rights and the rule of law and the re-establishment of civil society in the region. Since our first involvement in peacekeeping in 1958, Ireland's willingness to participate in UN peace support missions has been motivated by a firm belief that peoples throughout the world have the right to live in peace with justice, free from fear. Our participation in UNMIL represents a continuation and vindication of that belief.In commending this motion to the House, I hope to have the support of my colleagues opposite. Over the years, we have had practically unanimous support in this House for missions of this kind. I look forward to the continuation of that support and would welcome the views of Members.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate. At the outset, I have two questions which I ask the Minister to address in his response. He said that at the request of the UN, a contingent of the Army ranger wing will be deployed for three months. Will he inform the House of the number of personnel in that contingent, what their duties will be and why they, specifically, were requested? I understand that a Naval Service vessel was sent to reconnoitre and I do not know whether it is still off the coast of Liberia. I ask the Minister, when replying, to indicate if it is intended that the Naval Service vessel will remain in that area.Liberia, a country rich in natural resources and bordered by Guinea, Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast, has suffered greatly from civil war and extreme violence. During 14 years of almost continuous warfare, where even children have been turned into soldiers, tens of thousands have lost their homes, their families and their lives. In 2001, the UN imposed sanctions on Liberia, as well as an arms embargo and a travel ban on Government officials, because of Liberia's support of the rebel insurgency in Sierra Leone. More recently, last May, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, blamed Liberia and, in particular, President Charles Taylor for the conflicts and refugee crises in West Africa. Mr. Lubbers said, in unusually blunt terms, that Mr. Taylor should be forced out. He also urged the US to act on what he said was its responsibility toward Liberia, a timber-rich country and the leading African iron-ore producer, founded by freed American slaves in the 19th century.In August, a peace agreement was signed between the Government of Liberia, the political parties and the rebel groups and in mid-October businessman Gyude Bryant took office as leader of Liberia's interim post-war Government. He is faced with the daunting task of guiding the devastated country into peace after 14 years of bloodletting by the ousted warlord and President. Mr. Bryant took an oath as chairman, not president, of the transitional power-share Government, pledging to take Liberia from "a state of disrepair".It is easy to see why Liberia exists in such a state of disrepair and despair. After 14 years of near constant violence, 85% of the population of Liberia lives below the poverty line. An estimated 450,000 people have been displaced by the conflict and live in appalling conditions. Humanitarian and relief efforts face real difficulties on the ground as the security situation remains volatile and continues to hamper relief efforts. From all this, it is clear that Liberia needs our assistance. It is right and proper that Ireland, a nation with a proud history in international peacekeeping missions, should answer the call to help. Accordingly, I support the motion to approve the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to play a part in this important peacekeeping work in Liberia.The motion we are discussing today is in accordance with international law. The United Nations established the mission in Liberia, UNMIL, under UN Security Council Resolution 1509 of 2003. It is hoped that the first Irish troops will commence deployment soon, as the Minister has said, and that the UN request will be fully met by Ireland by mid-December. Accordingly, the role which our Defence Forces are about to take on, with the approval of this House, is an important and imminent one. The Minister stated that 430 members of the Permanent Defence Force will take part in this mission and will soon travel to Liberia. This is possibly one of the most challenging missions ever undertaken by the Irish Defence Forces. Our thoughts and prayers should be with them and their families at this time and in future.At times such as this, we must remind ourselves of the bravery and selflessness of our Defence Forces. The members of this latest contingent are following in a long and proud tradition. Ireland's history of service under the flag of the United Nations must be a source of considerable pride to the Irish people. Since 1958, the Defence Forces have had a continuous presence on United Nations peacekeeping missions, mainly in the Middle East. However, in recent years, Irish Defence Forces personnel have also found themselves in many other parts of the globe as peacekeepers. Defence Forces personnel have served as observers in Central America, Russia, former Yugoslavia, Cambodia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Namibia, Western Sahara, South Africa and East Timor.This clearly displays the Irish commitment to important peacekeeping work, a commitment that was strengthened in 1993 when the then Government restated the roles of the Defence Forces and defined one of them as being: "To participate in United Nations missions in the cause of international peace."  This was further affirmed in the 1996 Government White Paper on foreign policy which stated: "Given the unique role and authority of the United Nations and the fact that its peacekeeping activities have proved an important element in containing conflict, the Government is committed to sustaining the overall level of Ireland's contribution to peacekeeping."  However, this contribution has had a high cost. In the cause of peace, 82 members of the Defence Forces have given their lives.Under section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 1960 Dáil Éireann must approve this motion before any contingent of the Defence Forces is deployed for service. Section 2 provides for the deployment of a contingent of the Defence Forces for service outside the State if "a resolution has been passed by Dáil Éireann, approving of the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State as part of that international United Nations Force."  However, this is not the only matter which must be addressed before a contingent of the Defence Forces can engage in a peacekeeping mission. The participation of the Defence Forces is subject to what is commonly known as the triple lock which, in effect, places an excessive restriction on Defence Forces participation in peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions.For example, although the Government has committed 850 troops to the EU rapid reaction force – an EU capability designed to undertake humanitarian and crisis management tasks – these forces will only be deployed under this triple lock system. For Ireland, this means that any potential military action must be endorsed by a full United Nations mandate establishing or authorising such an international UN force, approved by Dáil Éireann and agreed by the Government. On the face of it, this seems reasonable. However, by applying such a restrictive code to the involvement of Irish forces, even in European operations, the Government has ruled out Irish participation in some peacekeeping activities. For example, Ireland could not participate in the EU peacekeeping force, Operation Concordia, which was sent earlier this year to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a probable future member of the EU, even though this force replaced NATO and had both EU and UN support, set out in Resolution 1371. It now seems likely that EU troops will also replace NATO in Bosnia-Herzegovina.The difficulty in getting a UN resolution establishing or authorising an international UN force can relate to the self-interests of members of the Security Council, which is made up of five permanent members and ten rotating members. It normally takes nine Security Council members to carry a resolution so long as none of the permanent members – the US, Russia, China, the UK and France – votes against it. However, in the case of Macedonia, such a resolution was not carried because it did not suit the interests of China. UNPREDEP, the UN Preventive Deployment Force in Macedonia, was to be extended but that had to be withdrawn. Macedonia had recognised Taiwan so China retaliated by blocking the UN peacekeeping force resolution. Therefore, by having a triple lock we have given self-serving members of the UN Security Council, who may be operating to a narrow national agenda, the right to pre-empt our free decision. Obviously, this is neither healthy nor wise.Under the triple lock we abdicate our freedom to decide for ourselves, leaving it in the hands of the five permanent members of UN Security Council. There should be no barrier to Ireland acting as an independent, sovereign State. It is absurd that our sovereign decision can be manipulated by a world power, as happened in the case of Macedonia.To end this anomaly, Deputy McGinley and I recently published a Private Members' Bill, the International Peace Missions Bill 2003. This Bill seeks to end the triple lock and to amend the Defence Acts to allow Ireland to send troops to participate in peace missions, even when those missions are not set up as an international UN force. However, the Bill specifically requires that any deployment be in accord with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.Looking specifically at the wording of the UN Charter, Chapter VIII, Article 52 states: "Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action provided that such arrangements or agencies and their activities are consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations."  Section 3 of our Bill allows for the deployment of Irish troops as part of an international peace mission if a resolution has been passed by the Dáil and the Dáil is satisfied that the mission is in keeping with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. In other words, in peacekeeping and enforcement we should decide for ourselves what does and does not meet the UN charter requirements and we should not be vetoed on this specific issue in future by members of the Security Council acting selfishly.Under the current triple lock system, Irish participation in peacekeeping missions can continue to be vetoed in this way. This must be totally unacceptable for an independent, sovereign State such as ours which seeks to use its influence to promote peace throughout the world. Dáil Éireann is the proper authority in constitutional law permitted to decide on the deployment of our troops in lawful peacekeeping or peace enforcement activities. In the case of Macedonia the Dáil was sidelined by another state acting selfishly, but 13 other EU states and 14 non-EU states participated and were not sidelined in this manner. We could not act and it is appalling that we can vote to send our troops to dangerous places like Liberia and not to relatively safe places like Macedonia because of the Chinese veto. There are Members in the House who support that.

That relative expressed serious concerns about the health aspects of this mission and, though the Minister outlined some health measures, they will not be enough to assuage the concerns of the personnel and their families. The Minister has a duty to provide primary and emergency medical treatment for those who will serve in Liberia and, as he said, it is a war-ravaged and medically hazardous country.Currently only five Army doctors are eligible for mandatory selection for service in Liberia. As this is a UN Chapter VII peace enforcement mission, not a peacekeeping mission, and 14 of the 19 doctors currently serving in the Army enlisted before 1994, it is not mandatory for those doctors to go on this mission. They will have to volunteer their services but they may be reluctant to do so for a number of reasons. According to an article in The Sunday Tribune last week, Liberia ranks 174th of the 175 most disease-ridden countries in the world. This is our most dangerous mission since the Congo in 1960.The Minister said yesterday in Tralee: "We would be out there for three to four years."  This means each of these doctors would have to serve on a number of missions in Liberia over the next four years, as each mission lasts six months. How sustainable is that? The shortage of doctors in the Defence Forces is critical and the situation is deteriorating as there has been no recruitment for the past two years. What urgent steps, if any, will the Minister take to recruit doctors to the Defence Forces, given the abject failure to do so in recent years?My questions are simple. Is the Minister satisfied that our medical support is adequate? How sustainable is that support on this mission? What steps is he taking to recruit more doctors for the Defence Forces, given the failure in recent years to do so?

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to the men and women of the Defence Forces who have given such loyal and dedicated service to the United Nations in trouble spots all over the world and who daily put their safety and lives at risk in the cause of peace. The locations where Irish troops are serving read like a list of the trouble spots of the world. Some are places where trouble has erupted in recent years, such as Kosovo and East Timor, while others are places with long-running and still unresolved disputes, such as Cyprus and the Middle East. There are yet others where the problems may have slipped from the front page, such as Ethiopia or the Congo, but where the presence of UN observers is crucial to the maintenance of peace.It is 40 years since Irish troops first went abroad to serve with the UN and, for a small country, we have made an enormous contribution in this regard. Almost 10% of our personnel are serving abroad and we are the sixth largest provider of troops to UN peace missions. In the course of four decades Ireland has paid a high price in the commitment of both financial resources and personnel to the pursuit of world peace, but this pales into insignificance compared to the price paid by Defence Forces personnel who have been killed or injured in the course of these operations.Our troops bound for Liberia will find themselves in a particularly difficult situation, caught between conflicting sides as the country attempts to emerge from years of civil war and the recent reign of President Charles Taylor. While efforts by the international community to forge a lasting peace and create an interim government for Liberia are in their infancy, the country remains war-torn and ravaged by disease.Taking power on the back of public fears that his failure to win would lead to further war, Charles Taylor's period in power from 1997 to last August saw schools, hospitals, roads and vital infrastructure remain derelict. Moreover, ongoing warmongering by Charles Taylor with neighbouring Sierra Leone saw him indicted for bearing the greatest responsibility for a series of atrocities in Sierra Leone since 1996.This is the political context for the sending of 430 Irish peacekeeping troops on this mission. Operating under UN Security Council Resolution 1509, the forces will serve as part of the United Nations mission in Liberia mandated to maintain the current ceasefire between warring factions in Liberia and to keep law and order throughout the country. Needless to say, Liberia is a high humanitarian disaster zone. Only this week, the Irish army officers' association, RACO, expressed severe concern about the level of medical back-up available to forces in Liberia. Any post-war society will be short of vital medical supplies, however the risk of contracting malaria is so severe in this part of Africa that we are right to ask the Minister for Defence if he can assure us of the steps being taken to ensure Irish soldiers have access to medical care.Meanwhile, so dangerous is the situation in Liberia generally that PDFORRA has counselled the Government to make risk assessment a priority when participating in overseas peacekeeping missions such as this one. While a new transitional Government is in place, Irish forces are charged with enforcing peace between numerous militia groups using child soldiers with access to large amounts of weaponry.Irish troops will be part of the UN's Rapid Reaction Force and, as such, will be charged with supporting any other peacekeeping troops who encounter trouble. The level of risk involved in this operation is one of the highest facing any Irish peacekeeping mission. Given these concerns, and especially since the United Nations mission in Liberia will see the largest deployment of Irish troops since the mission to Lebanon, it is incumbent on the Minister for Defence to provide political and moral support for our forces with the United Nations. However, he must also ensure that when Irish troops serve abroad on peacekeeping operations they have the equipment and training necessary to guarantee the maximum possible level of safety and security.I know that training is not a problem as Irish troops have always been well prepared for operations abroad, and this is acknowledged in the respect with which they are held by other contingents with which they have served. However, a number of important issues with regard to the Defence Forces remain unresolved and it is important that on a day when we are discussing the deployment of Irish troops elsewhere, we receive assurances from the Minister for Defence that other matters will also be addressed.While we will send more than 400 troops to Liberia, the Defence Forces continue to suffer from cutbacks in Government expenditure. The Minister for Finance has not spared any section of the Defence Forces in his determination to cut public spending. This affects the level of applications from potential recruits as the Minister for Defence last week confirmed to me that hundreds of jobs in the forces are to go over the next three years. Therefore, while we are sending out troops to Africa to participate in peacekeeping operations, which are a fundamental part of Irish foreign policy, at home the Government is actively cutting numbers and diluting the country's ability to play a prominent role in international security.I would also like the Minister to assure us that sufficient volunteers have been obtained to meet the necessary requirements for this mission. One Sunday newspaper reported recently that 380 of the necessary 430 personnel had been found. When will the final 50 personnel be in place?Another issue that arises in regard to our participation in peacekeeping operations is that substantial amounts of money are still due to this country from the UN. Ireland is owed huge amounts by the United Nations for providing Irish personnel to UN peacekeeping missions abroad. This debt arises from our participation in Lebanon and Cyprus because we are responsible for our own expenses in other cases. The financial problems of the United Nations arise from the failure of a number of member states, particularly the United States, to discharge their debts to the organisation. Despite its shortcomings, the United Nations has played a most valuable role in limiting conflict throughout the world. It is wrong that some countries, which are happy to use the United Nations when its suits their own political agendas, at the same time should restrict the potential of the organisation by refusing to pay their way.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this mission and I join others in wishing our troops a healthy and safe experience in Liberia and, most importantly, a safe return. There are many other extraneous issues in the context of this decision which I cannot deal with in the time available, but I will deal with them on another occasion. For example, Deputy Gay Mitchell will know that I disagree with him on the structure of the debate he seeks. We should be debating reform of the United Nations, including reform of the Security Council. That is a more urgent debate than seeking to unwind the triple lock mechanism, although I agree that is a debate on which we should hear Members' views.It is interesting that the United Nations motion covering the sending of our troops comes under a Chapter VII resolution. It is important we note the significance of that because it gives the clearest possible authority in international law to our troops. It also increases to some extent the danger they face in so far as a Chapter VII resolution facilitates the maximum amount of intervention which can result in the maximum amount of risk.I want to put a few points to the Minister. This is one of the most dangerous missions on which Irish troops have been sent for a long time. My experience of meeting people who have served on missions and my admiration for them is such that on the deployment of troops in North Africa and particularly in Central America I remember that great importance was attached to the experience they had accumulated and the wisdom some of the older people had gained. That is to some extent sacrificed by the retirement from the force of many people who would have had the experience of service on previous missions. Many of the people who will go on this mission will be younger people who will have an advantage in a physical sense but who will be at a disadvantage to some extent in terms of experience of dealing with complex issues where there are competing elements. That is an important part of a mission.The Minister addressed some of the facilities that will be available to troops who travel. I am somewhat worried about this. Two senior members of the Department of Defence made a presentation at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. The appendix to their presentation showed that the equipment available to the Army was far more suitable for a European theatre of peace enforcement than for the classical tasks of peace establishment in Africa or in a country other than one in the European theatre. I could give practical examples but the time available does not allow for that. For example, the list of equipment the Army was seeking included equipment for dealing with the consequences of chemical warfare and so forth. That is not the circumstances in which the troops in Liberia will find themselves. They will be particularly tested in terms of the quality of vehicles available to them, on which I raise a question. People will have to bear with me on this, and I would be delighted to be proved wrong. There is some slight confusion but I understand the troops will be deployed outside of Monrovia. Taking account of the terrain there, modern vehicles will be required.On the medical support system, tropical medicine is a specialism. That is the case even here for those who have spent short periods in the tropics. Extraordinary care has to be taken in regard to the life experience of young soldiers, male and female. There was reference to the infrastructural and physical conditions in Liberia. There are exaggerated problems, particularly in such matters as water quality. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, in his speech referred to mobile facilities, including water purification and sewage treatment, and other medical facilities which can be transported there. However, the technology of these facilities needs to be tested in advance in terms of adequacy.There was a suggestion that paramedics can be quickly trained to deal with particular tropical illnesses. What does this tell us? It tells us of a singularly silly attitude for any Minister for Defence, not just the present one.We must look at how those who served abroad and those who will do so are excluded from giving their opinions on operational matters in missions such as this. I find this extraordinary and unacceptable. It is important that their views should be taken into account.I am concerned that people present states such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and Côte d'Ivoire as places that are inherently prone to conflict. We must remember that the conflict in Liberia was run by external forces. Liberian natural resources could not have been sold unless people were willing to purchase them. Charles Taylor was sponsored by surrogate forces early on in his career. The problem is not Liberian in source, but that other people ran the degradation of Liberia. It is equally true that western states are selling the new lightweight weapons that enable ever younger children to carry them. This is a contributory factor to the increase in the number of child soldiers. Internationally, the figure for child soldiers now runs to approximately 250,000. We should point our finger at those who exploit the technology of lightweight materiel to drag children into the conflict.Given the complex six elements in the mandate for the Defence Forces, what support do they have for dealing with social, political and integrationist aspects of the mission? This mission has the capacity to last for several years. I have said all this with the sense of best wishes and concern for the troops who will serve there. However, it would be dishonest not to say that I am unconvinced about the arguments put forward by the Department of Defence on interoperability, by which I mean that for which it has classically not prepared. I am not convinced about the quality of the infrastructure preparations. This is the time to begin involving those who will serve in detailed discussions, including those on operational matters. It is in our, their and their families' interests.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	310	There are few occasions in this House when we are faced with a life and death decision. This is one such occasion. A decision to dispatch Irish troops is subject to the triple lock of Dáil, Government and UN sanction. The Liberian mission has been approved by the UN and the Government. It is now up to the Dáil to give its approval. We in the Green Party will give this approval in the full knowledge that this mission is dangerous. We are equally confident that our troops are well-trained and will, as always, do a superb job.In the past, our men and women in uniform have performed courageously on UN peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions. Many have paid the ultimate price. It is with this in mind that we have made our decision. On behalf of the Green Party, I express our unstinting admiration for our soldiers. We will do everything to ensure, not only their safety, but that they enjoy the best possible conditions in Liberia.The Minister for Defence is aware that PDFORRA and RACO have expressed concerns about the safety of Irish troops in Liberia and the terrible dilemmas they will face there, not least encounters with child soldiers, many of whom are out of their minds on drugs and carry the lightweight weapons Deputy Michael Higgins referred to. We must also ensure we have adequate medical back-up for our troops.This is a Chapter VII mission but what precisely are the rules of engagement? The most effective role Irish troops can play in ensuring and promoting international security is as UN peacekeepers. For this reason, the Green Party was not happy about the expansion of the Defence Forces' role into so-called peace enforcement or Chapter VII missions. This was an expansion that resulted from the amendment of the defence Acts by Fianna Fáil Administrations in the early 1990s. Ireland is a small country with an enormous international reputation for excellence in peacekeeping on behalf of the UN. This requires a certain type of specialist training, equipment and ethos. To expect the Army to switch over to more robust missions, as successive Governments have tried to do via joining NATO's PfP and the EU Rapid Reaction Force, is not an easy task and not one we welcome. We would have preferred that Irish troops continued in their role solely as peacekeepers in the service of the UN.There has been a downgrading of the Defence Forces' involvement in UN mandated missions by the last and present Governments since their withdrawal from the Lebanon. I hope this represents a change in this policy.I find it extraordinary that Deputy Gay Mitchell expressed—

As public representatives, we cannot take this duty of ours lightly and we cannot gloss over the implications of such a motion. In September I welcomed the establishment of the UN peacekeeping mission in Liberia, which at full strength will have a deployment of 15,000 military personnel and more than 1,000 civilian police officers. I understand its role is to monitor compliance with the Accra peace accord, which was signed in August by the Liberian Government, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia and the Liberian Union for Reconciliation and Democracy. It also has responsibility to support the Liberian peace process, which has the potential to end more than 15 years of continuous conflict in Liberia. I hope it will contribute to the stabilisation of the region.In Liberia our Defence Forces will be serving as UN troops with colleagues from Nigeria, Kenya and Bangladesh, all under the West African command. In the short time since UNMIL was deployed on 1 August, good progress has been made. A national transitional Government has already been established. The disarmament process has begun and I understand the capital, Monrovia, is now a weapons-free zone. This initial progress is to be welcomed and I hope it will continue apace.In keeping with Sinn Féin's commitment to positive neutrality and action, we support this motion and Irish participation in the UN force, UNMIL. We take this position having regard to the available facts and to the potential dangers to those who will make up the Irish contingent. On behalf of my party, I express our appreciation to the men and women who will represent Ireland by serving in Liberia. It is a worthwhile endeavour in which they have the full support of the Irish people. It is intended that the troops will depart for Monrovia on 19 November and I wish them success in their mission. I hope that all of them will return home safely to their families.What sets this peacekeeping mission apart from many others and what further commends it to our support is the fact that it is not merely UN mandated or authorised but UN led. Such a mission is increasingly rare and worthy of strong support in principle. We would prefer to see the UN reformed, strengthened and given the support it deserves so that the so-called outsourcing of peacekeeping operations to regional military alliances such as the EU Rapid Reaction Force or NATO will end. The UN was created to render such standing military alliances obsolete. We are committed to this vision and look forward to the day when all nations of the earth will make a genuine commitment to global and equal partnership of states.We must continue to heed the call of UN Secretary General and help lead the campaign for UN reform and building the capacity of that organisation. Such a campaign has been far too long in coming and as we have still not come to grips with it in this House, we urgently need to have a structured debate on it.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the major topic of sending Irish troops to Liberia. Before going into the details of this important mission, I commend all Irish troops who have given their lives for peace under the flag of the United Nations. Their bravery, courage and integrity will never be forgotten. We support their families in their loss and their sacrifice will always be remembered and honoured.This motion seeks approval to send 450 Irish troops to Liberia. This could be a very dangerous mission and lives could again be lost. However, this is a case where the greater good is served by the intervention of Irish troops. The United Nations needs our support and the people on the ground are crying out for our assistance. I have no problem with Irish troops under the United Nations acting as peacekeepers in war-torn areas. It is essential that those of us who oppose President Bush's war on Iraq show our support for the United Nations and above all allow our soldiers to bring peace and reconciliation to Liberia.When we send Irish troops on peacekeeping missions it is essential that we give them our total support and full back-up to preserve their personal safety. Conflict resolution in this case is extremely complex and dangerous. About 300,000 child soldiers throughout the world experience death, suffering and destruction at a very young age. In addition, some of them are on drugs and their record on atrocities is horrific. It will take a strong, decisive and able Irish contingent to deal with this dangerous and complex task. We need to face the reality that child soldiers with AK-47s in their hands and pumped up with drugs will represent a nightmare for our troops.While it will be a demanding environment, I have great confidence in our United Nations troops to do a fair and professional job. The bottom line is that if our soldiers are fired on and their peacekeeping is at risk they will have every right to defend themselves and protect the community in which they live. While this is just the downside of this debate, it is essential we are aware of the dangers and the reality on the ground in Liberia. It is necessary to plan for this and be prepared for the worst-case scenario, particularly after the years of death and violence in Liberia.I am confident that the people on the ground will respect our troops and the United Nations. Both inside and outside the Dáil I have always stressed the need for Ireland to have a strong independent foreign policy line so that we can retain the respect and support of the other nations of the world. Cosying up to NATO or to Mr. Blair or Mr. Bush is damaging to our ability to act as an independent honest broker on the international stage.The same theory and practice applies to the Middle East. Ireland has great potential to be a world leader in international peace and human rights and can play a role as an independent arbitrator where there is conflict. We should push these types of issues on the international peace agenda. Senator George Mitchell assisted us in our peace process and helped to get both the talks and agreement off the ground. There is no reason our country cannot carry out a similar mandate in places where there is conflict. The closest example is the Middle East. Ireland should take a more proactive role in assisting a peace settlement there.I strongly support the proposal to dispatch a contingent from the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations mission in Liberia. Even though I know this could last three or four years, I give my support as it is the right thing to do. It is about bringing peace and stability to a war-torn country. It is about trying to end the nightmare of child soldiers and save the childhood of future generations. Above all it is about bringing peace and justice to a country that needs our help and support. I commend the motion.
#MaeSextonPD	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-party	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-dob	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter, the participation of members of our Defence Forces in the peace-enforcement mission in Liberia. Ireland has a proud and historic tradition of contributing to UN missions since becoming a member in 1955. However, our role has not simply been confined to peacekeeping. We have also played a key role in areas of disarmament, development and human rights. To put this in perspective, out of the 56 United Nations peacekeeping missions in that time, Ireland has had an involvement in 13 countries.Our Defence Forces were involved in the peacekeeping mission in the Lebanon from 1978 to 2002 and we have forces currently committed to UN missions abroad, the largest of which is in Kosovo, where we have 261 serving members. Ireland is proportionally a large peacekeeping contributor within the international community and our commitment to such missions is a key element in our foreign policy. It is extremely important towards meeting our international obligations as a member of both the European Union and the United Nations.Of the 430 personnel assigned to the UN mission in Liberia, I am particularly proud that one-fifth of the entire complement of troops stationed in Longford's Connolly Barracks will be part of this deployment of volunteers. Coupled with the Defence Forces' commitment to other operations, this mission in Liberia brings Ireland's total of 800 troops to the highest level of participation in peace support operations since 2001.It is an undisputed fact that the success of peacekeeping missions primarily depends on the desires of the warring parties to resolve their differences peacefully. It equally depends on the support of international community, working in concert, with a clear mandate, and of course it is dependent on the provision of the resources necessary for the successful conclusion of the mandate objectives. Ireland's participation in overseas missions is underpinned by the confirmation in the Seville Declaration that this country's participation remains fully and firmly grounded in the UN as the international authority for co-operative arrangements for collective security. This decision-making process for involvement in the peace support operations requires that the conditions of the "triple-lock" mechanism be satisfied. This means that the operation must be authorised and mandated by the UN, it must be approved by Government, and the third "lock" is the approval of Dáil Éireann by way of resolution, which is the purpose of today's debate.The request by the UN for Irish Defence Forces' participation in Liberia follows lengthy delays in the implementation of the 1993 negotiated peace agreement, followed by the inability of the 1997-elected government to resolve the differences with the opposition parties over key issues of governance. Human rights violations, exclusion and harassment of opponents led to a resumption of hostilities, culminating in the resignation of President Charles Taylor and the establishment of the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL, under Security Council Resolution 1509 in September 2003.The role of UNMIL, working closely with the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, and neighbouring country UN missions is to facilitate the effective implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement, CPA, including a multi-dimensional operation composed of political, military, civilian police, criminal justice, civil affairs, human rights, gender, child protection, disarmament, demobilisation and re-integration. Peacekeepers are not just troops with guns, but are in situ to ensure that the structures of local government are put back in place.The Minister has clearly stated that the mission is "not without risk". All reports indicate that the situation on the ground is volatile and unstable. However, I have faith in those in the Defence Forces who have undertaken risk assessment and have advised the Minister accordingly.My conviction is that our Defence Forces are a professional army with a world-wide reputation for their ability to partake in peacekeeping missions anywhere in the world. I was sorely disappointed with Opposition suggestions to the contrary carried in the media in recent days. While such remarks might have been well intentioned, they have been perceived as insulting by members of the Defence Forces.My major concern is the child soldier issue. These young boys and girls, who are fully armed and have been force-fed on a cocktail of cocaine by senior officers, aggressively engage in conflict. This is a new departure for our Defence Forces, but I am confident that the military authorities, who are au fait with the clear rules of engagement in such circumstances, have provided the necessary training and support mechanisms for this new challenge.The widespread contamination of Liberia with a particularly virulent strain of malaria concerns not just me but every Member of the House. The Dutch have taken a "Level 3" ship to provide medical support to the force, but I again ask the Minister to assure the House that from an Irish viewpoint full medical support, including equipment and vaccination, is available to the troops. The Minister will forgive me if he mentioned it in his speech. I was at a committee meeting.I must stress the importance of showing the necessary political support to our Defence Forces. It is easy for Members of the House to concentrate for over two hours on a decision of this magnitude. However, political responsibility must follow such a decision. Our Defence Forces have served this country proudly at home and abroad and with distinction since the foundation of the State. We have often heard comments from soldiers about "our political masters", "armchair generals" etc. I would therefore hope that the so-called political masters will support this mission on a continual basis and that we will actively monitor the role of our Defence Forces in Liberia with regular statements in this House on the welfare of our troops, in line with our responsibility to them.Supporting our troops not only involves provision of the necessary equipment and means to carry out their task, it also means we look after their welfare. In this regard I have one final concern. As we can imagine, six months immersed in such a hostile environment can be demanding. It is 24-hour duty, seven days a week, a six-month mission with a mere two-week break. The last major force we deployed, in Lebanon, could readily avail of breaks in Israel, Cyprus or Egypt. However given the geographic location of Liberia such options are not available for rest and recreation for our troops. My information is that there is only one flight per week to Europe from Monrovia, costing on average in excess of €2,000. Given the rate of overseas allowances being paid to members of the Defence Forces, it would seem that a large portion of a soldier's allowance would be expended on a return trip to Ireland.Given the unique situation, I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to repatriation at no cost to soldiers wishing to avail of their leave in Ireland. I am aware that members of the Defence Forces currently deployed on 12-month missions are facilitated in this manner. I am not proposing a change in policy, merely a once-off concession as regards this particular mission.As a Deputy representing a garrison town, I am acutely aware not only of the commitment made by our troops, but the huge support from wives, families, children and parents. I know huge strides have been made within the Defence Forces in the last few years to ensure information is made available to the families. I again ask the Minister to ensure that such basic facilities as post and telephone access are frequently and readily available.I pay tribute to the wonderful men and women of our Defence Forces and their bravery and courage in volunteering for this mission in Liberia in the full knowledge of the risks involved. We will be forever proud of the part they are to play in assisting this war-ravaged country and its neighbour countries to achieve stability and remove the fear of further deaths. The death toll at present is 150,000, mostly civilians.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Like other speakers I pay tribute to the tremendous work undertaken by the Defence Forces in various peace missions throughout the world over the last 30 years or more. Irish soldiers have gone abroad to various trouble spots and put their lives at risk. Many of them have lost their lives. They have shown by their courage, dedication and discipline that they were second to none and capable of performing a service that others would try to emulate, by virtue of the fair and even-handed manner in which they carried out their duties. They did us proud and will continue to do so.I hope the Defence Forces will have the necessary backup required for this mission, which is so much more dangerous than many of those undertaken previously. I note the existence of a "vessel at sea" in the general area. On this mission the Defence Forces will require a type of service that was not necessary in previous locations.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 94 together.The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 fully commenced on 5 July 2002. It established the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, on a statutory basis as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance.The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. It has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate services and educational welfare services, together with a further eight head office staff. A total of 37 former school attendance officers who were employed under the previous legislation were transferred to the board in July 2002, in accordance with section 40 of the Act. To date, 27 of these have accepted in full the terms and conditions of the new grade of educational welfare officer. The remaining school attendance officers continue to carry out the duties which they performed under the previous legislation.An additional cohort of 36 service delivery staff was also sanctioned for the board in May of this year. A total of 31 new staff have now been appointed and the remaining positions will be filled by the end of November. This additional cohort will bring the total number of staff in the board to 84 by the end of 2003.The new services are being phased in and my Department has allocated a budget of €5.4 million to the board for 2003 for this purpose. Five regional teams are being established in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff are being deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme. A service will also be provided in all cases where children have been permanently excluded from education.As provided for under section 10 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, I have instructed officials of my Department to work with the board to ensure that any opportunities for integrated working between educational welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element are exploited to the maximum. I consider the implementation of protocols for such integrated working on attendance matters between the NEWB and, in particular, the home-school-community liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the visiting teacher service for Travellers, to be most important. When in place, these will assist the NEWB in carrying out its remit and ensure that all available existing resources are utilised to the optimum.The provision for the NEWB in 2004 will be made known tomorrow when the Abridged Estimates volume is published. The provision has been determined in light of developments to date, the overall resources available and the need to ensure a collaborative and co-operative approach by all involved in addressing issues of disadvantage.

While it is technically correct to say that it commenced in July 2002, does the Minister agree that progress to date is disappointing? The Educational Welfare Board has a statutory responsibility to respond in a wide variety of situations. Does the Minister agree that the board is not in a position to respond and carry out its statutory duty because of a lack of resources?The board has a role in carrying out reviews of training and guidance given to teachers. Is the Minister satisfied that the board is in a position to implement this function? The board also has a role in advising the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment about aspects of curriculum that, in its opinion, are likely to affect attendance levels. Does the Minister know whether any advice has, as yet, been issued to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment? From speaking to the chief executive of the board, it appears that it is currently reacting and because of a lack of resources it is unable to respond in the way in which it would like.The Minister referred to the board dealing with areas designated under the RAPID programme, and certain other areas but there are areas in which there are individual problems of non-attendance. Does the Minister believe the board is able to satisfactorily respond to all of these issues as they arise with the necessary degree of urgency?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I do not agree with the Deputy that progress has been disappointing. In setting up a new board it is always difficult to get it operational. People need to find their feet. It would be a big mistake to try and roll everything out at the one time. The board's approach to prioritising particular areas, first of all geographic areas, and second, children that are severely disadvantaged, is the right approach.In regard to the question about guidance to teachers, the board is undertaking consultations with schools, teachers, parents and others with regard to the services. It recently established a school implementation group to try and advise on the working arrangements with schools. That is the kind of co-operation and consultation that is taking place. Last February the board also issued a letter giving general information on the service. It has been agreed that further details will be sent to schools in the near future.I am not aware that any submission has been made to the NCCA. Frankly, I would not have expected the board to have made one so quickly. It will take some time for the board to discover the causes of absenteeism from school and to determine what parts of the curriculum, if any, are contributory factors.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I never expected the board to have 300 staff members. That number was mentioned in a report which was commissioned by the board itself. For that reason, I have asked the board to discuss the matter with the various other providers addressing absenteeism in schools. In its pre-budget submission, the board recommended ending a number of schemes which are currently in operation for disadvantaged persons and the transfer to it of the moneys involved. I do not agree with that approach nor do I agree with the report the board received which said it needed 300 staff on the ground. I have therefore asked the board to talk to people who are working on the ground at the moment.We have a home-school-community liaison scheme which has 503 co-ordinators in designated disadvantaged schools. Of these, 309 operate in the primary sector and 194 at post-primary level. There are 82 clusters of schools in the school completion programme and 40 visiting teachers. It is one aspect of the work of all of the above to deal with the problem of absenteeism and children who drop out of school. The priority for the board in the coming year should be to work out protocols whereby it will deal with the children who fall through the system. That would be a much better use of resources than adopting the attitude that the board has 700,000 pupils to consider and that it must do everything alone.

#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I welcome the establishment of the board and the move from sanctions to a welfare-based approach. Unfortunately, this approach will cost money. I note from the Minister's reply the number of staff to be employed by the board. Is the Minister aware that with this staff, the level of resources provided by the Department will allow the NEWB to provide an officer to only 26% of schools entitled to one? Is the Minister also aware that the board is legally obliged to provide this service? I am told that litigation has already begun. The theme at the press conference at which the NEWB launched its pre-budget submission was "save now, pay later". Unfortunately, if it continues to be the case that enough staff are not provided, we may be faced in 20 years time with litigation from young people who were not given the opportunity to take advantage of the system.Does the Minister have any proposals to increase the staff numbers? What is the timetable for the implementation of the Government's plan? The numbers are clearly inadequate. It was hoped that we would move away from the ad hoc approach when the board was set up. Instead of it always being a case of plugging holes, it was hoped that there would be adequate staff numbers to meet needs. We all accept the importance of employing welfare officers to find out what is happening to children who are not attending school. However, if the necessary resources are not provided, the consequences will be felt in the future. People are already talking about litigation, which worries me.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	353	Everybody welcomed the welfare approach to be adopted by the National Educational Welfare Board. I hope this approach continues to be adopted. For that reason, the NEWB should not consider itself in isolation as the only guardian of pupils who are in danger of dropping out of school or who are likely to be absentees. While it should consider itself to be the agency with responsibility for this problem, it should work in close co-operation with the various other parties to which I have referred. There are almost 700 people around the country who are specifically charged with the job of looking after children who are in danger of dropping out of school or who are involved in absenteeism. The mindset whereby the board considers itself to be the only body which can address the problem at this time is not helpful. I hope I can get that message across to the board when I meet with its members soon.The board should use the existing resources and it should not view itself in isolation. The function of the board should be to put protocols in place to ensure that the maximum number of children are covered. The service will be rolled out though not perhaps on the grand scale originally planned. It will be rolled out as resources permit. The board should focus on ways in which it can deliver the service with the personnel it has at the moment and with the help of the other people involved in this area.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	354	Funding for the youth affairs section of my Department for 2003 is €27.123 million, which represents a 5.5% increase over 2002. Provision for the youth work sector increased by almost 60% from 1997 to 2003 demonstrating the Government's commitment to supporting the work of the youth sector. I do not, therefore, accept that there is a serious financial shortfall in the sector. The cumulative increase since 1998 has been very significant and well ahead of inflation.I am conscious of the issues and concerns raised by people involved in the youth work sector regarding future funding for ongoing youth work programmes. Concerns have also been raised about services and the further implementation of the Youth Work Act 2001 and the national youth work development plan 2003-2007. The question of additional funding for the youth sector will be dealt with in the 2004 Estimates process. It is the nature of the Youth Work Act 2001 that it must be implemented incrementally. The national youth work development plan is intended to cover a five-year period. It was published earlier this year and its implementation will be phased as financial resources permit.

The Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy de Valera, has been ill and I take this opportunity to wish her well. I offer my support for her efforts to secure the €5 million which has been estimated to be needed next year to implement the Youth Work Act and the national youth work development plan.Does the Minister agree that we cannot afford to fail to implement these measures given the alternative? Youth work directs young people to positive rather than negative activities. The experience in my constituency, of which the Minister will be well aware, has been that youth work represents great value for money. There are 40,000 volunteers involved in the youth work sector.In real terms, the increase the Minister mentioned is a 4% decrease when inflation is taken into account. Does the Minister agree that the implementation of the Act has meant youth organisations had to draw money from other established funding to meet their obligations under the Act and the plan? I urge the Minister to provide the relatively small amount of money which is needed in the Estimates. I accept that he will not tell us the sum he is providing.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The Deputy is correct. I will not tell her what is being provided. I accept Deputy O'Sullivan's comments on the importance of youth work and of trying to maintain and increase as much as possible the level of support we have provided over the last couple of years. Circumstances in the Deputy's constituency in particular demonstrate what can happen where there is a lack of infrastructure and support for young people. The Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, and I are conscious of that. I thank the Deputy for her kind remarks about the Minister of State. No more than any other sector of the Education and Science budget, the youth budget will have to compete with a list of other priorities in the area. However, we will try to ensure that the 60% increase in funding since 1997 is maintained in this year's Estimates.

In March, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science received a presentation in regard to this issue, which emphasised that youth organisations are subject to requirements under the very good Youth Act which cost money. This means there are real implications for ongoing work if funding is cut.Is the Minister further aware that it costs €94,000 per annum to keep someone in prison and does he agree that if we spend money on youth work, we have a good chance of keeping a substantial number of people out of prison because they will be involved in youth activities? I urge the Minister to come up with the money in this regard.

However, I have received submissions from every other group which receives money from the Department, as well as increased calls for more teachers and more schools to be built and so on. Therefore, this request must take its place alongside the others. If I could get extra money from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's prison budget – which I might when two of them are closed – I would be delighted to use the money for youth work.

I also favour putting in place a multi-annual capital funding envelope for the next four or five years because the provision of such an envelope for the schools building programme will enable my Department to provide greater clarity for all education partners concerning the progress of projects within the programme.I am convinced that adopting a multi-annual approach to capital funding projects is the correct strategy and discussions are continuing with the Minister for Finance on this matter. The publication of the Estimates later this week will clarify the amount of capital I will have available for 2004. Based on the amount, the 2004 schools building programme will be finalised and I expect to be in a position to publish the programme on my Department's website no later than January 2004.In November 2002, I announced a pause in regard to all capital development in the third level sector pending clarification of the future funding position. I decided that it was prudent to re-evaluate and review the overall position in regard to third level capital projects and to establish priorities for future years. This review is currently being carried out by the Higher Education Authority at my request, to assess the entire set of demands in all publicly funded third level institutions, to establish prioritisation and agree rephasing.The programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, is a national priority which overarches all other demands for capital at third level and I indicated on Friday last that I will be making specific provision in the 2004 Estimates to enable the capital investment associated with cycle three of the programme to progress immediately. Details of the projects under cycle three of the PRTLI have already been published. Decisions in respect of other capital projects at third level will be taken when the review by the Higher Education Authority is complete.

We all favour a multi-annual programme but the Minister has told us there will be no change to the programme. Therefore, it appears there has been no progress in the Minister's discussions with the Minister for Finance. Will the Minister confirm that this is the case? I do not know what discussions the Minister is having with him but their fruits have yet to be made known.The Minister stated that he would publish his programme in January 2004. Does he know whether a multi-annual envelope will be available to him by that time? From the Minister's reply, it does not appear we will get any word of multi-annual funding tomorrow and that he will just deal with the 2004 Estimates. The Minister must appreciate the difficulties which are being experienced and the disappointment which will reign across primary and secondary sectors if no progress is made on the multi-annual funding issue.The junior certificate science syllabus has been implemented in some, but not all, schools. In that context, will the Minister confirm that he will prioritise bringing all laboratories up to date in the 2004 building programme, as he promised earlier this year? Will he comment on the INTO's stance on this issue and its threat of one-day strikes, since he has stated that such action would be in breach of Sustaining Progress?

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I thank the Deputy for acknowledging the announcement in regard to cycle three of the PRTLI. In the past 12 months, work has been ongoing with the finalisation of a number of projects in cycle two of the programme and I look forward to cycle three commencing in 2004.I did not say no progress had taken place in regard to multi-annual funding. As far as I am concerned, I have made good progress with the Minister for Finance. The last time I answered a question on this issue, I explained that it is not only the Minister for Finance and myself who are involved, rather, multi-annual programmes, particularly of a capital nature, must be negotiated with other Departments and no decision can be made in regard to any one Department until the figures and discussions are finalised for other Departments. We are now at the final stages of that process in regard to the multi-annual capital programmes. It will not be tomorrow, but I hope that we will shortly have a good idea of our capital envelope for the next three or four years.In regard to the introduction of the junior science programme, I am delighted that the ASTI has withdrawn its circular and that schools can now set about teaching the new junior science syllabus. The last time I checked, over 400 schools had applied to take up that option. We extended the closing date to 15 November because the decision was taken so close to the original closing date of 31 October.I indicated that the grants we promised, as well as the cases where science laboratories are necessary, will have priority within the capital budget this year at second level and I intend to carry that through. In some cases, refurbishment works or temporary structures may be required and money will be made available for them.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I am very much aware of the concerns of the INTO regarding capital funding for primary schools and have acknowledged that the significant levels of investment made in school buildings in recent years must be maintained if the goal of eliminating substandard accommodation is to be achieved.The major investment of recent years in upgrading school accommodation has resulted in new and enhanced school accommodation throughout the country. In the five years up to and including 2002, a total of €1.2 billion has been spent by my Department on primary and post-primary school buildings. This is a significant amount of investment.The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started, and to consolidating the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The Estimates published later this week will be part of that ongoing commitment.Regarding the threat of industrial action per se, I do not believe the interests of primary school children would be well served by any deliberate disruption to their tuition time. The Sustaining Progress agreement imposes clear requirements on all parties that have signed up to the agreement to maintain a stable industrial relations climate in the interest of ensuring the continuity of services.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I share Deputy Enright's concern that there does not appear to have been much progress regarding the multiannual funding programme. When the Minister published this building programme, and I know he intends publishing the new one in January, he suggested there was a great deal of transparency in it. Schools knew where they were and that they would progress relatively rapidly. If one looks at, for example, the primary section one can see that at stages 4 to 5, the advanced stage, there are approximately 20 schools in band 1 and 60 in band 2. Even if the Minister funds all 20 in band 1, the 60 or so in band 2 which consider themselves relatively far advanced, will be left waiting until at least the year after next and probably well into the future, unless he provides a substantial sum of extra money in the programme. I put it to the Minister that he is not going to make any significant progress on the school building programme unless there is significant funding. I know he will not tell us how much he is getting but there is serious worry and dissatisfaction among parents. We get letters regularly from parents concerned about the conditions in schools their children must attend. The evidence shows there will not be much sign of progress unless the Minister gets significant funding.Another issue I want to raise with the Minister is that of areas where there is rapid house building, not enough places in schools and an urgent need for new schools. I think particularly of areas like Naas which has a rapidly expanding population and which I visited a couple of weeks ago. What does the Minister intend to do in those areas where children will not have school places next September unless there is significant extra funding?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	368	Deputy O'Sullivan will recall that I said progress would be made in a transparent manner and as rapidly as funding allowed. The position remains the same. I cannot make rapid progress over and beyond the amount of money I have. Money is the important factor. I do not wish to give a smart answer to Deputy O'Sullivan but it would be better to wait and see the programme to find out whether progress is made. I know that no matter how much progress I make, Deputies on the opposite side of the House will say I have not made enough. It would be better to wait and see the programme before speculating as to which school might move and which might not. I will not do this other than in a transparent manner. I will not move schools on the list for political convenience. We had enough of that in the past. I want to get to a situation, which I believe I will achieve over the next couple of years, where when a school goes on the school building programme it will know that it will go to building stage within two or two and a half years. Putting schools into the programme just for the sake of having them there is not something I will do.There are problems regarding places in a number of developing areas, largely around the cities. My constituency, that of the Deputy, Kildare and others are affected. A number of applications for schools are being processed or will be processed and a number of sites have been bought. Where there is an urgent and rapid need for accommodation, it will be provided on a temporary basis until more permanent buildings can be put in place. We will try to ensure that the needs of these growing areas will be met as rapidly as possible. Initially, in many cases, it will be met by temporary buildings.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I assume that the Deputy's question refers to civic, social and political education which was first introduced on a pilot basis in 1993 and has been part of the core curriculum in all second level schools since September 1997.I understand that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has commissioned a survey of principal teachers and CSPE teachers on the operation of CSPE in schools. I have not had any advice or recommendations as yet from the NCCA on the contents of the CSPE course or its operation in schools.While some concerns have been expressed regarding the high turnover of CSPE teachers, the Deputy will understand that the allocation of teachers to subjects is a matter for the management and principals of second level schools. In the early years of the introduction of any new subject, principals may experience difficulties in assigning permanent staff to the teaching of that subject. This can mean that a higher than desirable turnover of staff is experienced in the subject, but this will normally improve over time. I understand that the NCCA survey shows that CSPE has many positive benefits for students, and that CSPE is working well in many schools.My Department has supported schools in the implementation of CSPE in a number of ways. A full-time CSPE support service was initiated in 1996. This service supports CSPE teachers by providing school-based and cluster-based inservice training to CSPE teachers, by advising individual teachers, and by advising school principals on more effective management and organisational structures for the teaching of CSPE. Since September 2001, about 2,500 teachers have attended inservice training provided by the CSPE support services. These services also liaise with non-governmental agencies to encourage their active participation in providing resource material and related inservice training to teachers of CSPE.As a further means of supporting CSPE teachers in their work, my Department created a team of part-time CSPE regional development officers in September 2001. Their task is to extend the work of the support service and to ensure that every CSPE teacher has this valuable resource made more accessible. The inspectorate in my Department has also been engaged in the evaluation of CSPE and the provision of advice to school management and teachers in recent years.Additional information.Provision has also been made for the future supply of teachers of CSPE. All third level teacher education faculties now provide a module on CSPE teaching as an optional part of their higher diploma in education courses.The NCCA is actively engaged in discussing the possibility of extending CSPE to leaving certificate level with the education partners. This is taking place within the context of the senior cycle review which is being conducted by the NCCA at present. Consultation on this review will come to an end in spring 2004. Following this period of consultation, I expect the NCCA to provide recommendations on senior cycle programmes in general, including CSPE.

I apologise for the error in my question.When does the Minister expect to receive the NCCA survey on principals' attitudes to the operation of CSPE in schools? What is the Minister's view of the course and are there plans to extend it to leaving certificate level? How many regional support officers are in situ and is the support service working to his satisfaction?

The NCCA is actively engaged in discussions on the CSPE programme with the various education partners. The discussions are also taking place in the wider context of the senior cycle review. I expect that, following the period of consultation on this and following their discussions, they will provide me with recommendations on the CSPE and the senior cycle programmes.

It appears to have been well received by students. The more we prepare students for life and civic society, the better. I certainly would be supportive of that generally. I would prefer not to comment directly on the specifics of the curriculum except to say that I support the broad thrust of it.On the second part of the question, the support service consists of one national co-ordinator, two full-time regional development officers, to whom I referred, and 22 part-time regional development officers. There is reasonably good back-up for it.

The programme accreditation committee of HETAC considered their report and accredited the programme, subject to all the conditions set by HETAC being met, including those relating to quality assurance. A certificate of course approval was issued in July 2003.As the designated authority for recognition of qualifications for the purposes of employment for the regulated profession of primary teacher, I have decided to recognise the qualification of graduate diploma in primary education of Hibernia College for the purpose of employment as a primary teacher provided all the conditions set by HETAC are met, including those on quality assurance.As part of the course, students will be engaged in teaching practice for a period of 14 weeks. A percentage of the students will be inspected by my Department's inspectorate in keeping with a standard formula applied to other providers.

Does he rely solely on the fact that HETAC validated it or does he apply other stringent hoops, so to speak, through which the college must go before the qualification is recognised?I believe there is no cap on the numbers attending Hibernia College. Does the Minister intend to introduce a cap or can he do so? Will this development affect the graduate diploma courses of other colleges, on which, I believe, there is such a cap? Does the Minister envisage a situation arising where all graduate diplomas will be done on-line?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	376	The basis on which I gave my recognition to this was largely the fact that the higher education body set up to establish the policies, criteria, etc., and to recognise third level courses did its job and made the recommendation in this regard. My only role in this was to recognise it for employment purposes. People could have done this course in any case. Had I not recognised it for entry to teaching, the course could have proceeded and people could have taken their chances. However, based on the HETAC approval and recommendations, following which a number of conditions were attached to the course, I recognised it for teaching purposes. The minimum requirement for the course applicants would be a degree.There is no cap on the numbers on the course. This is a commercial venture. I have no role in saying how many are enrolled in such courses. I am sure the market will decide that after a while. If too many primary teachers are produced as a result of this course and the others available, market forces will decide that there will not be jobs for them and people will not pay fees of €5,500 to obtain a qualification which would not be of much use to them. The market will decide that.The graduate diplomas which have been running in colleges in recent years will continue this year. They are always decided on an annual basis. An assessment is made of the vacancies that may be within the primary teaching sector and the number of places on the graduate diploma are decided on that basis. It will proceed this year in colleges.

Who has control over the numbers and ensuring adequate provision is made for the practical aspect of the course? Any number of people can complete the on-line part, but surely the practical subjects so important to primary teaching and the hands-on aspect of the training of primary teachers cannot be thrown to commercial ventures to do as they will. Will there be ongoing monitoring of this by the Minister, HETAC or whoever?The Minister stated that the course was approved in July. When was the application submitted? In other words, how long was the process of approval?Has the Minister a role in the use of education centres for this course run by Hibernia College? I understand these are being used and they are obviously publicly-funded.

Does it make sense that the Minister is allowing a part-time Internet course on the one hand while, on the other, his Department is calling for more skills?We acknowledge that one in ten primary school teachers are temporary. Does the Minister agree that, rather than opting for an ill-considered and half-baked course on which there was poor consultation, as this seems to be and let them prove otherwise, one way to ensure there are properly skilled teachers in the classrooms would be to examine the Irish language requirement in the recruitment of more teachers from Northern Ireland, for example, some of whom find it a major barrier?

Does the Minister know who is taking part in this on-line course? If not, who knows? Perhaps "vetting" is not the best word to use. Does the Minister know exactly who is doing the course? A paedophile could do it. While I do not wish to make accusations about people, someone unfit for teaching young children could enrol on this course. We should nip this in the bud, rather than discovering in six or seven months that certain people on this course are not fit to teach.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I am rather surprised by some of the comments made by Deputies in respect of this matter. The course is exactly the same as that run in the colleges at present and offers practical teaching experience. I suggest that the Deputies contact HETAC or Hibernia College and request further details about the course before making wild statements. I understand that between 40% and 50% of the course is delivered on-line, while the remainder is delivered through tutors. As with the postgraduate course, it offers practical experience. I have heard a great deal of nonsense about it taking three years to qualify from St. Patrick's College while people will now be able to qualify in 18 months. That is similar to comparing apples with oranges. There is an 18-month postgraduate course given by the colleges at present, and this is an 18-month course. Instead of people from Donegal, Kerry etc. being dragged away from home, they can access some of their tutorials and course work on-line. These individuals must, like everyone else, gain practical teaching experience and they are subject to the same level of inspection as teachers who qualify from St. Patrick's College, Mary Immaculate College or elsewhere.I was not surprised to hear the comments made earlier on phone-ins to radio shows, but I would expect more from Deputies.

I answered the question regarding the control of numbers. However, I reiterate that there is no control of numbers in respect of this course. There is a shortage of primary school teachers at present and we expect it to continue for a couple of years. This course will be useful in terms of ensuring that by 2005 we will be able to meet my aim and that of the teacher unions that unqualified teachers will not be involved. The course offers practical, hands-on experience and involves ongoing inspection. I cannot answer the question in respect of when it was submitted. I understand that it might have been submitted early last year, perhaps April or May, for consideration by HETAC.With regard to the use of education centres, such centres are entitled to make their own decisions regarding this matter. I understand that they are being paid for the use of their facilities. Education centres are there for the use and benefit of teachers, parents and anyone else, provided they are used for an educational purpose.The policing of the system is exactly the same as that which applies to the postgraduate courses offered in the colleges. I understand that approximately 90% of the people on the course are currently teaching at second level or are working as unqualified teachers at primary level.I do not know whether I should even answer the question relating to paedophiles on the course. I do not know whether—

The course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers. It was first provided in the 1995-96 academic year in four of the colleges of education and has been repeated on a number of occasions since then. The most recent course commenced in February of this year. My Department has requested the colleges of education to provide another course to commence early in 2004.

Perhaps he will answer the other part of the question which relates to the number of students he expects to sanction in these courses. There might be no harm in referring to the reply to the previous question which apparently indicates that an unlimited number can take the course offered by Hibernia College. I presume the number who will take the courses offered by the training colleges will be determined by the ability of the colleges to deal with certain numbers. This will be particularly relevant with regard to the practical subjects which take up a great deal of the time of students at both St. Patrick's College and Mary Immaculate College. Will the Minister indicate the amount of time required for practical subjects? I accept that I cannot ask about Hibernia College, which we have just discussed, but this issue is relevant to both questions.No new buildings have been put in place at Mary Immaculate College in 25 years and it is experiencing serious difficulties as a result in terms of accommodation. The college authorities want to be able to develop these courses further, particularly in light of the shortage of primary school teachers, but it faces a major crisis in respect of accommodation. I do not know if the Minister can indicate whether funding will be provided for the building programme at Mary Immaculate College, which was supposed to be top of the agenda before the third level budget was frozen.

There is an ongoing assessment, on an annual basis, of teachers' supply and demand needs. Those projected requirements are arrived at by taking a range of factors into consideration. I refer here to retirements, improvements in the PTR, special new posts in areas such as disadvantage or special needs, career breaks, job-sharing etc. When these are taken into account, a decision is taken on the number of places to be made available on postgraduate courses. This is the first occasion on which I have officially announced that these courses will be put in place.

There is nothing to stop the colleges of education doing what Hibernia College has done and providing some of their courses on-line. I would welcome that kind of competition.The numbers are determined each year by what we perceive will be the shortage or the necessity. As a result of the increased number of students we have allowed into the teacher training colleges in recent years, 1,400 are to graduate next year and I hope that by the end of the 2004-05 academic year we will have fully qualified teachers in all primary schools.

How many students will be sanctioned in 2004? Does he envisage all teacher training courses going on-line? Will this mechanism become the norm for teacher training? Does he agree peer interaction on courses is important for the development of teachers and that such interaction will be reduced substantially because of the on-line development?

The question relates to a postgraduate course and many of those who have taken up the course thus far have worked at second level. I do not have an objection to everybody doing the course on-line but I do not expect that to happen in the postgraduate area.I accept that in teaching and other professions peer interaction is important. The course provides for this through tutorials in education centres, 14 weeks of practical teaching experience and time spent in the Gaeltacht. That will allow interaction to take place. Interaction in the staff room while practical work is undertaken is also important. It is expected there will be 280 places on the postgraduate course this year.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	403	Since the beginning of 2000 my Department has spent €55,297,374 on the provision of prefabricated buildings in the primary and post-primary sectors. This expenditure was for the supply and installation of the prefabricated buildings, including associated site works and other costs such as professional fees and connections for water, electricity and sewage. The breakdown of this expenditure is €4,106,999 in 2000, €9,383,363 in 2001, €21,763,878 in 2002 and €20,043,134 to date in 2003. I have arranged to forward to the Deputy the detailed breakdown of this expenditure on a county by county basis.The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the past number of years, mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers, particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools. This additional accommodation is typically required on an urgent basis, for example, where a resource teacher or teachers have been provided and the provision of prefabricated buildings is the most effective way of addressing the immediate demand.A new pilot initiative was launched in 2003 to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level. The purpose of this initiative is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. The feedback from the 20 schools in the pilot initiative has been positive. It is expected that most will commence construction in the next few months. A review of the initiative is under way with a view to expanding it in 2004.

The history of the Government and the Minister in regard to school buildings is disastrous. It was reported in today's newspapers that a priest has decided to contribute his pension to the building of a new school. Does the Minister feel bad about that? Two schools in my constituency in Wexford have recently acquired a second prefabricated classroom. Both have applied for new school buildings in recent years but there is no sign of them being sanctioned. A total of €55 million has been spent on prefabricated buildings. Does the Minister agree applications from schools are being put on the long finger because the attitude is they were given prefabricated buildings a number of years ago and they will not get a new school building? The Government is throwing up prefabricated classrooms left, right and centre and pushing schools down the waiting list for new school buildings.

The number of primary school teachers, for instance, increased from 22,905 in September 2000 to 25,637 in September 2003 while the number of post-primary teachers increased from 17,117 to 17,668. Additional resource teachers have been appointed and more accommodation has been needed. The increased population in rapidly developing areas also led to an increase in temporary accommodation. It is not feasible in all cases to provide permanent solutions overnight. I would be heavily criticised if I did not provide temporary accommodation so that pupils could attend school. Temporary accommodation is precisely that and I assure the Deputy that if a school must use a prefabricated building because of pressure of numbers and it is on the building list, its place on the list will not be affected.

The school had hoped for a new building but opted last year for temporary accommodation. I ask the Minister to examine the school's case as a matter of urgency. The budget will be announced shortly and funding may be scarce in his Department but this is one of the few Protestant schools in the Republic in which the number of pupils is increasing and it is aggrieved. I would appreciate it if the Minister would do something.

I have experience of cases in which local committees have been allowed to provide permanent buildings, such as small extensions to schools. The work has been carried out more economically than would be the case if prefabs had been provided. A great bonus in that regard is the provision of a permanent building which will last for many years, rather than a temporary one which would have to be replaced after a few years. Is the Minister in a position to move that idea forward in the Department for particular types of work? The provision of permanent structures, rather than prefabs, should be pursued. I accept that this could not apply generally, but it could apply to certain types of work. I welcome the Minister's announcement that the pilot project initiated in 2003 is being considered with a view to future expansion.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	414	With regard to Deputy Stanton's question, leasing has been used in certain circumstances but it would not be the norm. Generally speaking, it is on the basis of purchase. It is left to the local schools concerned to make their own arrangements in many cases. On the question of prefabs as compared to permanent structures, I thank Deputy McHugh for his remarks. Last year's building programme included the devolved rural initiative for small schools in rural areas, whereby a set sum of money was given to the local community concerned in each case. Of the 20 schools involved, 13 were one-classroom schools, four had two classrooms and three had one classroom plus a resource learning support room. That is the direction in which I wish to proceed, where it is feasible in the local circumstances. It has been successful.In the repairs and refurbishment programme, we applied a similar approach to 20 projects, allocating a fixed sum of money and letting the local community make its own arrangements. Most people were willing to operate on that basis. Everybody whom we asked did so and the system appears to be working well. During the year, a number of groups in the circumstances to which the Deputy referred, having been authorised to obtain a prefab, came back to the Department with an alternative proposition for a permanent structure at a similar cost to that of the temporary building. In practically all cases, that suited and the Department gave the authorisation requested. That is the approach I wish to encourage. I believe it provides better value for money.

In late 2002 and early 2003, the National Centre for Technology in Education conducted a census of schools' ICT infrastructure following similar exercises in 1998 and 2000. The census found that since 1998 the total number of computers in first and second level schools increased from 36,000 to approximately 85,000. As a result, average pupil to computer ratios have reduced from 37:1 to just over 11:1 at primary level and from 16:1 to 9:1 at second level.

Improvements have been made, but does the Minister agree we need to go further? Is he satisfied with the use being made of computers provided for schools, in terms of maximum benefit to children? When the current three year strategy ends in December, has the Minister another strategy in place and what are his intentions in that regard?

It is a tribute to the efforts of our Defence Forces that they have been specifically requested to participate in this mission. Our thoughts and good wishes go with the Irish contingent in this new venture in terms of the number of dangers involved, above and beyond the norm. The possibility of having to deal with child soldiers and all that entails makes for a very difficult mission.I refer to the speech of my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, with particular reference to the peace mission Bill which he has sponsored. He has done a tremendous service to this House over the past few years by highlighting the need to look ahead in matters of defence and security. Irish peacekeeping forces have carved out a particular niche for which they have earned worldwide respect. However, there are changing scenes ahead in Europe and elsewhere. In the case of Macedonia, it is rather ironic that we could not become involved because of the UN situation there. Circumstances have arisen in which the UN has not been capable of taking on the heavy fire-power confronting its personnel. I hope the equipment supplied to our peacekeeping forces is in keeping with the best and most modern equipment available. If it is not, then we would be doing them a great disservice and putting them at risk. It is imperative we bear that in mind, as failure to do so would mean letting our troops down.It is the same for medical support, which will be more necessary for this mission than for any other since the Congo expeditions of the 1960s. We must keep in mind that the Defence Forces have never failed to live up to the commitment to and expectations of international peacekeeping. It is important for us to give them the backup and supplies which are necessary in sensitive areas like Liberia.A question which has aggravated some Members recently is that of international peacekeeping and peace enforcement. There are changes taking place whether we like it or not, even if the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, does not agree. We should never forget, as I have said before, that if a terrorist seized a cargo aircraft at this moment and headed for a major installation in Ireland we would have to seek outside help to deal with it. At this stage we do not know where we would seek that help because no decision has been made on this; threatening the pilot of the aircraft with a meeting of the Dáil or Seanad would do little to resolve the problem. It is necessary to review our defence and security commitments not just within the UN but within Europe. If we do not do so, who will accept responsibility here and say that we were remiss in not doing what we should have done? That is our responsibility as legislators and it is not the responsibility of lobby groups or anyone else. We should keep these issues in mind.I wish the mission every success, as it is important that it goes with our blessing and full support. However, we must also consider the various new threats that may confront our nation.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I thank Deputy Durkan for sharing his time. I am very supportive of this mission, as it is imperative to take any opportunity we get to make a contribution to world peace. There are probably some elements in the country which feel we should make no contribution in this area but Ireland has gained a lot of respect since we started peacekeeping in 1958 by sending observers to the Lebanon.The mandate of UNMIL – the United Nations Mission in Liberia – is straightforward. It includes the monitoring and implementation of the ceasefire and the comprehensive peace agreement between the Government and rebel forces. It also includes the disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration and repatriation of all armed parties. There are approximately 70,000 armed parties, many of them child soldiers, so this is perhaps the most difficult mission for Ireland since we went to the Congo. However, the Defence Forces would have sent out reconnaissance missions to make various assessments and I assume it is on their advice that the Government decided to go ahead with participation in the mission.It appears that in the initial stages Irish troops will be pathfinders beyond Monrovia. The risk assessment in Monrovia, according to the reports, is medium but it is high outside that area, so this will be a period of danger and concern for Irish troops. As others have said, I hope the Minister has ensured the force will have satisfactory equipment, because UN missions are often very vulnerable, irrespective of their support and firepower. When people ask me what it is like to serve overseas, as I have done, I always use the analogy of 40 or 50 Frenchmen in the GPO; if the local community wants to get them it can do so, as a local community always has the wherewithal to inflict casualties and then fade into the background. UN forces rely on the goodwill and co-operation of the local community, which is one of the main strengths of Irish troops and the reason the Irish are to the fore in virtually every peacekeeping mission. Due to our personality traits and professional training, Irish military personnel approach their work in a humane manner and are familiar with the varying degrees of force necessary, with the use of weaponry a last resort.The Irish mission, which will involve 430 personnel and a mechanised battalion, is to act as a rapid reaction force. This means that any time there are difficulties they will be deployed to the relevant area as back-up. They will be at the coalface both through pathfinding, which means securing areas in which troops can be permanently deployed, and as a rapid reaction force. The most important thing for any force is its own protection and medical backup. I am not sure what medical support is going with the mission – perhaps the Minister can clear that up – but staff shortages in our medical corps mean it is often difficult to get sufficient medical personnel. We should be sure the required medical complement is travelling with the force.One of the biggest drains on the Defence Forces at home is the provision of their own security, particularly when it comes to barracks security. We have some Kildare Deputies present who can tell the House that as one passes the Curragh one sees 50 to 100 people securing premises. The threat to our internal security has reduced dramatically in recent years and more electronic security surveillance equipment should be used to cut the man-hours spent on those mundane security duties. I wish the Minister and the Defence Forces well. I am sure they will carry out this mission in the same way they have carried out past missions.

I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on Ireland's participation in the United Nations Mission in Liberia through the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force there under the terms of Security Council Resolution 1509. Since the outbreak of civil war in Liberia in 1990 and the overthrow of the President Samuel Doe, this small west African country of 3.3 million people has descended into chaos and continuous conflict that has seen approximately 250,000 people dead, with more than 1 million uprooted from their homes.The election of warlord Charles Taylor as President in 1997 brought little of the hoped-for stability. Insurgency continued in Liberia until August this year, when Nigerian troops were the first to arrive to quell fighting between rebel groups and the forces of Charles Taylor. The Nigerian-led peace force succeeded in imposing a ceasefire in Monrovia, ending fighting that had caused the deaths of over 1,000 civilians in the city.There was widespread relief when Charles Taylor resigned under pressure on 11 August of this year, leading to a power-sharing peace deal between the Government and rebels. Taylor's destabilising influence on the country and region has been obvious. His invasion of Liberia from the Ivory Coast in 1989 was the spark that set off the civil war, and his financial support for rebel forces in Guinea, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone created enormous hardship in these countries.His main ally, the Revolutionary United Front, has been accused of widespread torture and sexual assault. In June 2003, a UN-backed court indicted Taylor for crimes against humanity during the civil war in Sierra Leone.In the aftermath of his destructive regime much effort is now needed to revive the country. It is potentially one of Africa's richest but, with 80 % of the population living below the poverty line, the challenge facing the new power-sharing government of restoring electrical and other communication systems while at the same time meeting the needs of hundreds of thousands of civilians still living as refugees is truly enormous. Ireland has already contributed €2.5 million for emergency humanitarian assistance this year and the Government has indicated that further assistance can be made available. It is, however, obvious that peace must be firmly established before the task of rebuilding this ravaged county can begin in earnest.During Ireland's membership of the UN Security Council from 2001 to 2002 our representatives took a particular interest in the Liberian situation and were among the strongest supporters of targeted sanctions on the Taylor regime to prevent it from further destabilising the region. It is, therefore, perfectly consistent with that position to now want to help build a lasting peace in Liberia and the region.In approving the motion before the House today, Dáil Éireann will open a new chapter in Ireland's international peacekeeping history, which began more than 40 years ago in Congo and which continued through distinguished involvement in Cyprus, Lebanon, Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor and Somalia. UNMIL's specific mandate includes providing support for disarmament, demobilisation, reunification and monitoring the terms of the ceasefire agreement, including human rights violations, facilitating humanitarian relief efforts, protecting civilians, establishing the conditions for the safe return of refugees and internally displaced people and supporting the national transitional government and the creation of conditions under which elections can be held.The enormity of the challenge is not to be underestimated, not least when we consider the extremely volatile situation which still exists in Liberia. In the past week the Associated Press reported on a tour of the rebel-held far east of the country, undertaken by the Kenyan commander of UNMIL, General Opande, in which he saw hamlet after hamlet still bloodied by pillaging fighters or persistent clashes between rebels and government hardliners, and this in a country where 10% of the child population has been forced to take up arms.There is no denying the high risk nature of the mission the Minister is asking the House to support, neither is there any escape from the duty that befalls us as members of the international community presented with a specific UN request for participation. It is interesting in this context to note reports that nearly 380 volunteers have come forward already to take up positions on what will eventually be a 430 member contingent. This level of volunteering against a background of known military dangers and significant other health risks speaks volumes of the courage and determination of the members of the Irish Defence Forces which have been well demonstrated in the past. I am reminded of the words of Bill Clinton when he visited here in 1998: "I would like to just say, because I can't leave Ireland without acknowledging this, that there are few nations that have contributed more than Ireland, even in times which were difficult for this country, to the cause of peace and human rights around the world".I appreciate the comments of the Army officers representative body, RACO, which has expressed concern about the level of medical back-up that will be available for troops on this mission. I lend my voice to the call for no effort or cost to be spared to ensure that the necessary medical facilities will be made available. The director of the Army Medical Corps has stated that systematic use of anti-malaria medication is likely to be effective and we are assured that all personnel will be fully immunised against other known diseases. We can further take heart from the fact that, for the first time in its history, the Army is fully equipped to take on a challenge such as that presenting itself in Liberia, but it is important that our troops continue to be fully resourced throughout the mission.The cause of peace transcends all other challenges, whether in the Middle East, the Western Balkans, Africa or on our island of Ireland, and determined efforts to build a secure and durable peace must be tirelessly pursued. I commend the motion to the House and wish those admirable women and men who will undertake the mission well.

The current civil conflict in Liberia is attracting worldwide attention. It is an issue that must be dealt with immediately. I notice that my Kildare colleagues are present and I am aware that this is an issue of particular importance to them because many of the soldiers who have graciously and bravely volunteered for this dangerous but important mission are, in the main, from the constituencies in Kildare, although soldiers come from all over the country, and Dublin South-Central has its fair share of soldiers who at all times are ready to do their duty. I wish all those who have volunteered well on their leaving and, more importantly, I wish them a safe return.It is imperative that we take action in Liberia because of the conflict, war and terrible abuse of human rights that is taking place there. The fear of conflict is also spreading further to Sierra Leone and Guinea. Sierra Leone has moved into peace mode in recent years and it would be a tragedy for war to break out again in that region. Quick action will help to end the regional instability. We must try, by operating within Liberia, to preserve the peace in Sierra Leone.Since 1998 thousands of people have been killed in the region and tens of thousands have fled. There is worldwide concern about the abuse of human rights there, which is a pressing issue. The Liberian troops have been responsible for multiple raids, tortures, killings and rapes of women and children. Young children are also facing other dilemmas – malnutrition, disease and fatalities. Numerous rebel groups there are carrying out the same horrific acts as other government parties.The organisations which are at war have immense control over the people in Liberia. There is great fear there and an increasing number of young people are suffering greatly. Young boys in particular are recruited by rebel groups and armies across the region. Most of these young boys are not from secure families but are fleeing terrible situations. It is estimated that 15,000 child soldiers are fighting for all the parties in the conflict. They tend to be young men in their late teens from broken backgrounds. If they do not join up willingly, they are forcibly recruited and many times threatened with death to themselves or their families. They are given AK-47s to operate as some members of UNICEF found while travelling through Liberia giving aid. It was said that these young boys were given drugs to make them brave and dull them into submission. They were drugged to help them cope with the loneliness and fear they experienced each day.It is imperative that our troops engage in this mission in Liberia and for that reason I support this motion. I note all previous speakers have also supported it. I am delighted there is unanimous support for the bravery and loyalty attached to the great work in which our Army and soldiers are at all times engaged.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion and wish the contingent of our Defence Forces well in their forthcoming assignment to Liberia. In wishing them well, I hope they will have a satisfactory tour of duty and a safe return to our shores. The members of the Defences Forces have been wonderful ambassadors for this country over a long period. For the past 40 to 50 years they have done a wonderful job for us on the international stage. Unfortunately, that stage is also one where they have put their lives on the line on a daily basis. Sadly, many have lost their lives in far-off parts of the world. With God's help, we will not see the recurrence of such sad events with regard to this contingent.Such opportunities of active service are looked forward to by members of the Defence Forces. I, as well as Deputies Ó Fearghaíl and Seán Power, represent constituencies with large numbers of members of the Defence Forces. We know that they look forward to these active service overseas missions. This is what they were trained for and want to do. When overseas, they take pride that they are representing the Defence Forces, and Ireland in a wider sense, in a peacekeeping mission.This mission to Liberia will be one of the most difficult, as the Minister for Defence has stated, that we face. It is not just of concern to Members, but also to the families and friends of these volunteers from the Defence Forces. It is necessary that the logistical operation takes into account these families and friends, as well as the participants. I ask the Minister for Defence to ensure that communications between families and members of the Defence Forces are not held up in any way, eliminating doubts over a much-awaited letter or communication. Members can state that we fully support the mission. However, there is the obvious need that the families and friends of those involved also support it. This will only be done through the communications they will send to the troops in Liberia.There have been concerns expressed by RACO with regard to the health aspects of this mission. There is a high prevalence of tropical diseases in Liberia. I am pleased to note that this was addressed by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, at the RACO conference in Tralee. I am glad that the health aspect of the mission has been addressed as well as the material ones. We must lend our weight whenever a family member of a peacekeeper approaches us on the matter. We must also know that the Defence Forces have the utmost confidence in the health teams in Liberia. If one of our troops should unfortunately fall prey to one of the many diseases there, the mechanisms must be there to airlift him or her home or provide adequate health care in the field.The volunteer aspect of such an assignment is of vital importance. Local and national newspapers have claimed that the mission is not a totally voluntary one. However, I hope that by the time the troops go to Liberia, we will see full voluntary participation, as it will lend to blending the whole team together. When we have the required number of volunteers willing to put their training to the test, it always helps build the better team and ensures the success of such ventures. We have read the statements from the Minister for Defence, other Members and the newspapers concerning the problems facing this peacekeeping mission. When we see Liberian children playing out in the fields, we must remember they are playing with guns and are exposed to the dangers of live mines and mortars. This is a whole new field for this young nation with such potential to address. However, through our Defence Forces and in our own way, we will assist in the creation of a peaceful Liberia, allowing it to develop and move forward to free elections. In that way, it can be said that Ireland will have helped in the development of a country and developed a friendship through the visits of the Defence Forces.I ask the Minister for Defence to monitor the ongoing security threat in Liberia. If our troops are moved away from the capital, then we will see the intensity of that threat increased. It is important that Members are frequently updated on this matter. In my constituency, and in those of Deputies Ó Fearghaíl and Seán Power, there is a mainstay of people who will be directly concerned. We will appreciate updates on the security problems in Liberia. However, it is hoped that the UN will ensure that those security problems diminish before our troops go there.I support the initiative. It is a phase in the development of the Defence Forces that will see them again act as ambassadors for Ireland. I have always seen the Defence Forces as part of the Celtic tiger in that they created such a positive image for Ireland around the world. They will do us proud. We only ask that the Department of Defence will ensure that all mechanisms and logistics for equipment and health services that are necessary for such a successful operation are put in place. The most important logistical demand is to ensure communications between members of the Defence Forces and their families. There can be cases where it falls by the wayside. However, I ask the Minister for Defence to ensure that it is dealt with on an ongoing basis and any problems are quickly erased. As we face Christmas, it is a difficult time for soldiers to leave their loved ones for such far-off fields with the concern of what awaits them. I am sure the communications aspect of the mission will be addressed by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	432	A new chapter will be written in the history of the Defence Forces next month when 430 personnel commence a mission to Liberia. This is a decision that has not been taken lightly. Much information was collected and gathered before the decision was taken and we were better equipped than ever in making that decision. No guarantees can be given for the safety of troops on a mission. However, on balance, the judgment this time was reasonably good. The best thing Members can do is to wish the troops well on the mission, and to hope they have an enjoyable tour and return home safely.It is appropriate that we should debate the issue in the House. Yesterday when addressing the RACO conference in Tralee, the Minister explained that we are sending a mission that is properly trained and equipped to do the job the UN is requesting and it is vital that it is properly resourced for the job. As other Members have said, our Defence Forces have a very proud record of serving with the United Nations throughout the world.A few years ago, I had the pleasure of visiting Lebanon when the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, unveiled a plaque in memory of those who had given their lives while on duty in Lebanon. It brought home to me the sacrifices that Irish men and women are prepared to make on behalf of this country and in the interests of restoring peace throughout the world. We probably take this for granted. Nobody can make a greater sacrifice than to give his or her life, and many Irish men and women have been and continue to be prepared to make that ultimate sacrifice.Overseas service is a very important part of army life. Members of the Defence Forces spend much of their time training and these missions offer an opportunity to put their training into action. While a number of them have been on overseas missions, the mission to Liberia will bring new challenges. While the population is small, certain practices, including the use of guns, especially by very young people, will offer a particular challenge. However, I know our troops are well equipped and prepared to deal with them.Deputy Ó Fearghaíl mentioned the number of missions in which troops have been involved. Despite the tremendous work and the success our Defence Forces have had abroad, it is most unfortunate that so little of this is reported back home. I appeal to the Minister to use his Department's PR machine and that of the military authorities to explain this clearly to people. To do justice to those who serve abroad and make such a sacrifice, it is only fitting that their work should be reported on a regular basis back home. This would be very good for the education of the Irish people. Unfortunately, it is only when things go wrong and when dead soldiers return to Ireland that we realise what is going on, the work they are doing and sacrifices they are making. I hope the structures can be put in place to ensure there is regular reporting of the mission that is about to go to Liberia.While I do not believe there has been a formal request to the Government, there has been mention of Ireland taking part in a mission to restore peace and normality in Iraq. In present circumstances, I hope that the Government will not agree to a request to serve there. It is only fitting that those who were spoiling for a fight should be given the opportunity to clean up the mess they created. Members of the Irish Defence Forces should not be asked to take the risk involved in serving in a place such as Iraq.I support the motion. I wish those serving in the mission well and a safe passage home.
#MichaelJWoods	unknown-#MichaelJWoods-party	unknown-#MichaelJWoods-dob	unknown-#MichaelJWoods-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The Irish Defence Forces have made an extremely valuable contribution to UN peacekeeping over the past half century. As the Dáil is invited to consider approving Ireland's 42nd UN peacekeeping mission it is worth reflecting on the significance of our involvement. Since 1958 Irish troops have been involved in some of the most difficult and conflict-riven regions in the world.It is our job to ensure that our troops are fully prepared to operate in these circumstances. The Department of Defence in its recent presentation to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs detailed the more comprehensive preparation of our troops for active duty on any UN mission that takes place today. This training ensures that our soldiers, with modern equipment, are capable of dealing with all the threats they are likely to encounter on active duty.An ongoing evaluation of peacekeeping is carried out not only nationally but also in the UN where lessons learnt on previous missions are incorporated into future planning. We have been assured that any Irish soldier who has volunteered to go to Liberia under this proposed UN mission goes with the training to do the job to the highest possible standard and to ensure his or her own safety. Any troops that go will need such training as the work of those involved in this operation will be extremely difficult. When this is coupled with the health risks that accompany any service in west Africa there is no doubt that we are assigning a difficult task to our troops.There are, however, compelling reasons for the Government to request the Dáil to approve the participation of up to 450 Irish troops in the UN mission to Liberia. The Liberian state and the wider west African region urgently need an era of peace and stability. Since 1989 Liberia has been ravaged by civil war and since 1997 by the worst excesses of corruption and lawlessness under the regime of the recently departed Charles Taylor. Now under the peace agreement of Accra, signed in August of this year, and with the allocation of 15,000 troops under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, there is a real opportunity to provide a stable environment for the elections scheduled for 2005.When law and order is established, the transitional government will be able to address the huge social problems afflicting the country where there is 80% unemployment, only 26% of the population have access to running water and less than 40% have adequate sanitation. Success in this project will complement the UN's efforts in Sierra Leone and in the Ivory Coast, where Irish troops are on active duty and raise the prospect of long-term peace in west Africa.Other considerations also influence this motion. The African Union founded on 26 May 2001 has indicated that lack of peace and security is one of the greatest obstacles to normalising society in Africa. In our recent fact-finding mission in Zambia and South Africa, members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs were reminded by Ministers and Members of Parliament of the importance of trying to end conflict on the continent. By providing this force we acknowledge the importance of what the African states are trying to achieve and strengthen the great work already being done by Irish missionaries, NGOs and Development Co-operation Ireland on the continent of Africa.Committing troops to Liberia will not only be a real show of solidarity with those trying to achieve results in Africa, it will also be a strong demonstration of support for the United Nations and its worldwide efforts to bring peace, stability, education, improved health services, sanitation, water and power supplies to the least developed nations and their peoples.Ireland is a neutral country. We believe that there are better models for conflict resolution than warfare and we as a nation wish to see greater adherence to the rule of international law. Since we have decided that the UN is the vehicle through which this can be best achieved we must throw our weight behind even the toughest of tasks. Anything short of that and the neutrality to which we proudly adhere will be severely weakened.It is a great source of pride for every Irish citizen that we have played such a positive and effective role in peacekeeping. Passing this motion will maintain that proud tradition and keep faith with all those brave Irish soldiers who have risked their lives and in some cases given their lives in the service of mankind.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	436	As has been enunciated, the Green Party is in accord with the consensus in this House that this mission should proceed. We have an honourable record in answering the call of the UN and we have done so to a greater extent than many other countries in the world. It is important that that sanction applies when we allocate Irish troops regardless of regrets that have been expressed about other areas of conflict in the world where, as a neutral country, we are unable to participate.In saying that and in giving the sanction of the House to this mission, we have to be cognisant of the fact that this is the most dangerous setting that Irish soldiers are likely to have been in since the initial UN deployment in the Congo, which sadly resulted in many deaths in the Defence Forces. We can only hope that the volatile situation in Liberia will be eased by the existence of a strong UN force and the proper contribution of an Irish contingent within that force.The difference between this and any likely deployment, such as Iraq, if approved, is that the UN entering a situation aggravated by countries such as the US acting unilaterally will encounter the widespread disapproval that exists on the ground. That situation would be even more difficult. I hope the House will not have to confront it and ask Irish soldiers to go into Iraq. The current world climate is putting at risk the idea of the UN being perceived as a neutral force and this was exemplified by the bomb in Baghdad. I hope the situation in Liberia will not deteriorate accordingly. Many people do not understand the niceties of international diplomacy, and the significance of the "blue hat". The fact that they will deal with heavily armed child soldiers is not a risk that will compromise the Irish Defence Forces whom we are asking to do this job on the UN's behalf and who ultimately represent this country.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Sinn Féin will support this motion in keeping with the party's commitment to the UN system and positive neutrality in action. We believe that as a UN-led multi-dimensional operation, UNMIL is a worthwhile endeavour. It includes political and military initiatives and involves civilian police, criminal justice, civilian affairs, human rights, issues of gender, child protection, disarmament, demobilisation and re-integration along with public information and electoral components, co-ordinated with humanitarian and development efforts. On this basis approximately 380 Irish people have so far volunteered for this mission.It can never be an easy decision to take such a personal risk and leave family and friends concerned about one's safety. The sum of such personal decisions can have a tremendous positive impact on the world. Irish involvement in UN peacekeeping is a source both of national pride and international prestige. It will be a difficult task, all the more so because of recent attacks on UN personnel in other regions. I note the concern by RACO and PDFORRA about available medical cover for troops and the prevalence of disease including malaria and HIV. I am particularly concerned about the potentially psychotic effect of anti-malarial drugs as reported by other forces. I would appreciate a full report from the Minister on the measures and precautions being taken in this regard.As regards potential HIV transmission, I am pleased to note that the office of the special representative of the UN Secretary General in Liberia has appointed not only a HIV-AIDS policy adviser and support staff to assist with prevention among military personnel as well as civilians but also a senior gender adviser with support staff. Such UN support must be matched by the Government which has a responsibility to ensure that Irish troops are equipped with both the knowledge and supplies necessary for their protection. Will the Minister assure the House that these reports will also be made available?I am concerned about the risk posed to Irish Defence Forces by any proposed mission. We should not insult the intelligence of those who have volunteered by suggesting, as some people have, that only safer missions under EU or NATO leaderships should be undertaken. These peacekeepers are professionals. They are aware of the dangers and have taken these factors into account in making their informed decisions. They have balanced personal risk against the potential to make a contribution towards alleviating the suffering of the Liberian people who, for more than 15 years, have lived through abuses of human rights, including arbitrary killings and the massacre of civilians, disappearances, torture, rape, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced conscription and the use of child soldiers. These people have endured all the deprivation of their basic needs and rights as a result of protracted conflict.The decision by individual members of the Defence Forces must be recognised as a brave and selfless choice worthy of respect. While I have indicated our support for this motion, as legislators we must closely monitor the progress of this mission and take further decisions as necessary and appropriate in response to developments which may be unforeseen. I offer my best wishes to the troops for success in their mission and a safe return to Ireland.

That is not reflected in Liberia at present. It is war-torn and the American influence is still strong. The American-English language is in use and the dollar is the currency. Liberia has sought external intervention to rescue its people from the civil war that has engulfed the country since the Americans disengaged in the 1990s at the end of the Cold War. The UN estimates that about half a million people are displaced. It is something that cannot be taken lightly.A number of issues must be considered regarding the deployment of peacekeeping forces at headquarters in Liberia. The UN is going there to do valuable work. Our reputation has been substantially enhanced internationally because of the type of work our soldiers have done abroad. They have done us proud. It is one reason Irish people find they are respected when they travel abroad.PDFORRA has recently appealed to the Government to exercise caution because of the security threat. It says the Government should put at-risk assessment at the top of its agenda in all cases of overseas peacekeeping participation. I believe continuous at-risk assessment must be put in place. If it turns into a chronic war-torn situation, perhaps our troops should back off.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I thank the House for its recognition of the importance of Ireland's and the Defence Forces' contribution to international peace and security. I am especially grateful for the kind words and the compliments from Deputies regarding the manner in which the Defence Forces have discharged themselves on these missions. The debate reflects the high regard in which the Defence Forces are held internationally as peacekeepers and the warm regard in which they are held by the Irish people while recognising the important role they play in the communities they serve here and abroad.As we face the challenge in Liberia, we know there are risks and that these should not be underestimated. The significant presence of child soldiers, including girls, the proliferation of weapons, the continued operation of armed groups and criminal elements throughout the country and lack of communications control and organisation among and within the various components of the rebel and militia groupings all pose major security risks for the personnel being deployed. Against this background, I assure the House that the decision to go to Liberia was not taken lightly. In considering any mission, our ability to protect the health and safety of our personnel is of paramount importance. However, all missions involve some element of risk.A full assessment of the UNMIL mission was undertaken, including a comprehensive and detailed reconnaissance by an experienced Defence Forces team, before the final decision was made. I am assured by the military authorities that, while the situation is difficult and volatile, they are satisfied they can discharge their mandates in an effective manner and maintain the safety of their personnel. To this end the Defence Forces are deploying significant force protection assets and medical support. The ultimate care is being taken in the testing and inoculation of personnel against known diseases. Having regard to the importance of this mission to peace and stability in the region, Ireland's abiding interest in Africa and its development and the requests from the UN for our participation, the Government is satisfied that we should take part in the mission.Deputy Gay Mitchell asked about the naval vessel. The Navy vessel, LE Niamh, was deployed with the reconnaissance group to provide logistical support, communications and accommodation. It also brought out transport vehicles. We deployed the vessel as we had no personnel on the ground and were advised there were no facilities for the reconnaissance group. The naval vessel returned to Ireland when the reconnaissance mission was completed.I outlined in some detail in my initial presentation the various medical facilities being provided to personnel deployed in Liberia. I am assured they fully meet the requirements of the mission. At the RACO conference yesterday its president indicated satisfaction with what is being proposed. All personnel to be deployed are being provided with all their inoculations. The director of the Medical Corps has also had detailed consultations with the Royal College of Surgeons regarding tropical disease aspects and the risks involved. I assure the House that the medical personnel, including doctors, to provide for the Defence Forces contingent will be deployed on an ongoing basis. A wide range of equipment and force protection assets are being deployed by the contingent. This equipment is of the highest quality. Mowag APCs performed effectively when deployed with the Defence Forces when they served in UNMEE. We are also deploying armoured vehicles and support weapons, heavy machine guns and a mortar platoon.Deputy Michael D. Higgins suggested that serving personnel were not consulted in regard to operational matters. The final decision in regard to deployment to Liberia did not take place until the Defence Forces themselves had undertaken a detailed reconnaissance. Arising from this reconnaissance, the Chief of Staff advised me that while there are risks he was satisfied that these could be contained and that this was an appropriate mission for the Defence Forces. All operational matters regarding the deployment of force protection assets and medical facilities are decisions taken within the military establishment.A number of Deputies raised questions about the triple lock, the legal provisions of the Defence Acts, the EU constitution and the PfP. These are matters for another day, as we are concentrating on Liberia.There was some suggestion that Ireland should only embark upon a mission where there was absolute certainty in regard to safety and no threat to our personnel. I cannot accept this stance. Ireland has long recognised its obligations to support peace and security throughout the world, which can sometimes mean operating under difficult and dangerous circumstances. We cannot always wait for peace to happen, sometimes we need to help establish and maintain it. Ireland will not falter in its obligations in this regard.Deputy Gormley inquired about the rules of engagement under Chapter VII of the UN charter. I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is vitally important that the personnel being deployed on difficult and dangerous missions be given the appropriate authority to use all means at their disposal to discharge their mandate. The Defence Forces have previous experience of such missions, including UNAMET in East Timor, SFOR in Bosnia, KFOR in Kosovo and UNMEE in Eritrea. Under a Chapter VII mission, personnel are entitled to use force, up to and including deadly force, to defend and protect themselves, UN personnel, international personnel and, within their capabilities, civilians where there is an immediate threat to life or bodily harm.The primary role of the Army ranger wing is to provide special reconnaissance liaisons and intelligence and may be required to provide close protection. The Army ranger wing will operate at the direction of the force commander and will provide him with advice on special operations.I do not have time to conclude all points but in regard to communications and other questions raised about soldiers making contact with their homes and so on, these facilities are being provided. We will do everything we can to ensure that this kind of contact and personal matters are dealt with, especially coming up to Christmas.I thank all Deputies who contributed on the debate for the interest they have taken in this matter and the kind remarks they made about members of the Defence Forces. We hope and pray that they will be able to manage, not just successfully, but to get back home safely as well.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to bring the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2003 before the House. I propose first of all to summarise the background and context of the Bill, the basic aim of which is to strengthen the industrial relations procedures given effect through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001. I will then describe the purpose and reasoning behind each section of the Bill.The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature. The fundamental approach of successive Governments to industrial relations has been one of voluntarism. There is a consensus among the social partners that the terms and conditions of employment of workers are best determined through the process of voluntary bargaining between employers and workers and between employers' associations and one or more trade unions or staff associations. This approach to industrial relations has served us well over the years. In general, our laws do not try to impose a solution on parties to a trade dispute, but rather are designed to help support the parties in resolving their differences. The State has, in general, confined its role to underpinning voluntarism through the provision of third party industrial relations machinery.We have a number of dispute resolution services which are at the disposal of workers and employers to assist them in resolving their differences. The Labour Relations Commission alone chairs over 2,000 meetings per year, 80% of which are settled at conciliation. Issues not resolved by the Labour Relations Commission may be referred for investigation to the Labour Court. In 2002, almost 600 cases referred to the Labour Court under industrial relations and other legislation were completed. Despite the fact that the majority of recommendations issued by the court are non-binding, there is an acceptance rate of more than 80% by parties to the disputes.The Government, however, recognises that there is a need for dispute settling mechanisms in cases where employees wish to be represented by a trade union or accepted body but collective bargaining does not take place. Under Partnership 2000, a high level group comprising representatives from IBEC, the ICTU, the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach was set up to devise a mechanism for resolving such disputes. In its final report the group recommended that two distinct procedures be put in place. Its recommendations laid the foundations for the procedures we have in place today.The first procedure is a voluntary one provided for through the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution – SI 145 of 2000 – which was prepared by the Labour Relations Commission, in consultation with the ICTU and IBEC, and promulgated by the Tánaiste in May 2000.In essence, the code of practice provides procedures for the negotiated resolution of these disputes. The process under the existing code of practice for the successful resolution of a dispute can be summarised in four steps. First, the dispute is referred to the Labour Relations Commission, which appoints an officer from its advisory service to assess the issues in dispute. The advisory officer of the Labour Relations Commission works with the parties in an attempt to resolve the issues in dispute. In the event that the issues in dispute are not capable of early resolution by the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, an agreed cooling-off period is put in place. During the cooling-off period, the commission's advisory service continues to work with the parties in an attempt to resolve any outstanding issues. The commission may engage expert assistance, including the involvement of the ICTU and IBEC, should that prove helpful to the resolution of any differences. If, after the cooling-off period, all issues have been resolved, the Labour Relations Commission disengages. Before disengaging, the commission may make proposals to the parties for the peaceful resolution of any further grievances or disputes. In the event of issues remaining unresolved after the cooling-off period, the Labour Relations Commission makes a written report to the Labour Court on the matter.The second procedure, a legislated fall-back procedure, was provided for through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001. This Act gave new dispute-settling powers to the Labour Court in cases where no arrangements for collective bargaining are in place.Under the 2001 Act, disputes may be referred unilaterally by an authorised trade union or accepted body to the Labour Court in a case where all of the following circumstances pertain. First, it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and the internal dispute resolution procedures normally used by the parties concerned have failed to resolve the dispute. Second, the employer has failed to observe a provision of the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution, which I mentioned earlier, or has failed to observe such a provision in good faith.Third, neither the trade union nor the employees, as the case may be, have acted in a manner which, in the opinion of the court, has frustrated the employer in observing a provision of such code of practice. Fourth, neither the trade union nor the employees, as the case may be, have had recourse to industrial action after the dispute in question was referred to the commission in accordance with the provisions of the code of practice.If a case satisfies these criteria, it may be investigated by the Labour Court. Such an investigation may result in a recommendation, where appropriate, of the action which should be taken. There may also be a review of all relevant matters which may result in the making of a determination by the Labour Court. A review of the determination by the court may be carried out. It may also be possible to make an application to the Circuit Court for an order directing an employer to carry out the determination or review of the determination. Ultimately, therefore, the 2001 Act provides for the issuing of a binding determination by the Labour Court which is enforceable through the Circuit Court.The Bill proposes to strengthen the procedures in the 2001 Act in line with commitments in the national agreement, Sustaining Progress. In the negotiations on Sustaining Progress, the trade union and employer organisations agreed that there was a need to enhance the effectiveness of the procedures put in place by the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 and the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution. Section 8.9 of part II of Sustaining Progress sets out seven specific measures which were agreed between the Government and trade union and employer representatives to enhance the effectiveness of existing procedures.The first measure is the introduction of "an indicative overall timeframe targeting 26 weeks – with provision for up to a maximum of 34 weeks where necessary – for the processing of cases under the dispute resolution code and Act to the point of issuance of a determination, save when an extension is agreed by the parties". This measure sets out the timeframe agreed by the Government and trade union and employer representatives for the completion of cases under an enhanced code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution and the amended legislation. Allowance has been made for the extension of the timeframe from 26 to 34 weeks, if necessary. The introduction of a timeframe will shorten the length of time required to process a case through the code of practice and Labour Court procedures.The second measure is the amendment of section 2 of the Act to provide that engagement by the court can now take place on the basis of a breach of the timeframes within the code, the exhaustion of the timeframes or the indication at any time by the Labour Relations Commission that it is unable to assist the parties. These provisions shall be substituted for the existing section 2(1)(b), while preserving the remainder of the section. This measure requires changes to the conditions to be met under section 2(1)(b) of the Act of 2001. It will facilitate the transfer of responsibility for cases from the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission to the Labour Court.The third measure is the amendment of section 3 of the 2001 Act to allow the court to combine the preliminary and substantive hearings where it considers this to be appropriate. Under section 3, the Labour Court may hold a preliminary hearing to determine whether the conditions set out in section 2 of the Act have been met. This measure will permit the combination of the preliminary hearing with the hearing of the case. However, the Labour Court may still hold a separate preliminary hearing if it so wishes.The fourth measure is the removal of the provision in the Act which requires the Labour Court to review a determination prior to seeking enforcement of a determination by the Circuit Court. This will be achieved by deleting section 9 and amending section 10 to entitle the trade union or excepted body to apply to the Circuit Court for the enforcement of a determination immediately or on expiry of whatever implementation period is provided for in the determination. This measure was designed to contribute to the speeding up of the processing of cases to facilitate achievement of the agreed timeframes.The fifth measure is the introduction of a new code which sets out the different types of practice which constitute victimisation arising from an employee's membership or activity on behalf of a trade union or a manager discharging his or her managerial functions, or other employees, drawing, as appropriate, for consideration on relevant definitions in existing codes and legislation and best practice. With this measure it was agreed to introduce a code of practice on victimisation. This code of practice will be applicable only in instances where the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution has been invoked or where it is intended to invoke it. This code will cover victimisation of trade union members, managers and other employees. Its drafting is the subject of ongoing discussions among the Labour Relations Commission and trade union and employer representatives.The sixth measure is the amendment of the Act to provide that the Labour Court should have regard to breaches of the anti-victimisation code and, where appropriate, should provide for redress in making its determinations. This measure provides for redress where a breach of the code of practice on victimisation has been established. The decision to provide for redress requires legislative provisions, which are included in the Bill.The seventh measure is the development of transitional provisions to permit the processing of cases in current disputes where access to the code of practice on dispute resolution as at the date of agreement is not available. This measure provides for the introduction of changes to section 2(1)(d) of the 2001 Act. The section provides one of the four existing conditions which must be complied with before the Labour Court can investigate a case.The implementation of the measures agreed in Sustaining Progress requires a revised code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution, a code of practice on victimisation and a number of amendments to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001. It is also necessary to introduce legislative provisions to provide for a prohibition on victimisation, the processing of complaints of victimisation and, where appropriate, redress.A new code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution will support the provisions of the Bill. This code of practice has been the subject of discussions among the Labour Relations Commission and trade union and employer representatives. Following these discussions, the Labour Relations Commission prepared an enhanced code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution for my consideration. I will shortly bring forward the necessary statutory instrument under section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to give effect to this code of practice.The enhanced code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution prepared by the Labour Relations Commission sets out the procedures for the effective and expeditious resolution of issues in dispute. A period of six weeks will be provided for the processing of cases under the enhanced code. It is intended that this period will provide for a two week period in which to arrange meetings and commence discussions. The remaining four weeks will be allocated to substantive engagement on the issues in dispute. An advisory officer will be appointed to facilitate proceedings. Accordingly, a dispute which has not been resolved by the Labour Relations Commission within six weeks will be deemed to have been exhausted and the advisory officer will disengage. However, in instances in which real progress is being achieved, the parties may agree a time extension during which the advisory officer will continue to work with them to achieve a resolution. The code also sets out the actions or inaction involved in determining whether a breach of the timeframe has occurred.As I said earlier, it was agreed to introduce a code of practice on victimisation. This will set out the different types of practice which will constitute victimisation arising from an employee's membership or activity on behalf of a trade union or a manager discharging his or her managerial functions or other employees.The Bill gives effect to the legislative provisions agreed in Sustaining Progress. Section 1 is a standard section in all Acts. It provides for the interpretation of certain references used later in the Bill and also permits abbreviated references to sections, subsections and other Acts.Section 2 deletes section 2(1)(b) of the 2001 Act and replaces it with a provision which allows the LRC to investigate a trade dispute if one of three different conditions has been met. These conditions are a breach of the timescales in the amended code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution, the exhaustion of the timescales in the amended code of practice or the receipt of a report from the LRC to the effect that no further efforts by it will advance the resolution of the dispute.Section 3 replaces section 3 of the 2001 Act, enabling the Labour Court to allocate its resources more efficiently by allowing it to combine preliminary and substantive hearings in a dispute referred to it under section 2(1) of the principal Act, if it considers it appropriate. This section would also have the effect of reducing the length of time taken by the Labour Court to conduct an investigation. Section 4 replaces section 10 of the 2001 Act to enable a trade union or excepted body to appeal to the Circuit Court for the enforcement of a Labour Court determination if an employer has failed to implement its terms. The Labour Court's determination is binding and is enforceable by order of the Circuit Court.Section 5 provides for the processing of cases which had been referred to the Labour Court under the principal Act at the date of enactment. These cases will be treated, from a procedural perspective, as if they had been referred to the Labour Court under the new legislation. The cases being dealt with under the 2001 Act, as well as any new cases, will benefit from the streamlined procedures contained in this Bill. Section 6 enables the Labour Court to investigate disputes where, at the date of the ratification of Sustaining Progress – 26 March 2003 – access to the Labour Court was not available due to industrial action. This section provides for the processing of cases which were precluded from the procedures of the principal Act because they did not comply with section 2(1)(d) of the Act.Section 7 enables the Labour Court to give priority to cases referred to it under this Bill, in order to enable it to resolve the dispute within the agreed time frame. Section 8 defines victimisation and allows for acts to be specified in the code of practice on victimisation to be included within the definition of victimisation. A complaint of victimisation may be made in circumstances where there is a trade dispute, in which the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution has been invoked, or is intended to be invoked, and arises from an employee's membership or activity on behalf of a trade union, a manager discharging his or her managerial functions or other employees.Section 9 deals with complaints of victimisation and empowers a rights commissioner to hear such a complaint from an employee, trade union or excepted body and to make a decision on the matter. Rights commissioners already hear complaints under 14 different Acts and two sets of regulations and are experienced and well-positioned to adjudicate on the issues involved in any cases which might be taken under this section. This section also provides that a rights commissioner may award compensation, where he or she considers it just and equitable.Section 10 provides for an appeals mechanism to the Labour Court from a decision of a rights commissioner. Section 11 empowers the Labour Court to take evidence on oath, to administer oaths and to compel a person to attend to give evidence where there is an appeal from a decision of a rights commissioner in a victimisation case, as provided for under section 10. Section 12 allows the Labour Court to refer a question of law arising in an appeal of a rights commissioner's decision under this Bill to the High Court. Also, in regard to an appeal of a rights commissioner's decision under this Bill, this section allows a party to the proceedings before the Labour Court to appeal to the High Court on a point of law only.Section 13 enables a party to apply to the Circuit Court for an enforcement order of a decision of a rights commissioner or a determination of the Labour Court in respect of a victimisation case, where the decision or determination has not been carried out within a period of six weeks. Section 14 repeals section 9 of the 2001 Act, which provides for a review of a determination by the Labour Court. As I said in regard to section 3, this amendment to the principal Act will facilitate achievement of the overall timeframe and more efficient allocation of Labour Court resources. Section 15 gives the Short Title, collective citation and construction and prescribes that the Bill shall come into operation on such day or days as may be appointed by ministerial order.The purpose of this Bill is to strengthen the procedures of the existing legislation, as agreed by the trade union and employer representatives. It provides employers and employee representatives with the opportunity to negotiate a solution to industrial disputes in situations where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place. Only if the voluntary process fails will the Labour Court become involved and, as under the principal Act, the court shall not, in its recommendations and determinations, provide for collective bargaining.I look forward to hearing the views of Members and I commend the Bill to the House.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	443	On behalf of Fine Gael, I welcome this Bill. It is an extension of and amendment to the Industrial Relations Act 2001 and it puts time limits on and gives certainty to many of the procedures and processes of the industrial relations machinery for the resolution of disputes through the various bodies and structures which have been established over the years. The Labour Court, Labour Relations Commission and other mechanisms of arbitration, which have been developed through our managing industrial relations procedures over the years, have worked well. While it might appear from the Minister of State's contribution that the process is cumbersome, the Bill will bring some speed to the resolution of many conflicts by putting time limits on those disputes in a comprehensive and collective way, which will give certainty to all protagonists. There will be a finite time in which they can exhaust all the processes at each stage of an industrial dispute.People have a right to join a trade union and there has been much debate about whether or not it should be mandatory. However, the bottom line is employment. If a company chooses, for one reason or another and with or without the agreement of its employees, that it does not wish to constitute orderly trade union representation, it should be a matter for the company involved and its employees because employment opportunities have been created for the people engaged in that work. We have a high level of trade union membership and, over the past 20 years, a major contribution has been made to social partnership by employers and employees in conjunction with the State, which has dealt with many of the economic and social issues which have bedevilled us for years.Since 1987, with the National Economic and Social Council, the partnership approach has worked exceptionally well to bring about greater economic activity, a greater realisation of the problems facing the country and a collective method of dealing with those problems. The spirit of partnership, alongside industrial relations procedures, has led us to the publication of this legislation.I acknowledge the work which has been done by employers and the ICTU in coming to agreements in order to amend the 2001 Act. We are living in a different era from that in which we lived when partnership began in the 1980s. We have achieved a great deal in terms of economic progress. There has been unsustained progress in the past six or seven years. A great deal of money was available to do the things to which many partnership agreements aspired but did not have the resources to implement. The challenge for social partnership in the years ahead is to set a new agenda of work to meet head on the great challenge of competitiveness which has been drifting in the wrong direction for the past couple of years.There were great opportunities in the past few years to implement radical major investment in the infrastructural area. Unfortunately, the Government missed that opportunity through lack of leadership, delay in bringing projects to fruition and its failure to tackle the bottlenecks in the economy. These bottlenecks are evident today from the road, rail, broadband and other infrastructural measures needed to improve our competitiveness at a time when we are coming under pressure from eastern and far eastern countries.We have reached a stage where our national competitiveness is deteriorating rapidly. The various studies carried out by the OECD or the world economic forum show that on a global basis Ireland Inc. is a far less attractive place in terms of its cost base than it was about ten years ago. We have led ourselves into a position of a higher than expected notifiable redundancy rate in the past year which could have been avoided if we tackled in a partnership manner many of the issues concerning research and development investment and infrastructural investment in our economy. We have not sustained the progress of the late 1990s and early years of this century to the extent we could and have frittered away some of the opportunities for economic development.As far back as December 2001, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were made well aware by the National Competitiveness Council of the need to improve our competitiveness. Measures which could have been implemented with the resources available at that time were drawn to the attention of both leaders. We got no leadership from them towards pushing through with the national development plan or with other measures for the economy. We are now playing catch-up relative to our partners in eastern Europe and the Far East.The national development plan is being cut back radically and I expect that the Estimates being published this week will give us further evidence of the slowdown in many smaller projects. These are important for our towns and cities and are essential for freeing up land opportunities for investment and projects which would provide sustainable investment in the future. Partnership has changed in terms of the work agenda required relative to the late 1980s. Employers and employees, because of the deterioration in our competitiveness, are being hung out to dry due to job insecurity and unnecessary market uncertainty.This Bill arises from the recent agreement, Sustaining Progress. It was expected to be published some months after the agreement was reached but we only have it in the latter part of 2003. Fine Gael will not hold up the processing of this legislation through the House, to give effect to the principles and the detail the Minister has outlined.Section 2 of the Bill introduces a new code of practice on dispute resolution which was part of the Bill in 2001. I am curious to know the level of activity on this. How many cases were taken through that process since 2001? Perhaps the Minister will indicate that in his reply. This section also deals with the code of practice which will put a time limit on dispute resolution, between six and 34 weeks. This is a reasonable length of time to come to an agreement. Some disputes are more protected than others. The high profile Pat the Baker case and other such high profile cases were, I suppose, the reason behind the initiation of the 2001 Bill. This machinery will give time limits rather than having protracted negotiations of a never-ending nature and will bring certainty to the process for those involved and concentrate their minds at an earlier stage.I welcome section 3 which provides that the preliminary and substantive issues which are part of the issue to be resolved will be dealt with in one process. This helps to speed up the process. Far too often we have seen preliminary hearings held but the substantive issues postponed for some time, perhaps to let people concentrate on the issues. The process of dealing with them at the same time will help speed up the process.Sections 5 and 6 deal with procedural backdating to 26 March. I presume that is in the context of the reaching of the national agreement between employers and employees as part of the Sustaining Progress agreement.There are some other matters on which I would like a response from the Minister. I would like to know how many cases were taken regarding the codes of practice. Could we also hear the details of the code? The Minister's speech and the legislation refer to codes. We have codes of practice, anti-victimisation codes etc., but we do not see much detail of what is involved. I am sure bullying in the workplace is one of the issues in play with the anti-victimisation code. I suppose the Minister is trying not to put it in legislative terms to give flexibility. If that is the case, could we hear the background and the details of the breaches and the nature of anti-victimisation that have arisen under this code? I want to see some clarity regarding the experience since the amendment Act of 2001, in terms of the codes of practice for resolving disputes and for anti-victimisation behaviour, before Committee Stage. I want to see in practical terms the issues which give cause to some of these disputes. I would like clarity on these vague aspects of the Bill before we reach Committee Stage.I welcome the legislation. It is the culmination of the experience of the 2001 Act which has thrown up a number of issues that need technical resolution. It will speed up the process of resolving disputes as originally intended in the 2001 Act. This is an improvement to that Act and will give clarity and early resolution to many of the problems that bedevil companies. If disputes drag on they often become more entrenched than needs be the case. Time limits to resolution of disputes will advance the best case scenario for resolution and enhance the industrial relations machinery of the companies involved and the State apparatus.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I welcome the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill. In the past 90 years or so, developed societies have progressively tried to develop and promulgate sophisticated systems of bringing about industrial peace through balancing sometimes conflicting and competing demands and requirements of labour and capital of employees and employers. By and large, Ireland has done reasonably well in developing such legislative and structural mechanisms to balance these often competing rights and to provide, in an organised and structured way, for dispute resolution systems.The Minister's contribution indicated the volume of cases being dealt with by the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, and the degree of success that those mechanisms have, even when their remit is non-binding. We have developed sophisticated systems which the social partners respect and are willing to use and which brought about a large measure of the industrial peace on which much of our recent prosperity was developed. We have, I suppose, made much of the concept of partnership as the basis of our economic success in the past two decades, in particular. We have set out the models of partnership, both at national and local levels, as ones which are almost uniquely designed to suit the needs of Ireland, and we have invited others from abroad to come to look at how those models of partnership work, both at local and national levels. I would counsel, however, that it would be wrong of us to believe that there is no room for significant improvement in labour law or in the progression of sophisticated mechanisms to ensure that partners are fully respected in the role they must play within the economy, and that we cannot learn from the experience of others in progressive law in this area.This Bill is one more incremental improvement in our law. For that reason I welcome it, although I do not wish, in the course of doing so, to overstate either its contents or significance. Although it is welcome, for all the reasons outlined by the Minister and by Deputy Hogan's initial comment, it is by and large a refinement of mechanisms that were agreed some time ago and that were first enacted in the 2001 Act, which we are focusing on amending in this legislative measure.The big issue, which is not addressed in this legislation and which I table for the first time for consideration in this debate, is that of trade union recognition. We are skirting around it in this measure and in other measures which have come before this House in international agreements to which we have been party, but we have yet to determine in a real partnership way that the issue of trade union recognition should be provided for on a statutory basis.I appreciate that this measure before us delivers on the specifics on the agreement reached with the social partners most recently called Sustaining Progress, and, in particular, deals with section 8.9 of that partnership agreement. However, section 8.1 of that agreement states:The parties to this Agreement note the ongoing debate within the European Union on the development of representation and recognition rights and the potential obligations that may be placed on Member States and on the Institutions of the EU. These are provided for in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and in various Directives relating to employee rights in respect of such matters as collective redundancies, transfer of undertakings, health and safety, information and consultation rights etc.Section 8.1 then states, I particularly emphasise the following:Notwithstanding the following, the trade unions reaffirm their continuing commitment to building on the measures outlined below and to promoting statutory trade union recognition in Ireland.Although the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill is a welcome measure because what flows in the rest of section 8 of Sustaining Progress is largely what is captured in it, the Bill meets neither the requirements set out by the trade union movement for statutory recognition of trade unions, nor, in my view, the mood of the growing international view that that is the right way to go.The Government still has not arrived at the point of accepting both the need and, probably more importantly, the value of strong trade union recognition legislation, at least not in the 29th Dáil. It is worth noting, as I have indicated and as is specifically referenced in Sustaining Progress, the contents of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.The interesting aspect of that charter is that the proposal now being referred to the Intergovernmental Conference to draft a constitution for the new Europe – the original proposal that has come about by the work, on a transnational basis across all the parliaments of Europe, endorsed by the high representatives of the Governments of Europe and submitted to the European Council meeting at Thessaloniki in June last – specifically addresses the issues which we as a Parliament have yet to address and from which we have, to this point, shied away.In the draft now under consideration for the new constitution of Europe, the Preamble to the section on fundamental rights states:Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law. It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice.The Preamble further states:To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light of changes in society, social progress and scientific and technological developments by making those rights more visible in a Charter.The charter itself is then written into the draft constitution and Article II-28 of that charter states:Workers and employers, or their respective organisations, have, in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices, the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the appropriate levels and, in cases of conflicts of interests, to take collective action to defend their interests, including strike action.It is interesting that a cross-section of the representatives of the peoples of Europe, east and west, north and south, the Parliaments and the Governments, have seen fit to include this thus far in the draft new constitution for Europe. I would be interested to hear the view of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, on these matters and, in particular, on the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference where the final text will be nuanced and presumably presented to the peoples of Europe for endorsement – in this State by way of a referendum, probably during the course of the Irish Presidency next year. Do we as a nation, and does our Government, support the fundamental charter and the right of trade union recognition envisaged in the draft constitution presented to the Thessaloniki Council and, if so, what is our difficulty in enshrining it now in our own legislation, rather than forever playing catch-up to legislation of the European Union?The momentum to proper and full recognition of trade unions is clear. In the Oireachtas, we have already enacted the Protection of Employment Act, which requires employers to inform and consult with workers and their representatives on the issue of redundancies. We will shortly have to address the requirements of the information and consultation directive, which must be transposed into Irish law by March 2005 at the latest. I have already had an initial briefing on the contents of that directive and they are far-reaching for the establishment of consultative workers' groups, and for access to information by workers into the affairs of their own companies.These are welcome and far-reaching proposals but they are inexorably pushing the requirements to have a representative structure and an organisation in place in a particular direction. New levels of dialogue will be required. There are other mechanisms and directives, including those relating to improvements to company law, that are emanating from Europe. As already stated, these are all creating an inexorable momentum in a single direction, namely, towards having the fullest possible development of real partnership between employees and employers and a requirement, on foot of the complexity of some of these matters, to have a first rate system of organisation which, by and large, can be provided by a structured, professional trade union operating in a sophisticated way.There is an old argument that trade union recognition would damage our ability to attract foreign investment, especially in the context of our competition with the United Kingdom. The Welsh and Scottish development authorities are often seen as particularly active in the same pond as Ireland in seeking foreign direct investment. It has been argued in the past that for us to enact trade union recognition legislation would place us at a disadvantage in respect of that competition with the United Kingdom. That argument no longer holds water because since 1999, the United Kingdom Industrial Relations Act has provided for trade union recognition. Ireland, in enacting such legislation now, would simply be catching up with the more progressive stance taken some years ago by the United Kingdom.The legislation to which I refer has not impacted on economic growth or job creation in the UK, for which the years since 1999 have been particularly good. It is difficult to understand, in terms of the momentum, our experience of partnership in this country or of the position in the United Kingdom, why we have shied away from dealing with the issue of trade union recognition in a comprehensive way rather than in the incrementalist way that the measure we are debating and previous legislation in this area reflect.I was interested by the Minister of State's comment that the approach of successive Governments to industrial relations has been one of voluntarism. That is an interesting concept. I am not sure what the Minister of State means by voluntarism because we have binding legislation and processes with which people are required to deal. While not all references result in binding recommendations, we have created a sophisticated legislative framework within which disputes are arbitrated and, it is hoped, ultimately resolved.I stated that we have made much of our successful social partnership model. For any such model to succeed, all parties must believe they can gain something of value from it for themselves and their members. However, in light of the number of fundamental disputes that are still ongoing about the right to associate and to be a member of a trade union and have that union recognised, it seems odd that 16 years into a process of full-blooded partnership, such a situation would continue to exist. This single, narrow issue, namely, the right to associate with and be represented by a trade union, is one in respect of which we have not moved beyond the attitudes of the 1913 lockout in Dublin or the 1911 lockout in my native Wexford. In essence, that issue was in dispute during the period to which I refer.For all our sophistication and our heralding of the issues of partnership and the fact that all the stakeholders are respected within the partnership arrangement, it is a matter of concern that this fundamental issue of trade union recognition continues to be challenged, forcefully, by some high profile companies in this State. For three years, Oxigen, a waste processing company, has refused to recognise SIPTU. If the workers in a particular company wish to be represented by a trade union, it is odd that in the 21st century, their desire could continue to be frustrated, particularly as we vaunt partnership as the road to take and everyone says that they respect the various players within the partnership process.Fundamental questions need to be asked about public policy in this area. For example, I am interested in the Government's view in respect of the awarding of public contracts. Is it the Government's view that there should be no requirement on companies that are awarded public contracts to recognise trade unions where their workers, in sufficient numbers, demand, request or require representation by a union? Does the Government have a view or a policy on that matter? If the issue of respect for partnership is real, can that be a sustainable position?I have asked for a statement of Government policy on this matter because of the concern that is being caused. Partnership is a powerful word. It clearly implies working together in a common endeavour. More than that, it requires an element of respect. If one is to be somebody's partner, one must respect him or her. However, there exists a view among a few employers – I have no wish to overstate the case – that they would prefer that trade unions did not exist. If the model for our economic resurgence states that partnership is the key and if the trade unions are respected as essential players in the development of our economic well-being and are seen as a progressive force in society, it is odd that there are people who want them to be squeezed out of existence.There are those employers that would seek to frustrate the operation of existing legislation and, I have been advised, the legislation we are debating, before it is even enacted, by seeking ways to establish different mechanisms to avoid the implications of its provisions. It seems necessary for us as a society to respect the various pillars on which we claim, assert and are proud to state that our recent prosperity was developed. Equally, if any of the pillars is undermined, our prospects of maintaining our economic well-being will be diminished.I welcome the legislation. The various sections have been carefully outlined by the Minister of State and they faithfully parallel section 8.9 of Sustaining Progress. In accepting, applauding and facilitating the early enactment of this incrementally good measure, I do not resile from the Labour Party position that respect for partnership and the right of workers to organise, which has been a bedrock of civilised society for at least a century, should be addressed faithfully and comprehensively by this Parliament at an early date. If Ireland argues internationally for the contents of the charter of fundamental rights and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs signs up to it in the name of the Government and it is acquiesced in by all Oireachtas Members, it behoves us to bring our European aspirations home and to support the enactment within our jurisdiction of progressive legislation, which respects partnership.I look forward to Committee Stage and the early enactment of the legislation but, more especially, I look forward to the speedy introduction of more significant legislation relating to trade union recognition.

Under the partnership process, the Government, IBEC and ICTU are increasingly setting the country's agenda. If, for example, the Simon Community, the National Women's Council, CORI, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or other social bodies had power in the process, legislation would be enacted within six months of an agreement to address their key wishes. However, that does not happen because they do not have a say in the negotiations or about subsequent legislation while the unions and IBEC have a massive say. The Government, through the partnership process, is running our country as an economy rather than a society. That is a flaw in the process and it is about time various parties recognised that and did something to change it.While community and voluntary bodies are ignored in the process, there is also no environmental pillar, which is a significant reason for the major environmental problems Ireland faces. As Deputy Howlin said, the legislation was taken directly from Sustaining Progress. Increasingly, IBEC, ICTU and Ministers display contempt for the House, with the direction the country will take being decided in the partnership negotiations which are not open or public and do not take into account the variety of interests in our society.Deputy Howlin referred to the case for union representation and the right set out in the European Convention, which I hope will lead to progress in that area. However, the effect of the primary legislation in the two and a half years since it was enacted should be examined. Up to May 2003, 90 cases were taken through the voluntary process to the Labour Relations Commission but only five full cases and one preliminary case have been taken to the Labour Court under the Act's provisions. Large multinational companies, among which there is a reluctance to embrace union representation, have not been involved. However, small, indigenous companies such as Jet Wash, Bantry Bay Seafoods, Noble Waste, Irish Express Cargo and Sam Hire have engaged in the process. No large multinational company, which can move from one country to another, is involved. Are we legislating on two levels whereby the Act applies to indigenous companies but not to multinational companies? We must be careful and wise to that.Ireland must also be careful in terms of striking a fine balance between maintaining the voluntary system of recognition and moving towards a legal approach. I acknowledge the benefits of union representation and, while I am critical of the partnership process, union heads have led it for the past ten years and they are responsible for much of the prosperity that has been achieved. Sacrifices by unions established the conditions for our progress. However, another reason for our success was that the partnership process was voluntary and involved the social partners working through to achieve consensus on the different elements being negotiated. There is merit in this consensus approach but I have a slight fear regarding this legislation that the unions, in trying to increase their membership by providing for time and legal constraints and opening the system to direct decisions from the Labour Court, may have provided for a move from a voluntary, consensual approach to a legal approach, which involves referral to the Labour Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court for legal opinion. I am concerned the legislation may lead us in that direction.Provision is also being made to address the issue of victimisation as well as speeding up the recognition process. It is correct and just that people who seek to achieve union status must be protected from victimisation in the workplace. This is a step in the right direction. It is difficult to envisage how it will work without the implementation of all the codes of practice and it is unfortunate all of them were not in place prior to the debate.I have two concerns regarding the legislation. The first is that the partnership process is excluding varied interests in society while it gives the groups that have power and influence the ability to form Government opinion and to have legislation enacted within six months. No other groups could achieve this and must wait for years for important legislation. The legislation they seek is not enacted because they do not have the negotiating power of IBEC and ICTU and I am not sure that is a good way to govern a country because it is not clear whether that leads to the prioritisation of legislation or investment. The process has worked because there has been a consensual arrangement.My second concern regarding the legalisation is we must be careful not to move away from that arrangement. Trade union recognition will be aided tremendously by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, to which Deputy Howlin referred, and the Green Party will support the Government in adopting and pursuing the charter if it is included in the Constitution, but the Administration should be wary of governing on the basis of what the social partners believe is right. The Government is there to take account of a wide variety of interests in society, but I believe it is not doing so.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I welcome the opportunity to address the Bill. As I have said in the House on previous occasions, the Government is anti-union. That is no surprise since it is presided over by the man responsible for the introduction of the most vicious anti-union legislation on the Statute Book, the Industrial Relations Act 1990.The Bill implements measures contained in paragraph 8.9 of part II of Sustaining Progress. I wish to make a number of points regarding Sustaining Progress and the social partnership process. Social partnership has represented an attempt by the Government to co-opt those who have been most marginalised. This is especially evident from the inclusion of the community and voluntary pillar. Despite a failure to deliver on demands made by the community and voluntary sectors, their inclusion in the partnership process is being used by the Government to give the appearance of consultation and consensus.The Government and employers' organisations are making workers bargain for rights which are rightfully theirs as part of the wider social partnership deal. These are not concessions. Employer recognition of unions, compliance with labour legislation and fulfilling statutory redundancy rights are all basic workplace rights. These should not even be on the negotiating table.Although Sinn Féin will not oppose the Bill, we are disappointed that this opportunity was not used to enhance the rights of workers. Mandate, which rejected the Sustaining Progress agreement, described the measures contained in the agreement on industrial relations as: "simply an exercise in tinkering around the edges of the existing voluntary code of practice which does not represent any form of meaningful change".There are major problems with industrial relations legislation in this State, especially with certain provisions contained in the Industrial Relations Act 1990 which were designed to crack down on union activity, including section 9 of that Act which makes it almost impossible to take action in defence of an individual worker and the provisions in section 12 of the Act of 1990 which deal with "blacking". These measures especially hit workers employed by anti-union employers and who are fighting for union recognition.We have seen a stark example in Dublin of the problems to which this State's anti-union industrial relations legislation can give rise. As already referred to by a previous speaker. Oxigen, a private company contracted by local authorities in Dublin to collect waste, refuses to allow SIPTU to organise and to allow its workers to be represented by their union. The failure of the Government to oblige all companies operating in Ireland to recognise by law the unions organised in their companies is an ongoing disgrace. I congratulate the SIPTU workers who took part in industrial action in solidarity with their fellow workers in Oxigen.Sinn Féin supports the use of the sympathetic strike, which has a long and honourable history in the trade union movement. As the old trade unionist saying has it, an injury to one of us is an injury to all of us. The struggle for union recognition is one in which every member of the trade union movement is involved and which they should support.In the Oxigen case, a number of extremely serious allegations have been made against the company's practices. Workers claim that employees born outside Ireland are threatened with losing their work permits if they join the union. The company has repeatedly refused to attend the Labour Relations Commission. If only half the allegations of threats, physical intimidation and unsafe work practices carried out by Oxigen in this dispute are true, the company is truly fighting in a dirty manner and SIPTU workers are to be congratulated for standing up to it.Laws which permit such behaviour are hardly progressive and should be changed immediately. Public contracts should not be awarded to any company which refuses to recognise the trade union movement. This problem would not exist if companies were forced to recognise and deal with unions organised in those companies.Trade union recognition was also the issue in the Ryanair dispute when baggage handlers were locked out of their jobs for demanding to be represented by SIPTU and Michael O'Leary shipped in scab labour to keep his planes flying. He refused point blank, as Oxigen has done, to avail of industrial relations mechanisms to resolve the dispute. Sympathetic industrial action was also taken in this dispute by other workers willing to stand with their comrades in Ryanair.The failure of the so-called social partnership process to deliver mandatory union recognition exposes the failure of the process to deliver for workers. It also exposes the fact that the Government's industrial policy is written by IBEC, approved by the Progressive Democrats and rubber-stamped by Fianna Fáil Deputies, some of whom have union cards in their back pockets and should be ashamed of their failure to stand up for the trade union movement.It is not popular to defend the rights of trade unions to take industrial action. Anyone who remembers the media-led campaign of hate and vilification a number of years ago against Brendan Ogle, a decent man, knows that the Irish media establishment tends to side with management and against workers at every opportunity. Industrial relations legislation in this country has hamstrung the ability of the Irish trade union movement to mobilise and fight on behalf of its workers.Sustaining Progress does nothing for the disadvantaged and the low-paid. Those organisations who work with the most disadvantaged in our society have consequently rejected the deal, seeing it for what it is – nothing more than a pay deal on which some, such as Fine Gael, would encourage the Government to renege. Sustaining Progress has been rejected by the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Simon Community of Ireland, the National Women's Council of Ireland and the Community Workers Co-operative. This vague document commits no new resources to addressing poverty and social exclusion. How can the Government continue to call this social partnership? Where are the specifics?The Simon Community rejected Sustaining Progress on the basis that it does nothing for the homeless and contains no meaningful commitments for people who are living in poverty. The 10,000 houses committed in the agreement will not be targeted at those most in need of housing. The Minister with responsibility for housing has suggested that the method by which people will acquire houses under this scheme will involve a lottery. Perhaps he envisages a system similar to "Telly Bingo" on a Saturday night.So-called social partnership is being used to facilitate the privatisation of essential services in this State. Privatisation of public utilities is central to the right-wing ideology of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. It is also notable that privatisation has been a feature of the period since the adoption of the social partnership model of industrial relations. The dismantling of core public services such as CIE, Aer Rianta and refuse collection services throughout the State will take years to reverse. The sooner we halt this process the better. Although Sinn Féin supports the Bill, we believe the State has a long way to go in terms of real rights for workers and trade unionists.

Commitments in Sustaining Progress with reference to the effectiveness of procedures for dispute resolution and processing claims have made this legislation necessary. Social partnership has been the essential ingredient in the success of previous agreements such as the Programme for National Recovery in 1987, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress from 1990, Partnership 2000 from 1997 to 2000, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness from 2000 to 2003 and, at present, Sustaining Progress which will expire in 2005.Such programmes have played no small role in the transformation of every sector of the economy from the bleak prospects of the mid-1980s to the current state of the post-tiger economy, which is still comparatively healthy. However, in the course of the negotiations between the social partners, leading to the adoption of Sustaining Progress, the trade union negotiators sought significant amendments to the previous industrial relations Act, including mandatory trade union recognition. The Bill would incorporate some improvements, but the key demand of the trade unions to have the legal right to represent members where they choose has still not been met.This right has still not been addressed in the new Bill and is still an essential trade union demand. Although the Bill is an improvement on what has gone before, it fails to meet the concerns of trade union members regarding recognition of their union and their right to choose to be represented by a trade union. The legislation has improved to the extent that it removes opportunities for employers to frustrate the process because there are very tight timeframes involved. If employers are not using the process meaningfully, trade unions will be able to call a halt and proceed directly to the Labour Court for a determination of their grievance. In the event of a dispute being referred to the Labour Relations Commission and the LRC advising the Labour Court of its inability to achieve a resolution of the particular dispute, the trade union may refer the dispute to the Circuit Court.It is still a fact in Irish industrial relations that about 70% of companies in the private sector are not unionised, particularly in the high-tech sector, where workers do not have the right to be represented by a trade union. Some of those companies have an anti-union ethos but others do not come under pressure to unionise their employees and much of this is down to fair-weather workers. When conditions are fine, bonuses are awarded and wage packets are full, they are happy enough to contribute nothing to a trade union, but they are the first people to run to a trade union if there is a danger of redundancy. It is not always the company's fault that a workforce is not unionised, although some of them have an anti-union ethos.Public authority money is being doled out to companies which do not recognise unions, and Deputies Howlin and Morgan mentioned some of those companies. Companies do not want to allow unions in because they then have to give workers their full rights and entitlements. It is one of the legacies of the Celtic tiger era that the level of unionisation has diminished in inverse proportion to the growth of these high-tech companies, in some of which a minimal degree of union recognition is permitted.One issue raised by the Bill is what constitutes collective bargaining and who decides if collective bargaining has taken place. The Bill includes a provision permitting trade unions to process claims on behalf of their members when collective bargaining does not take place but the Bill lacks some understanding of what collective bargaining means. Trade unions are not seeking a definition of collective bargaining to be incorporated in the Bill as this would cause considerable constitutional problems in relation to freedom of association, disassociation etc. Rather than having a definition of collective bargaining in the Bill, trade unions want the Labour Court to have the authority to make the final decision regarding whether collective bargaining would take place.It frequently happens that an employer who wants no truck with unions will arrange his own version of collective bargaining with a two-bit collection of his own lackeys by bringing them out to dinner and buying them a few pints afterwards. He knows he will have them again for their next set of talks when they may negotiate about the colour of the wall, whether it needs a coat of paint or what colour that should be. That is their interpretation of collective bargaining.It is vitally important to avoid a situation where this type of arrangement could be represented as collective bargaining. Trade unions require a situation where the Labour Court can determine if collective bargaining can take place, as it is the competent body to so decide. It is like the elephant test, one knows an elephant when one sees it and the Labour Court would recognise collective bargaining if it sees it. Rather than having a definition of collective bargaining, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of how it is decided whether collective bargaining takes place. The Minister should give this matter serious consideration and address these concerns with amendments to the Bill.There is also no definition included in the Bill of an "employee", despite the fact that it mentions "employee" several times. Normally in industrial relations the term used to describe an employee is "worker", which has been the case with previous legislation, but there is also the need to define what exactly is a "worker". Trade unions would say that "employee" means "worker", and an employee should be defined in the same terms as a worker in other legislation. An "employee" has previously never been defined anywhere, and this represents a new concept in law since that term has not been used anywhere else.I will now move on to the better part of the curate's egg. I compliment the Minister on his foresight in including a provision to protect people from being victimised, which is an extremely important part of the legislation, and I support his initiative in providing a very strong definition of victimisation that includes instances of bullying, harassment and employers leaning on people who seek to promote unions in the workplace. Other welcome aspects of the Bill are the provision that the LRC develop a code of practice on victimisation and the specific provisions to ban outright the victimisation of employees in certain circumstances.The Bill also provides that where a trade union intends to refer or has referred a dispute to the Labour Court, no employee may be victimised on account of his or her membership or otherwise of a trade union or any union activity. There is also provision for a complaint of victimisation to be made to a rights commissioner up to six months after the alleged incidents. The rights commissioner may investigate and issue a determination, awarding up to two years' remuneration as compensation.The section of the Bill on victimisation represents a major advance in industrial relations terms. However, the Bill fails to adequately address the fundamental and constitutional right of a person to be represented by a trade union, which is regrettable.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	450	This Bill owes its provenance to commitments made in the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the latest agreement in a line going back to the Programme for National Recovery  in 1987. The overwhelming majority of people concur that this series of partnership agreements has made a massive contribution to our economic and social development since then. The international downturn, which shows signs of ending, may have constrained our progress in recent years, but when we consider the mass emigration prevalent in 1987, the Self Aid concerts and the dole queues which were only matched by the queues for green cards, we can safely say that partnership has served us well and we continue to reap the benefits today.We need to remind ourselves of the overall industrial harmony which has persisted since 1987. With the passage of time, there are people who do not remember that an industrial accord was one of the pillars on which our progress was built. By concentrating on partnership and avoiding the appalling, dogmatic politics that characterised the United Kingdom in the 1980s, we brought all the sectors of our society forward together, and sterile ideology, spuriously disguised as conviction, was rejected by the Irish people. Partnership and consensus were the way forward.The whole partnership process has been particularly associated with the Taoiseach. As Minister for Labour from 1987 to 1991 we can safely say that no other Minister made such a valuable contribution to industrial harmony. He became synonymous with the consensus approach that sought to heal differences and bring people forward together in a constructive manner.

#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	452	A Bill on industrial relations affords us the opportunity to consider the broader aspect of employer-employee relations and take an overview on the state of play. The issue of industrial relations has been in the news recently. The number of working days lost in the first two quarters of this year exceeded by 50% the number of working days lost in the whole of last year. Admittedly, 2002 was an exceptionally good year in terms of industrial relations. CSO figures on working days lost going back to 1995 indicate that 2002 was the best of those eight years and it may have been a 30 year low in that regard. Incredibly, we lost ten times as many working days in 1999 as we did in 2002. Industrial action in the public sector was the principal cause of working days lost thus far in 2003 with the public health doctors and clerical staff in the Department of Agriculture and Food making up the bulk of the 32,000 days lost.It appears that more than 80% of disputes in recent years were in the public sector. The reaction of the social partners to these developments was interesting, with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, concentrating on industrial peace within the private sector, saying that this demonstrated how the partnership approach between employer and employee was effective. IBEC concentrated on the public sector saying that the figures from the Central Statistics Office were disappointing.The public sector has always been the focus of much comment because of benchmarking in recent months. I was glad to note that the Minister for Finance and the public service made it explicit in discussions with the social partners that payment of benchmarking awards was contingent not only on public service modernisation but on the commitments in the agreement to industrial relations peace and stability. All the previous partnership agreements contained industrial peace clauses but the provisions in Sustaining Progress were reinforced and underlined to a much greater extent than previously. Everybody involved knows that industrial relations stability is an essential requirement and must be delivered. This is for what the Government and the public sector unions signed up. Whatever about difficulties in measuring the achievement of modernisation targets, there is no difficulty in establishing whether a "no industrial action" target has been met. The Minister referred to the system of industrial relations in Ireland as being essentially voluntary in nature.The Government has always shared the consensus with the social partners that the terms and conditions of employment of workers are best determined through voluntary bargaining procedures between employers and employees. Clearly, this attitude to industrial relations has served us well. The reluctance of the Government and law makers to indulge in a temptation to impose solutions is to be welcomed. It is a good practice that we continue, in so far as possible, to facilitate and provide solid foundations for conflict resolution. In 2002, a year in which the number of industrial disputes, as recorded by the Central Statistics Office, and the number of days lost to disputes hit a 30 year low, referrals to the Labour Court nevertheless increased by 6% as compared to the previous year. Since 2000, total referrals to the Labour Court have increased by more than 20%. The court completed 13% more cases in 2002 than in 2001. Public sector organisations, especially in the health and transport sectors, accounted for more than a quarter of industrial relations cases completed during the year.In his foreword to the Labour Court 2002 annual report, the chairman of the court, Mr. Finbarr Flood, referred to the re-emergence of the revolving door phenomenon. This occurs where parties in dispute fail to acknowledge the role of the court as court of last resort and use it as a staging post rather than the last step in the dispute resolution process. The court, on many occasions, has expressed its concern, which I share, that this practice damages the operation of the industrial relations procedures generally.This is the background against which we must examine this Bill. This is not the first employee related legislation to come out of Sustaining Progress. Earlier this year the Redundancy Payments Act provided for a doubling and, in some cases, a quadrupling of statutory entitlements in this area. The Government and the Tánaiste are to be congratulated on the speedy dispatch of that legislation. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who is piloting this legislation through the House has also acted to give equal rights to fixed contract workers.This legislation is not high profile. Its publication in July did not stir any leader writers to great heights. It appears to have received scant attention among the media. It is possible, given the inclination of the media to focus on bad news, that this is a positive development. The absence of major industrial disputes means that this Bill, one of the motivations of which is to enhance existing dispute resolution measures, is unlikely to generate much coverage, yet this is another significant Bill and the relative unanimity we can expect in this House should not diminish from the fact that it is more evidence of the success of the partnership process.The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 and the Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution instigated a new system more than two years ago to resolve issues in disputes where there were no existing arrangements for collective bargaining. However, there has been a considerable degree of dissatisfaction and irritation with these measures due to the lack of a timeframe for dispute resolution within the existing code of practice. There is also frustration that to refer a dispute to the Labour Court, the onus is placed on a union or excepted body to show that the employer had failed to act in good faith.There is discontent at the length of time taken to process cases through the Labour Court before obtaining legally enforceable Circuit Court orders. Accordingly, this new legislation will enable the Labour Court to examine cases where the specific timeframe, to be set out in the new code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution, has been exceeded. It will also enable the Labour Court to act when the Labour Relations Commission has signalled that no further work on its part will assist settlement of the dispute. To facilitate this, the Labour Court will be able to link preliminary hearings and substantive hearings where it considers it the correct procedure.The Bill will put in place further intermediary arrangements to deal with the processing of cases, which at the date of enactment are referred to the Labour Court. It also enables procedures for the Labour Court to investigate a dispute where access to the court was not obtainable because of industrial action at, or before, the ratification of the latest partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress.Once the Labour Court has made a judgment, this legislation will allow a trade union or accepted body to apply to the Circuit Court to ensure that such a judgment is enforced. The waiting period of at least three months and the review of the determination by the Labour Court will no longer be applicable.I welcome the provision in the Bill that forbids any victimisation of employees arising from membership, or activity on behalf, of a trade union, a manager discharging his or her managerial functions, or from disputes relating to trade union recognition. The Bill also puts in place procedures for hearing complaints of victimisation and these are to be welcomed.We all accept that common sense must prevail. No one will dispute that social partnership has been, is and will always be successful. In a modern economy, it is only proper that people sit down together to air their differences and come to a consensus. One never gets everything one wants in life. One has to take into consideration other outlooks and ideas. Together, we must all work for the betterment of our fellow citizens and the good of the country. We are a great country and to remain so, we should maintain social partnership and move forward to take our place among the nations of the world.I welcome the Bill and I commend the social partners for agreeing to its provisions.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I welcome the Bill. Although, as Deputy Kelly, said it is not earth-shattering, it is important. One of the centrepieces in our economic progress over the past nine years is in the inflow of industrial funds into the economy. Over recent years, the number of days lost through strikes has been relatively low. The year 2002 was a particularly good one, though this year will not be nearly as good. However, the overall pattern has been going in the right direction. This is due to the social partnership agreements of recent years. There has to be a level of trust and civility between workers and management. At the basic levels of industrial relations – in factories or other services – if there is not a degree of good sense and trust, no matter how the national pattern stands, one will have problems of bitterness and prejudice. However, I hope we are getting over this in our economy. What the Minister of State has introduced in this legislation is another way of fine-tuning to ensure that when workforces have real or perceived problems, they will have the opportunity to put them right.I accept the concept of partnership. Whether it is as good as some people say, it is certainly better than the alternative that others propose in breaking it up. We have IBEC and the unions on opposite sides with the various pillars in between. It is designed to ensure that all facets of society are connected to the negotiating table in some way, maybe not in the first league, but in the second.However, I have a bee in my bonnet about one aspect of the partnership arrangement. I cannot understand why one half of this House is disenfranchised in the negotiations. The Opposition has no say whatsoever in the national partnership agreements, yet the Opposition, regardless of party, is always directly elected by the people. I cannot understand why there is no mechanism to include the combined Opposition in the negotiations given that every other sector of society gets the chance. If there is a good reason for it, I have never seen it. It has never been adequately explained to me as to why this is the case. Naturally, in the negotiations there are the unions, employers, the Government, the social pillars and the farming community. However, the Opposition is not included and has no direct input, unless through debate in the House which is not real negotiation. Some day, someone might explain why this is the case.I listened to Deputy Howlin's contribution to the debate, particularly on union recognition. I cannot say I am an expert in this field. However, in my experience of dealing with the limited number of disputes there have been in my constituency of Galway East during my time in the House, it seems to make sense to have well organised union representation together with a management that understands how the system works. In many instances it means that there is a better prospect of making progress than if the workers are not unionised.However, I have had dealings with a number of overseas companies which for various reasons do not want a unionised workforce. I find it difficult to accept that the Government would place a statutory obligation on a company like that, especially given that a huge number of the workers themselves do not want it. It would be different if the entire workforce wanted it. In such cases, the jobs created and revenue generated in the area the factory was located would come down to a question between the workers and the management and I could not see a role for the Government at that level as it could not be policed. If they believed they would be obliged to have a unionised workforce against their will, many overseas enterprises would go to a part of the world without such obligation. On the other hand, there is obviously considerable room for manipulation, victimisation, etc. in places of work that are not unionised.I often marvel at the amount of time and interest ordinary shop stewards put into their work. Theirs is not exactly an exciting position to hold. Their role goes almost unnoticed. They are always at the butt end of every problem. Much of the time even their own workers do not like them. They certainly filter much of the trouble that could become significant and eventually go to the Labour Court. They do much of that locally. Their contribution is well noted. They are an integral part of the system and perform a great duty. We should not forget that.I hear nothing but the highest praise for the Labour Relations Commission. It is not so much its public profile, but its ability to intervene on the basis that, following contact having been made by either side, one of its officers can have serious negotiations that are not binding on either party and that either can simply fall away as if it had never happened. I know of several would-be strikes that were avoided because of that system.I can understand why the Minister said there were more than 2,000 meetings chaired by the Labour Relations Commission last year. This represents 40 meetings per week, which is a huge number for a population of our size. As a first point of contact the Labour Relations Commission is extremely important. All the human resource managers and trade unionists I know have great time for the credibility of the commission. It is seen as an honest broker. As long as it can maintain that ethos and image, the business of labour relations is in good hands. The Minister stated that more than 600 cases were handled in the Labour Court. Despite the fact that the outcomes were not binding on either party, between 70% and 80% had favourable results.This Bill fine-tunes the 2001 Act. While I can understand how many of the procedures the Minister outlined could be very useful, I will not speak about them because I do not pretend to know their technical aspects. Ultimately it is worth having something that will speed up the process and be seen to give both parties a fair crack of the whip and, most importantly, to balance the cooling-off period which is hugely important when both sides are at loggerheads.When a potential strike arises people react entirely differently than normal. It is important to accept that people will say and do things they would not normally dream of saying or doing in the heat of the moment. It is a bit like a general election among politicians. Against that background it is important to have cool heads, clearly defined procedures that can be trusted and credibility. While the system proposed in the Bill will not solve all the problems, it will go a long way towards addressing many of them. It is good to see that this has been agreed by all the stakeholders involved, which probably explains why there is no great media interest in the Bill.The legislation deals with victimisation. When summing up, will the Minister indicate how this part of the Bill ties in with the Equality Authority whose remit also covers victimisation? The authority states that it is unlawful to penalise an employee for taking action pursued through the enforcement of the legislation, for example, by referring an equality claim or giving evidence in proceedings under equality legislation. Is there a connection between this and the Bill as there appears to be some overlap? I understand the intention of the Bill. No employee or manager should be victimised for bringing a claim or doing something a company does not like. I do not know how this will be policed. While I imagine the definition of victimisation is very broad, I assume it is not much broader than the Minister outlined in his opening statement. Will the Minister of State indicate when he is summing up how this links in with the Equality Authority? This encompasses a huge area, as seen from the results of various court cases.I assume that "victimisation" in this legislation encompasses bullying in the workforce. This is another major problem. During my many years as a TD, no one ever came to me about bullying in the workforce until relatively recently. Over the past two or three years, however, I have met a substantial number of people who perceived that they were being bullied at work. I am not a professional in this area, but it is significant that, for many people, even those who spend many years in the same employment because they have no alternative, it is sheer hell. I do not know whether this can be legislated for, but a Minister who does something about it will make a real contribution. The anxiety, fear and pressure that bullying in the workforce brings on people is not generally realised. The strange aspect is that many of those who come to me regarding their experiences are not meek. Some of them are in middle management. It is hugely important that the legislation has something to say on the issue.There are disputes that amaze me. There was one in the Department of Agriculture and Food earlier this year and I could never understand how it began. It involved district veterinary officers, but not throughout the country. That was unusual. If I recall correctly, only three or four were in dispute. It played havoc, certainly with County Galway, and continues to do so. One hopes that, for their part, unions can bring some pressure to bear to ensure that, if a strike is pending, it should be widespread. One of the aspects of the strike to which I referred was that, had it been a national dispute from day one, it would have been solved much more quickly. It was more difficult to solve because it was regional in scope. I assume the union had great trouble with it. The farming community suffered greatly as a result. I hope that type of contingency is covered in the Bill.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I welcome the Bill. It is timely and sensible and I am sure it will draw support from all sides of the House. The role of the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission have been crucial in maintaining the social partnership model. Dispute resolution has been the cornerstone by which Ireland has avoided the painful and economically damaging strikes that were the hallmark of the 1980s. My party has a particular interest in the fact that it has also been the mechanism through which a degree of social justice has been achieved. At times of high economic growth, it is often forgotten that people are behind the economic statistics, and the need to balance the economic progress with industrial peace must always be stressed. Any extension of the Labour Court's dispute settling powers can only be welcomed by both trade unions and business.My party has been critical of late of certain aspects of the social partnership model. Next year, benchmarking awards will cost the State over €1 billion, which will not result in an improvement in frontline services. It will not mean an extra hospital bed, teacher or garda. With the publication of Estimates tomorrow, that €1 billion will mean stealth taxes and local government charges that will hit the poorest citizens. It will mean services will not only be restricted but cut back. Throughout the debate on benchmarking, Fine Gael made the point that it was not primarily the salary scale that was disaffecting civil and public servants but the lack of meritocracy and reward for initiative, the stultifying focus on seniority instead of talent and the grinding inability of the structures to change.Pay scales in the civil and public service need to be brought up to scratch, but only against the backdrop of a changed and invigorated public service. Throwing money at the problem of frustrated, unrecognised and unrewarded State workers is no solution. Anyone working in the dispute resolution process would agree with this because it is there that the lack of proper mechanisms to reward and respect workers and the subsequent frustration that can flow is displayed. It is there that managers vent their frustration with the workforce they feel is not pulling its weight. Leaving aside the merits of these arguments, we can surely learn that the need for a thought-out, nuanced approach to industrial relations is the way forward.The Bill deals with those outside social partnership. It is good to be reminded that many workers are not covered by Sustaining Progress and, when faced with industrial problems, must make their own way through the jungle of employer-employee relations. The Bill will cut through that jungle and is a tribute to those who drafted it, if only for this reason.This Bill is for those who have been left behind. It is for the mechanic who works in a small garage or the secretary who works in a small or medium-sized enterprise. Ultimately, it is for those who would never go on strike or who, up to now, would never have dreamed of tackling a real or perceived problem in the workplace. My party welcomes the establishment of the two new codes of practice which will smooth the path to industrial peace and benefit both sides in a dispute. The Bill is good law and I look forward to its completion and passage through the Oireachtas.There is a growing section of the workforce, however, that the Bill will not help, namely, immigrant workers. I have stressed this repeatedly. They will not use these mechanisms because of the fear of losing their jobs and, as a consequence, the right to work in this country.The current work permit scheme unjustly ties the migrant worker to one employer. Work permit holders do not enjoy the flexibility to change jobs within their employment sector and thus cannot move from one employer to another, should they choose to do so. This is an unfair system which makes the employee over-reliant on the employer. It means they cannot be more selective about issues such as pay and general working conditions.The current work permit system allows unscrupulous employers opportunities to abuse procedures and hire cheap labour to work in often scandalous conditions. These have included illegal deductions from wages, being expected to work outside the terms of the original contract and for longer hours than stipulated in their terms of employment. For them the work permit system has failed.The scheme adds to the behind-closed-doors nature of the work. Their employers apply for and hold their permits, creating an imbalance and a potentially explosive relationship between employer and employee. The situation faced by work permit holders contrasts extremely negatively with the superior rights enjoyed by those who hold work visas. They have the right to change jobs within their profession. The imbalance between the rights of work permit holders and their work visa counterparts needs to be clearly assessed and, if necessary, altered to ensure a fairer system for migrant workers.Legislation is also required to state more clearly the mutual rights and obligations that exist between employers and non-national workers. Many migrant workers remain unclear as to their legal entitlements and rights. Once such rights and obligations are clearly defined, both parties will be aware of their rights and protections will become more enshrined, thus reducing the threat of exploitation. It is only in these circumstances that work permit holders will avail of the provisions in the Bill to protect their rights and improve their working conditions. It is only when this change is made that the Bill will benefit the entire workforce.

It has taken almost seven years, since the 1997 general election when some vague commitments were made by the Taoiseach in regard to trade union recognition, to get to this stage via the welcome code of practice in 2000 and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2001. We are inching closer to having the type of rights-based system, in terms of trade union representation, which most people would regard as a hallmark of a modern democracy.I congratulate the leadership of the trade union movement, in particular Mr. Jack O'Connor, president, and Mr. Joe O'Flynn of SIPTU and the general secretary of the Communications Workers Union, Mr. Con Scanlon, who, like the others to whom I referred, has a long-standing and profound interest in the mechanisms whereby trade union recognition can be made a basic right for every worker in the State. Many other trade union leaders such as Mr. Peter McLoone of IMPACT, among others, also contributed over the years towards this debate.I received strong support from their predecessors in the trade union movement in 1998 when I introduced a comprehensive trade union recognition Bill on behalf of the Labour Party. It was, unfortunately, rejected by the Minister, Deputy Harney, and defeated by the Government parties. I received important advice at that time from Mr. Jimmy Sommers and Mr. John McDonnell of SIPTU, in particular, and also from Mr. Brendan Hayes of SIPTU who is still a senior official. Mr. David Begg of ICTU has also had a long-standing and deep interest in this matter.I welcome the fact that we have reached an advanced position on the type of rights that all workers should have. I commend the Minister in particular—

The Bill has had a long gestation period. It builds on the 2001 Act and the regulations from 2000. In particular, I welcome the changes to the time conditions the Minister is bringing forward on how a matter can be processed before the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. I also welcome sections 8 and 9 regarding victimisation. Brave workers in so many companies in the private sector who have had the courage, integrity and determination to try to establish a trade union branch to professionally represent them have in many instances been viciously victimised and discriminated against. It is important that at last we have a mechanism which will recognise this.As I said to the Taoiseach yesterday, while we sit on these comfortable benches, there are still many examples of where the basic right of professional representation by trade union officials is denied to workers. I called his attention to an example in my constituency of the Oxigen waste management company at Clonshaugh, Dublin 17, where over the past four weeks senior workers have been demonstrating outside that plant because they are denied the fundamental right to belong to a trade union.I understand that, when the recent reorganisation of waste management took place in Dublin City Council and the other county councils in the Dublin region, it was agreed that the contracts which would be given to new sub-contractors – in this case for a green waste disposal system mainly for newspapers, cardboard and tins – would be awarded only to companies that recognised trade unions and were prepared to allow professional representation to their workers. The Dublin city manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, Fingal county manager, Mr. Willie Soffe, and others have broken that solemn commitment. They are doing business with a blatantly anti-trade union company, which is what the Oxigen company is.Non-national workers are brought in to run a service under conditions and wage rates that Irish workers would not tolerate.

I said it outside the House. The Oxigen company will not allow professional trade union representation. Every worker in this House and in the public service is allowed to have professional trade union representation, but this is denied to these waste management workers. This is disgraceful and appalling and must be resisted. Each one of us and executives from Mr. Michael O'Leary of Ryanair to the head of management of the Oxigen company has access to professional representation when he or she negotiates his or her salary and conditions, but these same people deny basic professional representation to ordinary workers. This is an undemocratic outrage. It is unconstitutional and should be ended. I have no hesitation in naming this company in the House. I am proud to do so.These workers, a delegation from whom I met last Saturday, carry out a vital job. They were involved in the collection of newspapers and other waste material for recycling, which is a fundamental objective of the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. Many of these employees were senior members of staff who had previously worked in companies where trade unions were active and thought it was obvious that they would join the SIPTU trade union to gain representation. For their troubles they ended up being dismissed and are now walking the streets in protest. It is essential that this does not happen again.I commend the Minister of State and the Government for getting us to this stage. I hope the Bill marks the first step on the way to cutting out the type of behaviour to which I referred. The provisions in the Bill will make illegal some of what has happened in Oxigen. A fundamental point is that everybody, from Deputies and Senators down to every worker, deserves the most professional representation in terms of their wages and conditions.

I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, on the detailed speech he made to the House last night. He outlined in detail the reason the constitutional amendment which has been suggested by Deputy Morgan is not acceptable to the Government. He also detailed the wide-ranging measures on the Statute Book which govern social housing.The Housing Acts 1966 to 2002 are comprehensive. They establish the parameters within which Government and local authorities must make provision for housing. It is heartening for those of us who have been involved in public life for some time to see the great progress which has been made over the past number of years in local authority housing programmes. Particularly heartening has been the extent to which the programmes have been rolled out around the country and the welcome improvement of the quality of the housing provided. It is evident to everyone who travels around the country that local authorities are providing top-quality houses. It is also heartening for those of us representing predominantly rural constituencies that housing schemes are being constructed in our smaller towns and villages which would have had no hope of being provided with such schemes in the past. If there is any social or rural regeneration measure which can contribute handsomely to rural development, it is the provision of housing. As we all know, with additional families comes extra demand for school places. Larger populations are socially and economically important to rural areas, villages and small towns.I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and his predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on the great work they have done on the environment and in the provision of housing. For the eighth successive year, 2002 will see the highest ever output of housing. It is very welcome that some 60,000 housing units will be completed. This is obvious progress.

It is delivering quality housing to all parts of this country. It is not simply that houses are being built, but that they are being built at an unprecedented rate and are of unprecedented quality. I hope Opposition Deputies recognise that fact. The quality and the quantity of housing is unprecedented in the history of the State. I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will continue in Government to implement the successful housing policies of the past few years.I would like to see the streamlining of the disabled person's grant scheme and the essential repairs grant scheme. Not alone do we need to build additional houses and increase the housing stock, we should also protect and improve some of the existing housing.

I am certainly not doing so. The 7,155 people who sent me to the Dáil from Dublin South-West do not want me to stand here and say there is not a problem. My role as a Government backbencher is to bring reality to these debates and to acknowledge it. However, as Deputy Brendan Smith has said, significant efforts are being made by the Government which I compliment.We all have to engage in politics and make party political broadcasts every now and again, but we are all trying to achieve the same goal. We are trying to create a situation where families have their own housing and people are allowed to live in peace without community problems arising from anti-social behaviour and rented housing. These are the issues we deal with all day, every day and this Bill provides us with an opportunity to debate them.I listened carefully to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, last night. While not every Member agreed with what he said, in a rather excellent address he outlined the actions the Government is taking. Our role in this debate is to highlight that fact, while being brave enough to acknowledge the problem which exists.

I am not doing that. I have already complimented Deputy Morgan and his colleagues for tabling this business and I did that genuinely. I am not saying it to get my name noticed. Where efforts have been made to highlight the problems we all have, they should be acknowledged.I am not afraid to come to this House and admit there are housing problems. We need to deal with housing. I recall that when I was first married, my priority was to get a house. I now see my children being unable to do that. There is something wrong with society when these problems exist. Our role is to assist the process and to support the Government. I am not afraid to do that. I suspect that if I were sitting on the far benches, though I do not know if I will ever have that opportunity—

I have said it about health and housing. Good policies are being brought forward and the Government is making a genuine effort to tackle the problem. If Deputies wish me to use the term "crisis", I will do so, however, we should support the Government rather than oppose it for opposition sake. The people I meet in clinics and on the street in Tallaght who raise these issues do not want us to engage in petty politics, although we have to do so some of the time. However, we must be reasonable and support the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his Department in their work. It is important we have this debate and continue to fight for more housing for young families, as well as the thousands of people who call South Dublin County Council every day looking for housing. This debate is about supporting such people and I look forward to exercising my right at 8.30 p.m.
#TomMcEllistrimFF	unknown-#TomMcEllistrimFF-party	unknown-#TomMcEllistrimFF-dob	unknown-#TomMcEllistrimFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill, since housing is one of the most basic social needs. The basic aim of the State's housing policy is to enable every household to have an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice. I support the Government's view that it would be inappropriate to include a legal right to housing in the Constitution on the basis that funding commitments to the various housing programmes are leading to increased outputs and that decisions in regard to the allocation of financial resources are a matter for the democratically accountable Government rather than the courts.This concurs with the 1996 report of the constitutional review group, which concluded that the Constitution should not confer personal rights to freedom from property or to other economic or social entitlements. Political matters should be the responsibility of elected Members to address and determine in a democracy. The Government's achievements in the area of housing are demonstrated by its success in increasing housing supply and reflected in the eighth year in a row of a record house completion achieved last year. It is a Government priority to ensure that output responds to projected housing demands.Activity under the social and affordable and shared ownership schemes has played an increasing role in assisting low income households to purchase their own homes. The shared ownership scheme has also benefited a significant number of households since it came into being. The target of 2,000 units under the national development plan for both of these schemes should be met, which is important for the target groups in this area of concern. Kerry County Council has provided affordable housing for sale in Firies and Killarney. The demand for these houses highlights the significant affordability gap in the housing market, with the increasing cost of housing, particularly in the larger towns. The provision of low cost sites in Abbeydorney, Firies and Cahirciveen is important for people in small towns and villages in rural Ireland.Accommodation for Travellers has become an important issue in recent years and will be a specific objective of Kerry County Council, of which I am a member, for the next six months at least. I am also a member of the SPC on the housing committee. Work is ongoing on the implementation of the Traveller accommodation programme 2000-04. In conjunction with the local Traveller accommodation consultative committee, a Traveller liaison officer has been appointed to assist members of the Traveller community to address their housing needs and problems. There are currently more than 200 families in local authority houses in Kerry and a further 24 families in serviced halting sites. The key objective of the plan is to cater for the present and projected Traveller accommodation needs in the county by providing 106 units over the next five years. For example, 15 families were accommodated in local authority houses and five on halting sites in 2002.Meeting the special needs of the elderly and disabled must be a priority, which is reflected in the funding which has been made available for special aid for the elderly, administered through the Southern Health Board together with the disabled person's grant scheme, essential repairs grant scheme and the scheme for improvement works in lieu of council housing. The total number of grants paid by local authorities in 2002 was over 9,200, an increase of nearly 3,000, costing nearly €84 million. In 1996, fewer than 3,000 grants were issued at a value of under €13 million. The improvements the Government has made to the terms and conditions of these schemes have lead to a considerable increase in activity.The issue of homelessness must be a priority for the Government and capital funding must continue to increase in this area. It is being doubled from €25 million to €50 million between 2001 and 2005. A total of 500 dwellings have been provided in the past two years under the voluntary housing assistance scheme, which shows the Government's determination and commitment to provide the funding necessary to address the issues of homelessness in a real and practical manner.In 2002, Kerry County Council adopted the homeless action plan, developed by the homeless forum under the auspices of the housing and social support strategic policy committee. The plan identified the actions required to address the growing problem of homelessness in the county, particularly in Tralee and Killarney, and provide for a co-ordinated response to the accommodation, health and welfare needs of homeless persons.The most appropriate way of addressing housing needs is to continue the various programmes which are in place by securing the necessary funding to support them, review their operation on an ongoing basis, ensure they are meeting their objectives and put in place the new programmes or measures if required. I oppose the Bill and support the Government's actions in regard to housing.

The price of houses has increased exponentially in the past few years. However, the Bill before the House is not the correct way to deal with the matter.The All-Party Committee on the Constitution is examining the issue of property rights. I appreciate that this proposed amending legislation deals specifically with housing rather than property but there is a great overlap. Sinn Féin's submission to the committee was entitled Submission on Property Rights and Housing. Deputy Morgan is a member of that committee and has participated with its hearings since its inception. Therefore, it is surprising to note that he wants a referendum ahead of the conclusion of the committee's work.

It would be a simple courtesy for the Deputy to await the outcome of the committee, rather than grandstand in this fashion.The Minister of State and Government Deputies have outlined the various achievements of the Government and local authority housing strategies. I will focus my attention this evening on the wording in this proposed amendment. The amendment proposes to create a right to housing. This is laudable and is included in some European constitutions, which is fine. The amendment then qualifies that right by saying that, where possible, this should be ensured by the initiative of each applicant. The present situation is that people are entitled to apply to a local authority for housing if they can show that their income is below a certain level.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	491	The proposed amendment would require people to show that they had made an effort to obtain housing of their own or had taken some initiative rather than simply show that their income was lower than a certain average. Fianna Fáil favours an approach based on need with regard to local authority housing, rather than on efforts made to obtain housing or initiatives taken to obtain it.I do not take lightly the proposals made here but look at them honestly to see if they can be teased out. We know this will not go to Committee Stage so it is worth figuring out Sinn Féin's thinking on the issue. Fianna Fáil thinks it would place an intolerable burden on citizens whose housing need was manifest to have to go further and show that they had made efforts and taken initiatives elsewhere, whether through housing agencies or mortgage applications. In other words, this would add a further raft of administrative requirements before they could seek local authority housing.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	492	Fianna Fáil does not make the burden tolerable.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	493	According to this amendment, the right to housing would only kick in when efforts to have oneself housed had been made by the citizen. The amendment proposes, effectively, a contingent right to housing. There is no absolute right to it. Sinn Féin recognises this, even if it does so in a ham-fisted manner.Not only is the constitutional committee looking into this issue, but on 30 December 2003 the European Convention on Human Rights will become law in this country. It states in Protocol 1: ". . .  State to enforce laws such as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties."  This will become Irish law in just over a month's time and it is important that we wait to see what impact it will have. Although the Convention Protocol will not have precedence over the Constitution, it is important to see how it bears out in our law, particularly after some test cases are taken. We are putting the cart before the horse by suggesting a referendum now.I also want to address the issue of the granting of justiciable rights for housing. There seems to be an urge to denude the Oireachtas of effective powers. The view seems to be that the Oireachtas is somehow unwilling or unable to deal with these issues. Recent Supreme Court decisions have shown that the Oireachtas can do a lot without the need for constitutional change.Another question to be settled among those who argue in favour of rights concerns how they would deal with the piecemeal accretion of housing rights. It would only be those who are in a position to take a case under the new amendment who would be able to serve an injunction on a housing authority to provide them with housing. Only those with the resources and the wherewithal to initiate proceedings would have the opportunity to provide themselves with housing.Previous housing Acts, from 1966 to 1988 in particular, have given rise to an obligation on housing authorities in terms of standards, particularly for Travellers. Section 56 of the Housing Act 1966 requires housing authorities to provide housing of a certain standard. Section 13 of the 1998 Act requires housing authorities to provide housing to members of the Traveller community. These two Acts, interpreted in the High Court on numerous occasions, have given significant rights to Travellers, which they can use against local authorities. This tends to suggest that there is no need for a constitutional amendment on this issue.Furthermore, the 1999 decision, which became the Planning and Development Act 2000, also showed there was flexibility in the Constitution in favour of the common good which allows for changes to take place. We should not mess with the Constitution, particularly when we are going through a process which has the support of every party in the House except Sinn Féin.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	495	The Minister referred to the vital centrality of the separation of powers in Irish law. He mentioned the three limbs of power, the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary. Sinn Féin wishes to delegate the right to determine resource allocation in this vital area to the Judiciary whose positions are neither elected nor easily replaceable. No judge in the Supreme Court can be fired or taken from office lightly. Judges must do something very grave to be removed from their position. If, therefore, these judges decide to interpret Sinn Féin's provisions in a certain way, they would not be accountable to this House. No committee of the Oireachtas would get the opportunity to call in members of the Judiciary to question the manner in which they would have interpreted the housing provisions Sinn Féin proposes to introduce with this amendment.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	498	If the Judiciary, for example, chose not to order the disbursement of funds in a particular case, there is no way we could question that or second guess it. The courts may, for example, say that a person is not entitled to housing under this new amendment because a citizen has not made sufficient effort to find housing on his own initiative. Here I am quoting the words proposed in this amendment.Sinn Féin's intentions in pushing this legislation may be pure but I object to the implication that the Oireachtas is unable to deal with these issues. The Minister has laid out at length some key achievements we can be proud of, and we are by no means finished. I hope Sinn Féin will be generous enough to acknowledge some of those. If it does, people may be more interested in what it has to say.Yesterday Deputy Morgan stated in his contribution that a survey carried out on behalf of the Simon Community found that 71% of those surveyed support the inclusion of a right to housing in the Constitution, that this survey was carried out last year immediately prior to the general election and that the majority of people in this State reject the Government's position. That is the basis for his argument.I always thought that it was a core principle of Sinn Féin that the majority did not have the right to be wrong. I also heard his leader, Mr. Adams, state last week that any survey can be arranged to arrive at any result, depending on the wording put into the survey.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	500	I agree with Mr. Adams on that although Deputy Morgan would be at odds with him. I am happy to see there is even a tiny bit of an independent voice within Sinn Féin. Deputy Morgan is convinced that this magical 71% somehow justifies a constitutional referendum.I would be dishonest if I did not admit my agreement with the Opposition regarding the price limits on affordable housing. They are too low and do not take into account regional differences regarding ability to pay and income levels. For example, in my area of Dún Laoghaire, house prices are far in excess of other areas, yet the same income limits apply.Sinn Féin yesterday spent some time deriding land speculation, and that is unfortunate. There may be a small number of people in possession of land in certain parts of Dublin, but there is no evidence of hoarding of land to influence price. The figures in the Fingal County Council area, which were provided for the constitutional committee yesterday, are a case in point. Under Fingal's housing strategy, it has an obligation to provide 10,000 houses by the end of this year. It has already provided over 12,000 houses, has a further 8,000 under construction and has a further 10,000 planning permissions outstanding. This would suggest that rather than an under-supply, which is the key to land hoarding, there is an over-supply. This is in a key suburban part of Dublin. All the comments made about land speculation are without foundation.

Under these provisions, would it be possible for an applicant for one-off housing to appeal a refusal of planning permission on the basis that, in spite of making every effort and taking every initiative, one still fails to obtain housing?This is not the correct time for this legislation. There has not been the appropriate consultation and it would be unfair on the many groups who have made submissions to the all-party committee.

Working people can no longer afford to buy, from two incomes, what they could have bought from one income ten or 15 years ago. There are twice as many people on local authority housing lists and, scandalously, twice as many homeless.The aspect of this issue I want to deal with specifically is that which has arisen in the past couple of day in the public media on the proposed levies for housing development. This particular proposal for new development levies, which will add from €10,000 to perhaps €30,000 to the price of a new home, arises from section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. When that section was being introduced, the Government did not tell this House or the people that it planned to use the section to hike-up, by a factor of two or three, the size of the development levies which would be charged. It told us the section would be used to consolidate existing development levies, which had been in place for quite some time, and to widen the use of the levies to include community purposes, objectives with which I and the Labour Party would agree.As with many good ideas, however, this Government has managed to convert that into a means of raising a new tax which, in this case, will be levied mainly on first-time buyers. What is wrong with the development regime being proposed throughout the country is not the principle, but the practice. First, there are managers of local authorities, which are short of money, who see an opportunity in the development levies for a new cash cow. Second, on the "Six One" television news on RTE, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government effectively announced that the Government will pull back from the funding of community facilities and leave them exclusively to local authorities which will mean that development levies will be hiked up.Third, the Government has made no provision to prevent the levies being passed on to the house buyer. The Minister stated, in a statement he issued earlier today, that developers who gain from the housing boom must fund facilities to build better communities. We would all agree with that but that is not what the development levies are doing. If they were doing so, then we would be in agreement with them. In the absence of any form of control of house prices, however, the development levies to be charged by local authorities will inevitably be passed on to house purchasers, many of whom will be first-time buyers.This is the third major whack from the Government for first-time buyers in the course of a 12-month period. This time last year it abolished the first-time buyer's grant and increased VAT on building materials by 1% which added significantly to the price of a house. Using the section 48 mechanism, it is introducing these increased development levies which will add to the price of a house.The irony is that the same Government is taking no measures to levy tax on developers who, the Minister says, have gained from the housing boom. They have gained from it, but what has the Government done to convert that gain into the provision of facilities? It reduced their capital gains tax from 40% to 20%. A couple of weeks ago, the Government voted down—

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	516	The problem with the development levy is not the principle, but the practice. It is the fact that cash-starved local authority managers are viewing the levies as a way of building up the capital fund of their authorities. If the Government used the levies as a means of converting part of the gains being made by developers on residential development into community facility development, that would be good. In the absence of some form of price control, however, that is impossible.Earlier today the Minister, Deputy Cullen, claimed that the Labour Party and Fine Gael sought to increase the levies when the planning and development legislation was before the Dáil. Nothing could be further from the truth. As you well know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we could not do so because such an amendment to increase the levy would be ruled out of order as in entailed a charge against the people. When that legislation was before the Dáil, the Labour Party attempted to broaden the use of development levies in the widest possible way to allow for the provision of community facilities; to ensure that there was democratic control over them rather than their being used as a fund by city and county managers; and to ensure that there was a system of appeals involving An Bord Pleanála. The latter was not provided for in the legislation and I correctly heard the Irish Home Builders' Association complaining about it today. There should be an appeal mechanism and, as that association correctly sought today, a regulator. There should be a regulator, not only to deal with the issue of development levies but to deal with all aspects of the housing market, including the regular gazumping of house prices. People go to look at a showhouse on a Friday thinking the price is at one level and go back the following Monday with their deposit to find that it has been increased by €15,000 or €20,000. Such practices in the housing market should also be overseen by a regulator.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I appreciate the opportunity of saying a few words again on the issue of housing and I thank my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, for allowing me that opportunity. I want to repeat some points I made only a few weeks ago when talking to people who had not voted for a long time or who were too young to vote. When they discuss housing with people like me, they have a much more straightforward view than that which we heard from the Minister of State last night. I will provide some examples.I have considered the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, in some detail. He referred to the total output of housing units last year. However, it is what he does not say which is of interest. For example, he did not say that half of the housing units which were finished last year were bought by speculators rather than first-time buyers. Is it not of significance that half of the total output goes to those who already own not one but several houses? The Minister of State did not advert to something that is significant, namely, that the Department of Finance's website's list of the top 400 earners shows that the total transfer, in tax benefits, to these people last year from the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was €72.6 million.Some of us have been looking at this matter in detail recently in respect of, for example, film relief which, as in previous years, attracted the wrath of officials of the Department of Finance. However, one of the most interesting facts about the €72.6 million given to those top earners by way of tax relief is that the greater proportion of it relates to bricks and mortar. In other words, the Minister for Finance has used the Finance Act to give, in respect of the housing market, more to those who already have housing, and that is scandalous.What would be revolutionary – perhaps people on all sides of the House could agree and an amendment to the Constitution would not be required – would be to have a property survey carried out. I can only speak about Galway, the city in which I live. Those who owned four or five houses in Galway ten years ago now own closer to 20. They recycle rents, in respect of which they enjoy tax breaks, into the low interest economy in terms of purchasing ever more building units. As far as the Minister of State is concerned, that is good. He suggested that this is all supply-side activity. It does not matter who owns the houses, how many they own or that they pay no tax on their income from housing. Until the closing of a loophole in the recent Finance Act, one could write off all one's rental income against any other form of income. This is a regressive development. It is shifting resources from other parts of the housing market to those who already have housing. How can we in a republic suggest that there should be no limit to the abuse of the housing market while also suggesting that there is a curious difficulty about accepting either the right to shelter or the right to housing?The argument about the Judiciary and the Legislature is extraordinary and a fantastic spin has been put on it, particularly by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. The Minister adopts not a democratic or liberal position but a deeply conservative one. It is based on a distortion of the norms of justice. The acceptance of rights, whether they be universal rights or those upheld by the European Convention on Human Rights, in no way automatically sets up tension between the Judiciary and the Legislature. It arises sometimes in the way one accepts the principle of justiciability, namely, how something is a justiciable right. If we suggest that these matters are entirely the responsibility of the Legislature, does that mean that the Judiciary must remain silent on rights, needs, the nature of the society and so forth? If that is what we mean, we are accepting a version of the Judiciary as being entirely non-innovative, deeply conservative and reactionary.The truth lies elsewhere. The existence or acceptance of a right in no way automatically ties the Legislature, except to seek to vindicate and apply that right such as it may. The issue in the political system is the disposal of resources to the satisfaction of rights. However, the courts are free to call into question any Administration under which the existence of that right is not accepted. This is basic.I listened to the debate last night and re-read the Minister of State's contribution earlier today. Perhaps the Minister of State opposite, Deputy Gallagher, who is a practical person, will answer a question for me. In the region of 70% of those on Galway city's housing list are on social welfare payments, while approximately 80% would not meet the criteria for affordable housing. How does it address their concerns to inform them that because affordable housing units are available to the local authority, their housing needs are being met?People should begin to speak plainly about this matter. There will never be a time when that section of the Fianna Fáil Party which seems to believe that it owes something to a section of the construction industry that is deeply involved in speculation and hoarding will change its outlook. With respect to what Deputy Andrews just said, these people have sought planning permission, sat on land, took services supplied out of taxpayers' money and waited until the price escalated until their sites represent at least 50% of the finished value of the house. How can that be regarded as a social activity which the Constitution should be used to protect? Mr. Justice Kenny considered this matter almost 30 years ago and plainly suggested that those sections in the community that stressed the common good should take priority over that kind of thinking.It is supposed to be a fundamental right in the Irish Republic that there is no limit on the number of houses a person may own. Let us consider then the concept that those who may own up to 20 or 30 houses should, if possible, not pay tax. Of the 400 top earners, because they were involved in all the different schemes and the fact that the more disposable income one has the more tax breaks one may take, 17 paid no tax. At the same time, there is an enormous slough of people on the housing list and people cannot qualify for affordable housing.I wish to refer to a particular matter to which the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, adverted at the beginning of his contribution but one which he did not follow through. What kind of country is this if two people must struggle and borrow money from their parents to pay a deposit and become mortgage slaves? This is an invitation to misery which involves enormous social consequences.I will relate a story to the House which tells me how this malaise begun. As a former Minister, I attended the opening of a significant cultural institution at the invitation of the director. A former Secretary General of a Department said that he thought this is a great country and that he never thought that his son would buy a house for £250,000. I took one good look at him and realised what was wrong. The thinking that produces that kind of comment is so backward, regressive, reactionary and anti-social, it would make one cringe with shame to live in the same country as this senior adviser and decision-maker. On another occasion, I will be delighted to give him full credit for his comment.

It was good to listen to my old college lecturer, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, in full flow.I regret the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not present. He stated on the "Six One News" that people were engaging in scaremongering about levies on houses. I have in my possession the proposed draft levies from Wicklow. For a house on the services the levy will be €140 per square metre. Under the draft proposals, therefore, the levy for a 200,000 sq. m. house will be €28,000. That is a matter of record, it is not scaremongering. For a house of similar size in the countryside and not on the services, the levy will be €101 per square metre or €20,000 in total. The proposed cost for an average sized home on the services is €17,500. This is not scaremongering.The draft proposals have been published because Government will not fund local authorities in terms of infrastructural needs. The Minister of State said that those who pay will benefit, which is untrue. Many people who never pay for services will benefit from the levies collected from the unfortunate few to improve services. This new system in inequitable for two reasons. First, if there has been an infrastructure deficit in a local authority area, the local authority will be penalised in future. Why will the levy only be €5,000 or €10,000 in Counties Kerry and Kilkenny while in County Wicklow it will be double or treble that amount? Second, a small number of people entering the housing market, primarily first-time buyers, will pick up the tab for services. My water supply is not in great order and the local authority intends to upgrade it. The new first-time buyer will pay for that, not me. That is inequitable, unfair and unsustainable. It is not correct that the Government is passing the buck to local authorities. The Government has been repeating the mantra of low taxation for some years. The downside is it has no money to do anything.

I am not surprised the Government is opposed to the Bill because, when the words the Government is adept at voicing must give way to definitive action and commitment, the shadow falls and we see the fundamental difference between how a democratic socialist, for example, or a person with social consciousness would approach the question of housing and how Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats approach it. We approach housing as a human need, a fundamental human right and a right that is necessary to have a life of reasonable comfort and dignity whereas the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats approach is to endorse the speculator, the profiteer and the large developer, who see primarily in the provision of housing a source to amass major profits relentlessly at the expense of ordinary working people.The Government stands utterly condemned by the housing crisis. The average price of a second-hand semi-detached home in the modest suburb in which I live has quadrupled during the six and a half years Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been in power. This is due to the naked outright profiteering that these parties have allowed to take place in the housing market. The Government sat on its hands and allowed a small cabal of major landowners, speculators and developers to massively increase the price of a home out of sheer greed. There was no rush to the High Court to stop this happening nor to the Garda to demand an explanation for the racketeering in the housing market, nor was anybody put behind the bars of Mountjoy Prison similar to decent taxpayers who are there tonight because they took on the Government on another issue on which it is guilty.Naked profiteering was permitted to continue and it is creating major problems. These profiteers have funded Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, which have traditionally been in their pockets. We have witnessed a further glimpse of this at the tribunals over the past few days and we have seen what a mockery was made of the so-called internal investigations of the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil parties into donations their councillors accepted from developers and speculators. Amounts hidden from these investigations have emerged in the past few days.

It is another massive levy on young people attempting to buy a home. It will take them 20 or 25 years to repay the levy, including interest. What kind of a way is that to make housing available to people?
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	532	Ba mhaith liom tacaíocht a thabhairt don leasú bunreachtúil seo a cuireadh os ár gcomhair ag grúpa Shinn Féin: is é sin go mbeidh ceart tithíochta mar cheart soisialta sa Bhunreacht. Is cóir go mbeadh cearta soisialta mar seo mar chuid den mBunreacht.I fully support the proposed Bill to establish the right to housing as a constitutional right. I applaud the Sinn Féin group for using Private Members' time to highlight this and to attempt to address this major issue in society, which is the social right to a home of one's own. I support the Bill principally because it serves to focus our attention again on a vitally important issue, the basic right of all our people to decent living accommodation, which successive Governments have failed to confront. The Government has refused to take radical action to address this fundamental issue.Most Members will undoubtedly agree the breathtaking cost of houses and the massive price increases that have spiralled out of control in recent years are totally unjustifiable and demand action. The scandal of homelessness is a black mark on the State, as are the lengthy waiting lists for local authority housing. Profiteers and racketeers lurk in the background as they racketeer in new house prices and land values. A small number of multimillionaires control the bulk of development land in the Dublin region. This is unsustainable and unjustifiable and no amount of tinkering with the system will change it.Even when a mildly progressive measure specifying that 20% of developments should be set aside for social and affordable housing was introduced, the same obsessively greedy developers and builders banded together to smash that attempt at reform and fairness. The Government capitulated to the developers' lobby and that progressive measure was abandoned, demonstrating the unseemly political influence of builder-developer interests in Ireland, regardless of the common good. While developers and builders manipulate and control the housing market in a manner that allows them to maximise their vast profits, the number of unfortunate people joining the local authority housing waiting lists steadily increases and it currently stands at almost 50,000 applicants, the bulk of which are families.It is well documented that Ireland has one of the most unequal societies in the developed world, with an ever-increasing gap between rich and poor. This inequality is the direct result of the budgetary policies of successive Governments over the past decade, which deliberately favoured the better off in line with the philosophy of the Progressive Democrats and their like-minded friends in the leadership of Fianna Fáil. Nowhere is this glaring inequality more starkly visible than in the housing market.The average price of a house in Dublin is now in excess of €300,000, which will increase dramatically when the builders add on the new levies announced today by the Government. The latest phenomenon is the increasing number of new housing schemes being advertised in the property supplements, such as Abbots Hill in Malahide, with prices starting at €1.35 million. The same property supplements advise investors of the merits of properties at locations from New Zealand to South Africa and Florida. At another level, parallel to this, increasing numbers of Irish people see the chance of getting a home of their own as being more and more beyond their reach. The political philosophy which produces this inequality is the most corrupting influence in Ireland today.

The basic human right to adequate housing has been recognised in the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Ireland has also signed up to the UN Convention on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights, which also recognises the right to housing. Housing rights have also been recognised internationally in instruments which seek to address and protect the rights of particular groups, such as the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination.Article 136 of the Treaty of the European Union, in instituting the European Economic Community, refers to the fundamental social rights set out in the European Social Charter, which includes the right to housing. However, zero progress has been made by Ireland in incorporating what we acknowledge to be a basic human right into our Constitution, a matter noted with regret by the UN convention. Currently, our EU partners Belgium, Spain and Portugal have incorporated the right to housing in their constitutions, while those of Greece, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden and Germany contain aspirations to promote people's rights. In law, France, Denmark, the UK, Italy and Luxembourg acknowledge the duty of the state to provide suitable housing for their citizens.Ireland's Housing Act of 1988 obliges local authorities to assess the importance of housing needs, to make a census of homeless persons and to set housing priorities. While we like to feel that we live in a healthy democracy, with a Constitution which is second to none, people are still living in subhuman conditions on pavements, in doorways and on the streets of our major cities and towns. In the case of Traveller families throughout the country, they are compelled to exist on roadsides and in laneways in quite appalling conditions in all weathers. The right to adequate housing is an important component of the right to live with dignity and, accordingly, an obvious component of the right to equality.The only way to ensure an end to Ireland's growing problem of homelessness is by way of a constitutional guarantee. Enshrining the right to housing in our Constitution would afford people the facility of recourse to justice through the courts if the State failed to provide for their housing needs.In recent years, the lack of availability of land and property at reasonable cost has imposed major difficulties for agencies trying to deliver social housing. Housing associations are trying to compete on the open market against speculators and investors for much-needed and increasingly scarce land available from local authority landbanks. In the last national housing needs assessment, over 48,000 families were assessed as being in need of social housing.I understand that the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution has recommended a number of issues, including the right to shelter, which will be considered in a review of property rights under the Constitution. Of particular interest is the right to shelter, since there is currently no right to housing included in the Constitution. It will be a new departure in Ireland for the right to housing to be considered against the backdrop of private property rights, something which must be led by Government.Landowners, down the years, have creamed off windfall profits and benefits from ownership of land due to improvements paid for by the public, including waste services, transport, rezoning, etc. The right to private property would not be prejudiced by the inclusion in the Constitution of a right to housing. The failure of current housing policy becomes more apparent daily as the homelessness crisis continues to intensify. Although some 10,000 Irish people are homeless, local authorities are not obliged to provide accommodation for them. The constitutional amendment, incorporating the right to housing, should be accompanied by ratification of Article 31 of the European Social Charter which relates to housing rights. Go raibh maith agat.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	534	In a similar effort by the Green Party to address the housing issue some months ago, we were disappointed that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government did not turn up to hear the arguments on the final night of the debate. I also commend the Labour Party on having introduced a Bill to try to address the present housing crisis. Tonight, I commend Sinn Féin for addressing this matter. However, although this is one of the most important issues in our society, once again the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has not turned up. I consider that disgraceful. It is indicative of an arrogant Government which has been in power too long.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government seems to have a disregard for proper planning. When he was asked recently how he would address the sprawl of Dublin and whether he would intervene with the surrounding counties, which are providing massive rezoning for further increases in housing, he said that was not his role. In my area, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where a new development plan is currently in train, the Minister has intervened to tell the council it has not rezoned sufficient land and is not providing enough houses.There is no rationale as to the location of those houses or whether there is proper planning, including links to public transport. That is central to the housing crisis which has been caused by the Government. The Taoiseach's only answer is to say, "We built 60,000 houses last year."  However, there is no sense of understanding as to the ownership of those houses, where they are being provided and what kind of society we are developing with that housing market.Almost half those houses are being bought by speculators who are availing of the tax breaks, interest-only mortgages and massive rent allowances the Government is providing, which go back directly to those with property to rent, rather than those seeking to rent. All of the benefits are going to property owners and speculators, but not helping those struggling to pay the rent. Another substantial sector of the housing market involves holiday homes. As the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, will be aware, in counties such as Donegal and throughout the west and south coasts, local people are being priced out of the market by people purchasing second homes and availing of the various tax breaks provided. There is fantastic activity, but it is not for the benefit of those who really need housing.In the recent mid-term review, the ESRI recommended that the Government should introduce a levy to take account of the massive cost of servicing those houses. The Taoiseach immediately said that, having been down that road before, we could not possibly consider a levy on second-hand holiday homes. However, two weeks later, the Government brought in a development levy in which there is no sophistication and no cognisance is taken of whether the houses concerned are in urban or rural areas or the cost of providing services – it is simply a straight levy or stealth tax.There is a lack of thinking and planning with regard to housing. There is an extraordinary emphasis on getting onto the property ladder, on the basis that one only has rights if one owns property. Perhaps one can visualise the situation in terms of a long castle wall, with people scrambling up various "property ladders" to get into the castle. In some cases, they have missed the boat, the ladder has just been lifted up and they are informed they cannot board the rich ship, Ireland. While other people may be on the ladder, the property market may change, prices may go down and their ladder will fall back into the moat.At another point, people may have built a 100 foot extension to their property ladder, tilted at an angle. Their whole lives revolve around getting up that ladder. Meanwhile, from its vantage point on the parapet at the top of the castle, the Government congratulates itself on the tremendous level of activity which is in progress, while overlooking the misery, injustice and division which it is creating for generations to come. There is no planning. There is no environmental or social thinking and ultimately that will be a cost to our economy. People are desperately climbing up all those ladders and it is a terrible shame the Minister is not here to talk about it.

Deputy Allen talked it down very effectively when he said: "The Bill as proposed is flawed."  He rightly stated that the Bill would not go anywhere towards solving the housing challenges we face.The Government does not shirk its responsibilities in relation to housing. We have a proud record of achievement in delivering housing across the broad spectrum of housing needs. My colleague the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, outlined last night the comprehensive range of housing measures the Government has implemented and, more importantly, he clearly demonstrated the positive effects of these measures.

Almost 57,700 new houses were completed in 2002, the eighth successive record year of housing output, and 2003 will be another record year. The overall objective of the Government is to continue to maintain these record levels of output to satisfy the projected housing demand. By introducing this Bill, Sinn Féin, in effect, wants the Government to back-pedal on the clearly demonstrable progress we have made – it wants to remove from the Oireachtas and the Government the power to distribute resources which has been the cornerstone of the Government's success in delivering the highest level of social and affordable housing for over 15 years.Ireland has a proud tradition of home ownership, and the Government feels strongly about maintaining and promoting this tradition. Increasing supply is and must remain the main objective of the Government's housing strategy. We must ensure that our young population can aspire to home ownership or seek rented accommodation whether in the private or social housing sector.

The abolition of the new house grant was mentioned in the debate. While obviously of benefit to those who qualify, its economic impact had long since been absorbed into house prices. Its abolition demonstrates, however, that the Government will take difficult decisions when required. In making this decision we have made a commitment to focus the resources available on the range of better targeted programmes introduced in recent years to meet the needs of low income groups and those with social housing needs.I acknowledge that for some people home ownership has become more difficult. This is why the Government places great emphasis on increasing output under the shared ownership and affordable housing measures. The Opposition forgets, in its blinkered view, that it was never easy to buy a first house.

The article was not included in our ratification pending clarification as to its interpretation – that is, whether the article seeks to confer a legal right to housing which would be justiciable in the Irish courts system. The Government's approach to the Social Charter recognises that conferring a right to housing on citizens would not of itself afford any greater access to them to the housing services necessary to meet their needs. The challenges we face require practical solutions and it is on this premise that the Government's housing strategy is founded.The Government has a coherent and credible housing strategy—

As far back as 1987 a UN General Assembly resolution called upon all states to pay special attention to the realisation of the right to housing. The European Parliament has adopted at least two resolutions on this issue, one in 1987 stating that the right to a home should be guaranteed by legislation and that member states should recognise it as a fundamental right. A resolution in 1996 stated that non-implementation of the right to housing on the part of states: ". . . is a breach of the principles and democratic values on which European society is based."As a consequence of the instruments I have outlined, both Ministers of State, Deputies Ahern and Gallagher, must recognise that Ireland has international obligations in relation to the right to housing. We on this side of the House charge that those obligations have not been fulfilled.The right to housing is more properly defined as the right to adequate and appropriate housing, which is reflected by the wording of the Sinn Féin amendment. No less than 12 different UN texts explicitly recognise the right to adequate housing, and as such this concept has joined the body of universally applicable and accepted human rights law. According to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right therefore includes: legal security of tenure, availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, habitability, accessibility, location and cultural adequacy. Without constitutional protection the most marginalised in Irish society will continue to suffer from Government neglect. As the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has observed, housing rights can be subject to violation by Governments, and we see such violations in this State.We want constitutional protections that will ensure all sections of society can enjoy their equal rights to adequate and appropriate housing and to move beyond a situation where Travellers continue to be arrested and charged with an offence because the Government has failed to implement Traveller accommodation plans. I must contradict the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who said last night that great progress had been made on this.

If we are serious about tackling the current crisis, we need all surplus State and Roman Catholic Church lands transferred immediately to local authorities for social housing provision. In my constituency the State has offloaded to an offshore property company a prime 13 acre site, Clancy Barracks, which could have provided social housing for almost 600 families. That is a classic example of Government's skewed priorities.

Where are the Minister of State's colleagues in Government? The members of one political party have not even had the good manners to present themselves throughout this debate on one the most urgent and pressing matters facing people today. The Progressive Democrats have clearly spoken on this issue by their absence.Let there be no mistake, there are the necessary resources to meet the housing needs of the people. They have always been there. Regrettably, successive Governments have failed to utilise those resources to ensure adequate provision of housing for the people. Over decades hundreds of thousands of families have suffered from the failure of successive Governments adequately to address that need. That is a fact. No failure has been more glaring than that of the Government, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition, which during the past six years has been blessed with one of the most vibrant economic situations that allowed it to address this issue as no previous Government could, but it has failed miserably. That is the reality.One need only note the statistics. The Minister of State was happy to cite them last night. However, let us look at the real statistics. The Government has presided over a 177% increase in the cost of new housing over the period since 1998.

On the local authority housing waiting list there are some 50,000 household units which, conservatively, must equate to at least in excess of 100,000 citizens waiting to be housed in this jurisdiction. They are in every county. This need is not confined only to people of Dublin, other large urban centres or Monaghan. I advise the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, there are also people from Donegal on the waiting list.Some 85% of those households on the local authority waiting list are depending on an annual income of less than €15,000. Let us get real and recognise that there is a real housing crisis in this jurisdiction. The needs of these families are not being met.Ministers have repeatedly boasted, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, last night, about the raw figure for output of housing units. That figure tells us nothing about the affordability of each of those units, the proportion of them destined for the social housing market, or about what number of them are for second home use by speculators or for use in the rented property sector. That is the reality. The Minister of State can try to confuse the argument by citing statistics on new units developed or brought on to the market but until he addresses those critical issues he is only creating a smokescreen behind which he and his colleagues in Government have been hiding for far too long.In whose interest have he and his colleagues in Government acted? Let there be no mistake that the Government has continually sought to aid only those who are involved in property speculation, those who have a direct interest in the rented sector, the landlord class – those who seek to exploit the opportunity of house provision. His cosy relationship with them is clearly evidenced by the continual influx of funding into the coffers of Fianna Fáil.This relationship was evidenced even more by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who this week took the opportunity to have lunch with the Construction Industry Federation. What advice did he seek in his address to that body? He asked its advice on housing policy. Is that credible? What influence has the CIF had on its fellow travellers but to demand and secure within the narrowest time the total reversal of Part 5 of the Planning Act, something it had demanded, yet its members are the people from whom the Minister of State seeks advice on housing policy. Would he think for one moment that he should ask the advice of a single mother struggling to bring up her child or children in expensive rented accommodation?

He would deny their very existence, leaving blinkered from the gates of this institution and refusing to see the facts and evidence of the failure of this Government and successive Governments on the streets of this city. Shame on him.Sinn Féin wants to see housing enshrined in the Constitution in order – let there be no mistake about it – to underpin a whole range of other necessary measures and legislation that needs to be introduced to tackle the inequalities in the housing sector. The Government has failed to take heed of the continual outcry of representative organisations, who have campaigned on behalf of the homeless and the sector that is depending on the provision of social housing, and voices in this Chamber who have continually argued, sought his attention and demanded that he heed them.In this debate and elsewhere, Sinn Féin has spelt out in detail the other measures that will be necessary and will go in tandem with this proposed constitutional change. They include controls on the price of land for housing, controls over rents in the private sector, the freeing up of State lands, appropriate accommodation for Travellers.

There were over 300 applicants competing for 30 household units. There will be 30 happy and contented families, with 270 more left worrying in anguish and stress. What prospects have they got with no further housing starts signalled for that small community? That is magnified in larger communities throughout the length and breadth of this State.At least the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, has participated in the debate. However, I say to him that under the Constitution as it currently stands, there is more protection for a block of luxury apartments in the ownership of a multimillionaire property developer than there is for the homeless in this State. That is a damning indictment of each of the Ministers of State. They and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, should vacate their portfolios because they are unsuited to them. They have demonstrated this time and again by their utterances and failure to act.

It is important that a new category is introduced which would allow people with disability, those over 55 and the long-term unemployed, to remain on their community employment or FÁS schemes. Is the Minister in favour of this, especially in the light of the review of the existing criteria for FÁS schemes? FÁS is wonderful, the people who run it are magnificent and the participants are real heroes. FÁS has changed the face of Ireland in so many positive ways.I know that FÁS numbers were cut from 40,000 to 25,000 and that they are now down to 20,000. This is because the Government felt there were so many non-nationals looking for work that the Irish workforce should be engaged from FÁS numbers. A section of FÁS participants will never be re-trained sufficiently for them to enter the general workforce. These are the groups to which I refer.At present, under FÁS rules someone under 35 years of age can work for only one year on a scheme. In exceptional circumstances they are allowed to remain in employment for a second year. It is, however, very much the exception rather than the rule that a person would get two years. Even an individual with a chronic disability does not usually get more than a year on a FÁS scheme if they are under 35 years of age. Those over 35 years are entitled to work for three years on a FÁS scheme; after that they must finish, without exception. The aim of FÁS is to re-train people for the workforce but those over 55 years of age, those with chronic disability or those in long-term unemployment are unlikely ever to get back into the workforce.A multiple sclerosis community employment scheme covers counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon. It is a magnificent scheme which does wonderful work. I am glad to say this project will be renewed for a further year, but half its participants are due to be let go. All the participants suffer from multiple sclerosis, which is a lifelong illness. As they come from the most deprived rural areas, there is no alternative employment for them. I met with these people and was most impressed by them. They perform valuable work in a supported environment. The scheme allows them to earn an honest living. Cutting back this scheme will mean insufficient staffing for it, thereby bringing about an inadequate service. This will result in the failure to provide essential services to this vulnerable group of people who suffer from multiple sclerosis.The following is an extract from an article written by an MS sufferer which appeared in the autumn 2003 copy of Health Links, a publication of the Western Health Board, which spells out the position in which such people find themselves:I had to tell my employers about my MS and I was told I had to leave my job because their insurance would not cover me. That news really cut me up. I felt useless and depressed and could see no way out.That is a true reflection of the dilemmas such people face.I have talked to those people and they say that FÁS is a lifeline. The Minister can light a candle which will become a flame. It might be a small matter in the scheme of things but it means everything to them.The seven participants who are about to be laid off are all MS sufferers who do not have any other hope of employment. How could it be justified to lay them off? According to the rules, they have to be laid off after one year if they are less than 35 years of age and after three years if they are aged over 35. The cost to the State of keeping a long-term unemployed person on a FÁS scheme is only €20 to €30 extra per week, yet people are laid off to go back on the unemployment scrap heap. This does not make sense. Some €30 per week is a small price to pay for the dignity and everything else which employment gives to these people. Why not leave them on the FÁS scheme? It is time to create a new category of scheme.This scheme provides a lifeline to these MS sufferers whom I have met. It is a tragedy that they are being laid off because many of them were previously laid off from regular employment because of the onset of illness. As I said, employers said they would not be covered for insurance purposes. This scheme does great work, including visiting people affected with multiple sclerosis in their homes. It also operates a day club for MS sufferers which operates during the week with, on average, up to 20 participants. The scheme also organises physiotherapy for MS sufferers. The work includes bringing people from Belmullet for physiotherapy and day-trips.Last year the scheme received support from the Western Health Board but this year no extra funding was given as it was not available. The participants had to raise €3,000. These people are heroes doing good work under the auspices of FÁS. Does the Minister of State not agree that it would be better to put the long-term unemployed, those over 55 years of age and those with chronic disability, regardless of age, in a special category so that they can be retained long-term on community employment schemes? FÁS has given these people new dignity and a purpose in life. It seems perverse that a review of the present criteria for community employment programmes should not include the making of a special category for those groups I have mentioned.

I am not aware that additional people are to be let go. We are down to 20,000 at this stage. I will look at this case. I would be concerned, as the Deputy is, about people who have disability.The essence of the community employment schemes since their inception, going back to the days of the social employment scheme, was that the maximum period of employment was for three years, after which people could no longer remain on the schemes. This has always been the case and it is no different now from for many years.I find this matter somewhat strange in that I announced in the House on a number of occasions my intentions in regard to community employment schemes. I am surprised the Deputy is not aware that, on at least three occasions, I told the House that it is my intention in the new community employment scheme – subject to Government approval and finance being made available – to have a new category for people over 55 years of age who would be given an opportunity to go back on schemes after they had concluded a period on unemployment assistance and also that we should have a special category for people on disability payments and those with special needs.I am, therefore, rather surprised that the Deputy should ask us to consider a new category when that has been flagged on a number of occasions. It strikes me as if—

In addition, a comprehensive service will be provided to communities across the country and a special effort will be made to ensure that those people who are not capable of progressing into full-time employment will have a better opportunity to participate in community employment programmes. Deputy Cowley should not take any credit for that.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I would appreciate being told when two and a half minutes are up to permit me to share time with my colleague, Deputy Stanton. Hopefully, I will receive a slightly more detailed response than did Deputy Cowley.We are concerned about Fort Mitchel, Spike Island, which is a prison facility established in 1985. It is a closed, medium-security prison for the detention of young males aged between 16 and 24 years. While it can hold up to 102 inmates, there are 93 there at present. Of these, 20 are under the age of 18.Fort Mitchel has built a reputation over the last decade for its excellent prison education and rehabilitation programmes. Some 85% of prisoners participate in an education programme with good exam results each year. Some 45 inmates completed the drug awareness programme last year while 37 completed the pre-release programme. There is also a post-release programme of which the Minister is probably aware. There are 93 prison officers at the prison and 17 teachers, many of whom have taught there since 1986.What sum has been involved in capital expenditure to develop Spike Island in the last five years? How can the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform reconcile that expenditure with the threat to close the facility on 1 January? Can the Minister explain where the prisoners will go should he not get his way and, if the worst having come to the worst, the prison closes? Will they go to Limerick? They will not be able to take their education programme there as it is sponsored in part by the VEC in Cork. Obviously, it cannot shift to Limerick seamlessly. Where will the prison officers go should the prison close?What has happened in respect of the new wing in Cork Prison which the former Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, turned the sod for less than two years ago? It has been promised on many occasions on and off the record.What is the Minister's strategy on Fort Mitchel? Is it purely a game of hardball to frighten the life out of prison officers and their families to ensure that they agree to his demands on overtime and pay? If so, is the Minister to refuse to sit down and negotiate in a civilised manner with the prison officers over the coming weeks?
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	623	I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House. This is a serious issue and it would have been better if we could have had a more interactive question and answer session. This issue is so serious that it has the potential to be a disaster if things go wrong. I wish the Minister well in his endeavours to resolve the problem and I call on all sides to sit down and negotiate realistically to reach a solution. There is too much at stake not to do that. It is too serious and too important for everybody involved.What will happen now? Does the Minister have any answers with regard to the students? Does he realise that this facility in Cork has been very successful over the years in the education and rehabilitation programmes Deputy Coveney outlined? Over 20 years experience has been built up at Fort Mitchel and there are quite a number of teachers working there who are very experienced in dealing with the prison population. They are committed to working at the prison. I call on the Department, the Irish Prison Service and the prison officers to ensure that all this is not lost.The inmates of the prison are mainly from the south and it will be very difficult for their families if they are transferred to other parts of the country. I also wish to point out to the Minister the implications for the local economy, though that is a side issue. It has already been hit very hard by closures of industry in the area. Fort Mitchel is one of the largest employers in Cobh and we will see other job losses in the area if the prison is closed. If the prison is closed now, it will be very difficult to reopen. The State has invested a large amount of money there over the years.I look forward to hearing the Minister's contribution. One of the major problems in our prisons is drugs. Fort Mitchel is largely drug free and it would be a shame to lose that ethos. There is a great deal at stake nationally and locally. We do not want to see what has been built up over the years being lost. We want to see a resolution to this problem. I support the Minister in his endeavours to resolve the matter, but he must be careful. I call on the prison officers to step back also, to get around the table and to thrash this out away from the glare of the media spotlight. The debate should not take place in the media where people tend to adopt strong positions. I realise the Minister has provided a window of opportunity which is open until the middle of December and I hope and pray the issue can be resolved before then. I wish the Minister and the prison officers well. Let us hope the Minister has some good news for us tonight with regard to the future of the young people who are locked away.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and I start by making it clear that I, personally, do not want to close or even mothball Fort Mitchel Place of Detention. However, if the Prison Officers' Association is unwilling to agree reasonable terms for the operation of prisons on an economically sustainable basis, it is a course I will reluctantly have to pursue. The responsibility for the choice which must be made rests entirely with the association.The background to much of this discussion is already known to Deputies. If we cannot get agreement on new working arrangements with prison staff, the Government will have to take action on the unsustainable cost structure in the Prison Service. The Government decided yesterday that it will, in the absence of agreement, mothball Fort Mitchel, Spike Island, and the Curragh Place of Detention from 1 January 2004.Fort Mitchel is a medium-security institution and its population is drawn largely from the Munster area, as Deputies have said. The prison's population is predominantly young and in the late teen to mid-20s age group. As of this morning, there were 91 prisoners in custody though the prison can accommodate 102. If this scenario comes into effect, it is intended that the prisoners in Fort Mitchel will, in the main, be transferred to Cork and Limerick prisons and to St. Patrick's Institution.The newly-built block in Limerick Prison has room for up to 100 prisoners and could potentially accommodate all of the current Fort Mitchel population. However, it would not be a simple case of moving the population of the prison as a unit to Limerick. Some prisoners would be more suitable for St. Patrick's Institution in Dublin. Some movement of existing prisoners from Cork Prison to Limerick is also likely, which would in turn facilitate the placement of some of the Fort Mitchel population in Cork. While the majority of Fort Mitchel prisoners will be moved to Limerick, each case will be looked at individually to effect a transfer which is most appropriate. It is intended that all transfers will take place close together, as staff transfers will take place at the same time. There are currently 94 staff serving at Fort Mitchel.The mothballing of the place of detention at Fort Mitchel will temporarily reduce the number of spaces available to the Irish Prison Service by a total of 102. However, this is almost exactly cancelled out by bringing into commission of new accommodation in Limerick. The re-deployment of staff from Fort Mitchel will allow this to happen. In terms of regime, there will be no major difference in the level of security under which the prisoners are held. They will move from one closed institution to another and, in many cases, the move will be to a more modern facility, so their conditions will be at least equivalent to those experienced in Fort Mitchel.I read with considerable sympathy the views of teachers regarding the excellent facilities in Fort Mitchel and concerns that prisoners will not get the same opportunities elsewhere. However, while I fully acknowledge that excellent work is being done in Fort Mitchel in terms of education and other types of activities, I emphasise that the prisoners will continue to have opportunities available to them to continue their development in their new institution. For example, the regime in St. Patrick's Institution is considered by experts to be a model of its kind.I fully appreciate the entirely understandable concern of the teachers regarding their posts in Fort Mitchel and, in this context, I repeat what I said yesterday. However, the teachers and the TUI, which represents them, should express their concerns to the POA, as it is its reluctance to engage in meaningful negotiations that has led us to where we are now. It insists on a regime in the prisons which is no longer sustainable. I have stated already that I do not want to close Fort Mitchel or any other institution. However, if the POA leaves me no option, I am clear on what course of action must be followed.I must reiterate that this action is not being taken lightly. It will be done solely because the Irish Prison Service cannot continue to spend public money feeding an overtime culture which has gone completely out of control and is sustaining grossly inefficient work practices. Fort Mitchel prison should have a future in the Irish Prison Service. I say to the Deputies and anyone else who is listening that prison staff have it in their power to save these institutions. However, they must make a choice. To date they have rejected all reasonable efforts to involve them in negotiations. The Deputies challenged me to meet them out of the public eye in a non-confrontational manner and I will do so. As I told the POA at its annual conference, I will take any step necessary to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion. However, no one should underestimate the Government's determination that this matter will be addressed this year because next year no money will be made available to feed the outrageous and scandalous overtime culture in the Irish Prison Service which has existed heretofore.With any goodwill which is available, it will be possible to achieve agreement on sensible work practices and an annualised hours system, which is good for staff and the Prison Service as a whole. I assure the Deputies that, in that event, Fort Mitchel will resume its role as a closed prison. However, the choice is one which falls to the Prison Officers' Association and I will assist it to make it. However, my resolve should not be doubted or underestimated. The end has come for the existing overtime culture.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	625	I thank the Minister for taking this debate in the House.I seek clarification of what the Minister meant when he announced that Loughan House, County Cavan, and Shelton Abbey, County Wicklow, will be run by an outside agency. Loughan House has accommodation for 85 inmates and employs 45 personnel at all levels. It costs approximately €63,000 per annum to maintain a prisoner there, compared with €207,000 in Portlaoise.Can the Minister explain why one of the most effective prisons in terms of cost as well as training, is now under threat? Most of the 45 staff live and work in this hard-pressed area and if they are forced to move to other prisons, it will have a major effect on schools, churches and sports clubs.In spite of the peace process, the Government has failed to provide decentralisation and other job opportunities along the Border. Loughan House authorities work with the VEC and FÁS to provide certified courses in forklift driving, hoists, safe-pass, driving theory tests and so on. Some 47 inmates received their safe-pass certificates recently. They also carried out training in alcohol awareness and money and budgeting advice and a number of inmates are working on farms.The Taoiseach is visiting County Cavan on Friday and I trust that he will use the opportunity to show a commitment to the Border region and to Loughan House in particular. He must not allow the Minister or anyone else to remove this important open prison and its staff. Most of the staff have been there for 20 years and have their roots there. Some eight or ten years ago, there was anxiety in the region in regard to prisoners not being properly controlled. However, with good management and co-operation with the local community, there are no longer any such anxieties. I dread to think what would happen if any inexperienced personnel are put in place or, worse, if the Garda Síochána, which is already under severe pressure, must be used to replace the prison staff.I wish the Minister well in his negotiations. I am genuinely angry that Loughan House should be abandoned and would appreciate anything he can do to retain it.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue. I am glad the Minister has been in a position to attend and respond to the debate. The Minister has quite correctly stated that the overtime regime in the Irish Prison Service must change. Every prison officer to whom I have spoken in recent months, recognises that the present regime is unsustainable and there must be major changes. Likewise, prison officers agree there are too many restrictive practices which must change too. In the present deadlocked position, one way in which to move forward is to engage the services of the Labour Relations Commission. I hope it is possible for the Minister, his Department and the Irish Prison Service to engage with the Prison Officers Association through the State's industrial relations machinery.Last night, I spoke to members of the POA who hold positions within the organisation and they told me they are willing to negotiate through that machinery. Since the Minister's appointment, he has correctly pointed out the need to upgrade many of the existing prison facilities. Some of the conditions are Dickensian to say the least and the Minister has identified the need to spend capital funding on upgrading facilities. This is essential, not just for the prison population, but for the prison staff who are working in out-dated conditions.As Deputy Crawford pointed out, I am familiar with Loughan House too. Since the early 1970s, the institution has played a key and positive role in the penal service. It has consistently been the most cost-effective prison in the State for some time for which I commend the governor, Mr. Brennan, and his staff. The staff are committed to the prison and to their local community. They want to see Loughan House remain as a detention centre and retain its present status. Loughan House, under the auspices of County Cavan vocational education committee, has an education centre where a dedicated, highly-skilled staff give of themselves positively to their pupils, the prison population. Many of those who have availed of the education services have achieved FETAC and ECDL awards despite having come with little or no education in the first place. The education centre has advanced technology and equipment which was provided over the past few years.I had the opportunity to visit Loughan House on a number of occasions, with the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon, and Ministers who came to visit the centre. Its facilities have been upgraded over the past decade. I look forward to it remaining as a place of detention. I hope the Minister will visit it in the new year to announce an extension.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	627	I am grateful to the two Deputies who raised this matter. Open centres play an important role in our penal system and will continue to do so. They provide a necessary alternative for dealing with those prisoners for whom the traditional high walls and internal restrictions are not appropriate. In open centres, prisoners are not locked into their rooms at night. Reliance is placed on them not to abscond and there are few restrictions on their movements in the prison complex. As a regime, it represents the closest thing the Prison Service can offer to conditions on the outside. The overall focus is one of either preparation for release of prisoners coming to the end of their sentence or the containment of prisoners considered a low security risk but not yet suitable for release.I support the work open centres do and acknowledge the efforts put in by many people in Loughan House and Shelton Abbey over the years. I go further and say that I see an enhanced role for the open centre in the criminal justice system. In an ideal world, we should be looking at more open regimes, either separately or as self-contained elements within larger institutions on a model like that of the Grove in Castlerea where prisoners are accommodated in self-contained houses. However, we are not in an ideal world. We are prevented, by the millstone of excessive and unnecessary overtime, from doing the things for which people inside and outside the system have been calling for years, including ending slopping out in our oldest prisons – the Dickensian practice to which Deputy Smith referred – and providing better quality accommodation in our open centres. In the current circumstances the money is just not there to set about this work because almost all our capital expenditure is being cannibalised for overtime.As of this morning, there were 52 prisoners in Shelton Abbey – there is a capacity of 56 – predominantly drawn from the Dublin-Leinster area although people from any part of the country could be housed there. In the main they are serving sentences of one year or less. Some 41 prison officers are employed there. Loughan House currently has 74 prisoners – there is a capacity of 85 – many of whom are from the western and north-western areas of the country. Again the sentences are short to medium in the main. Loughan House is the place of employment of 45 officers. There will be no job losses as prison officers from both institutions will be reallocated to other prisons to reduce pressure on overtime. There will be no closure of either institution. The decision the Government took yesterday is to move these facilities out of the control of the Prison Service. This is one of the measures which will be necessary if agreement cannot be reached with the POA by the end of the year.My Department is carefully examining the exact arrangements which need to be put in place to give effect to this decision. This will entail detailed consideration of what best meets offenders' needs and the needs of the Irish Prison Service. I assure Deputies of two things, first, the transfer must go ahead in the absence of an agreement on the new annualised hours working arrangements for the Prison Service and, second, whatever is put in place, offenders will not be disadvantaged by the move. I envisage offenders in these centres enjoying the same conditions which currently prevail.I am perfectly content for these open centres to continue to be operated by the Prison Service and staffed by prison officers, provided it is done on a sensible, reasonable and effective basis. That is simply not the case at present, and it will never be the case as long as the existing inefficient work practices and unsustainable overtime culture continue. In some respects the open centres, vital though their role and objectives are, illustrate the unsustainability of the present system, with staffing levels more appropriate to a closed prison.I want the POA to agree to a reasonable and sustainable cost structure for the operation of our prisons and open centres. I want prison officers to continue to man Loughan House and Shelton Abbey. I want to move forward on the basis of consensus. If that is not possible, I will proceed, as soon as possible, with arrangements for the alternative management of the open centres and with the other measures I have outlined elsewhere. I will bring the prison officers there to places which at the moment require high overtime in order that the amount of overtime required to be worked will be reduced.The Prison Officers' Association has the power to create the circumstances in which its members can continue to have employment opportunities at open centres such as Shelton Abbey and Loughan House. The POA can choose to rule itself in or rule itself out of a role in open centres. It has, effectively, six weeks in which to make that choice. I am not making the choice for them, they will make the choice – I want everybody in the House and all local Deputies to understand clearly that it is their choice, and I will accept whatever solution they offer me.If they say we must continue with the overtime culture which prohibits places like Loughan house from being manned by prison officers, I will accept that and act accordingly, and staff it with other people. If, on the other hand, they say they will finally sit down and address the overtime culture with me, and ask in exchange that they continue to man Loughan House and Shelton Abbey, I will be the happiest Minister in the House and will accept them at their word. The Prison Officers' Association has power to make a decision. One thing I will make clear to both Cavan Deputies, and the Ceann Comhairle if it is of interest to him, is that Loughan House and Shelton Abbey will remain open centres whatever the prison officers choose.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	628	Having listened to the Minister, I am sure the Prison Officers Association will say, "Yes, Minister".I raise a serious matter here tonight. In the Ballinspittle area of County Cork Mr. Frank Collins has been on hunger strike since 10 September, 63 days. He was on hunger strikes previously, the longest of which lasted 33 days. He now consumes nothing other than Diet 7-Up and he is determined this time to see it through to the end.A considerable series of offences act as a background to this case. Undoubtedly, it is difficult to deal with this man in many ways. All the offences, as far as I can gather, are road traffic type offences which were dealt with in one form or another. Fines were mitigated eventually to €500. It is not really a matter of great seriousness in terms of the offences involved which has brought about this action. The offences are not serious in comparison with the danger of a man dying.The man feels aggrieved that his complaints, particularly regarding Garda treatment and harassment allegations he made, have not been dealt with seriously or in a satisfactory manner by the Garda Complaints Board. He is also particularly aggrieved that an investigation of incest was instigated against him. He has the following obsession at this point in time, that he has not received justice, no proper investigation took place, he is being harassed by the Garda, and he requires something substantial before he can come off the hunger strike.It seems that one solution would be that the Minister would intervene in the matter. That would be the ideal solution. Failing that, it seems he is determined to remain on hunger strike unless there is some commitment to an independent inquiry. I am sure the format that might take could be subject to some negotiation. His good friend, Mr. Edmund Butler, has been in considerable communication with various Ministers and Departments, both locally in the Cork area and, over the period of time, with the Minister – no doubt Mr. Butler would be a possible broker in this regard. Something would be required, however, in the present stalemate to avoid a tragedy, which could very well be the outcome of this hunger strike.I hope the Minister has some positive response on which we could build. It might be possible to bring some officer of the court into the picture, and there could be some acknowledgement by the Minister that the case would be looked at afresh and that some level of inquiry could be put in place. That could be communicated to the man, in consultation with his friend or friends, and we could try to get the matter resolved as quickly as possible.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am aware of this disturbing case. Tonight is not the first time it has been drawn to my attention. I have been aware of it, and following it closely, for a number of weeks.I am extremely concerned at reports that the person to whom the Deputy refers has been maintaining a hunger strike for such a lengthy period. I would urge all persons connected with this man to make every effort to persuade him to abandon, and not to pursue, this course of action given the severe consequences it may have for his health and the threat that it obviously poses to his very life.This most recent protest by the person in question follows a number of such protests over approximately the past three years. These protests have generally taken the form of hunger strikes and are, I understand, in response to alleged unfair treatment and harassment of him by a number of agencies, including, but not exclusively by any means, the Garda Síochána. Those allegations go back over a protracted period of time.During one of those protests a number of years ago, an official from my Department personally arranged to visit the man in question with the object of persuading him to have regard for his own safety and health, and following that meeting the person in question came off his hunger strike.On another occasion, in 2001, the person in question embarked on a further hunger strike which he ended following the intervention of an assistant commissioner of the Garda Síochána who undertook to inquire into the concerns that were central to his discontent and his protest.That inquiry, into wide-ranging allegations against many serving and retired members of the Garda Síochána, as well as staff and officials of Cork County Council, members of the legal profession and members of the Judiciary in Cork, concluded that there was no credible evidence to support and sustain his allegations.I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to disclose in the House details of the person's history of engagement with the courts and other agencies over a protracted period of time, but I do not accept the accuracy of the pen sketch of which the Deputy, obviously in good faith, has spoken. I appreciate that the Deputy must go on that available to him, but a different picture is evident on another view of the matter.The Deputy will appreciate that because of the separation of powers it is not possible for me, as Minister, to attempt to influence or second-guess the courts in the way they exercise their functions. In these circumstances, I very much regret that I am not in a position to offer this person any assistance where he is dissatisfied with the outcome of court proceedings.On his perceived difficulties with the Garda, I also understand that he has made a number of complaints to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, which is currently the appropriate body to deal with such matters. I am specifically precluded from intervening in complaints under the Complaints Board Act 1986, but I understand that he also contacted the Garda Commissioner and that the Garda authorities have conducted an extensive examination of all the issues of concern. Unfortunately the individual in question has been reluctant to interact with the Garda in its attempts to address his grievances.I am aware that the person's doctor and the Southern Health Board authorities are monitoring the situation.There is no doubt it is a very difficult case and it would be irresponsible of me to make some commitment, which in reality is not open to me. For my part, I would be prepared personally to consider fully any points which Deputy Costello – or any other person acting on behalf of the person in question – wishes to bring to my attention, but I cannot commit to more than that.I thank Deputy Costello for raising this matter in the Dáil. There are occasions when the job I have is hard, and these are the kind of occasions when it is particularly hard. In the circumstances – there have been a number of inquiries, the Garda Síochána Complaints Board undertook to examine some of his complaints but not others, and I understand the person in question was not content for it to do that – he insisted that all of his complaints would have to be examined, or none.I would ask Deputy Costello, the intermediary to whom he referred and other members of the European Parliament and this Dáil who have contacted me about this man, to intercede with him to give up the hunger strike, to end the danger to himself, to put his own life out of danger and to conserve his own health. If Deputy Costello wants me to look at any particular material which is new or which changes the situation, or of which he thinks I should know, I will be only too happy to do that but I cannot intervene in a way which has the effect of setting aside the rule of law in this case.The Dáil adjourned at 9.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 November 2003.

This represents an increase of €34 million or 5.7% above the 2002 outturn figure of approximately €595 million.The provision of funding for 2003 was decided having regard to the economic constraints and to the Government's commitments and priorities. In this regard it should be noted that from 1997 to 2003 there has been an increase of €297 million in the recurrent provision for the university sector as the grant increased from approximately €332 million in 1997 to approximately €629 million in 2003. This represents an increase of approximately 89% in this period.My Department spends more funding per student at third level that at the primary or post-primary levels. In 2002 these amounts were €3,766 at primary, €5,511 at post-primary and €7,127 at third level. The international comparisons of educational expenditure, published by the OECD, demonstrate that the balance of expenditure on education is more heavily skewed towards third level in Ireland, than in the majority of other OECD countries.

In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 118 together.My attention has been drawn to this report, A Teacher's Guide to the Reading Literacy Achievements of Irish 15-Year Olds, which was published last week by the Educational Research Centre. It concerns data on reading literacy collected in 2000 as part of the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA 2000. It reviews the outcomes of earlier national and international reports on PISA 2000 and presents some new analyses of these data from an Irish perspective.Only 3% of students performed below the lowest proficiency level, that is level 1. The OECD country average was 6% so we are well below that. Ireland performed well, with just four other OECD countries having fewer participating students who performed below level 1. I remind the Deputies of the overall high level of performance of Irish 15 year olds in the PISA 2000 assessment of reading literacy.

This development originated in my Department's recognition that students have a voice and a contribution to make to their school and these councils can play an integral and important role in the school community by providing a representative structure through which students can debate issues of concern and undertake initiatives of benefit to the school and the wider community.

Combating racism requires a multifaceted approach. The new curricula at primary and post-primary levels provide ample opportunity to extend students' awareness of the wider world and to learn about the lives and histories of people in other countries, and of their contributions to art and science. This is achieved particularly through the language, arts, religion, history, geography, music, business and home economics programmes and through the social education module of the leaving certificate applied course.In addition, the social, personal and health education programmes at primary and post-primary levels and the civic, social and political education programme at second level are designed to prepare students for participatory citizenship and to develop the skills of critical appraisal and decision-making based on human rights and social responsibilities. They also promote a respect for human dignity, tolerance for the values and beliefs of others and a celebration of diversity. Their format allows scope for teachers to deal with issues such as gender equity, racism and xenophobia, interculturalism and development education. In addition, many schools address the issue of racism in their religious education programmes.Arising from the report on promoting anti-racism and interculturalism, a range of additional resources and information materials have been made available for schools including videos, resource packs and guidelines for teachers.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	638	The Deputy will appreciate that the matter now under debate is a matter for the State Examinations Commission. However, the position is that inclusiveness and transparency are core principles underpinning the certificate examinations. I am of the view that the range of measures introduced since 2000 were appropriate and positive in the interest of enhancing the inclusiveness of the examination system. Under the new measures it is now open to special needs students to apply to have a part of an examination waived and to be marked out of 100% on the balance. In other words, a candidate being exempted from part of an examination will suffer no disadvantage and can obtain a top grade in that subject. This option was not available previously.The concept of using an explanatory note to enable such a development is one that is in use in many other jurisdictions where the special need or the nature of the arrangement provided is noted on the certificate. I consider that, by ensuring that the explanatory note is confined to a factual narrow statement on the assessment issues rather than a reference to the nature of the arrangement or the special need of the candidate, the model used here is better than employed elsewhere. This model does not categorise or label the candidate in any way because the explanatory note is confined to the assessment issue alone. The notation is presented as a positive statement. We use the format "all elements of the examinations were assessed except the xxxx element". Even though a candidate may have made known to us that he or she does not have the skill-competence under assessment in the national test instruments, we do not state that anywhere. Rather we state we were unable to assess it given the nature of the arrangement sought by the candidate. The core issue is the de facto exemption from an element of the standard assessment.It should be added that, in other jurisdictions, the examining authorities take the view that students with a specific learning difficulty should not be allowed any accommodation in language tests, such as assistance of a scribe, use of a tape recorder or spell check on a personal computer, on the basis that to do so is totally inconsistent with standard national assessment criteria. By contrast we not only allow the candidate such accommodations but also allow that candidate obtain full marks or avoid mark loss even though some of the marks are allocated to core assessment objectives such as spelling and grammar. This in our view represents a very positive discrimination for the candidates concerned.

Precise details of the annual operating costs will not be available until final decisions have been taken on the required level of specialist inputs involved in the various elements of the centre's activities. However, current estimates suggest an overall annual operating cost of approximately €2 million. No funding has been expended to date on the project.Proposals for the centre envisage the following: an educational assessment service for children and young people referred to the centre with a suspected or confirmed autistic spectrum disorder; a training and advisory service for teachers, other professionals and parents; an individual learning centre; an autism research, dissemination and information service; and residential accommodation with care staff.The proposed centre at Middletown will not replace any existing service provision for children with autism. Rather, it will complement existing services by providing specialist back-up support, advice and guidance on best practice to service providers North and South. The final terms of the purchase contract are currently under discussion with the owners of the facility.

The review arose following the receipt of applications for capital funding from the managerial authorities of all post-primary providers and against a backdrop of declining enrolments. The scope of the review was subsequently extended to include the five primary schools in the area. One of these schools, St. Catherine's Church of Ireland, has since closed.In view of the extent of the review, Dr. Tom McCarthy was appointed as a facilitator to consult with the local providers and to identify the key issues for primary and post-primary school provision in the area. His report is currently under consideration in my Department and his recommendations will assist in finalising the optimum strategy for educational provision in New Ross in the future.His report is also already being acted upon. I do not, however, intend to move unilaterally on this matter. The Deputy will agree that the scale of change potentially involved means that it is right and proper that the schools' trustees are consulted and that discussions should also involve both Kilkenny County Council and New Ross Town Council. Discussions, with the latter parties in particular, are necessary to ensure the greatest possible clarity regarding demographic changes and housing formation in the area that will inevitably impact on educational provision.While discussions have already taken place with both the trustees and the local authority officials, further dialogue is necessary before finalising the likely future shape of educational provision in New Ross.

Section 4 of the Act enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory, industrial, orphanages, children's homes and special schools, in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule.My Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. Discussions have taken place between my Department and other Departments that provided a regulatory function in the operation of these facilities to ascertain whether these institutions are in fact eligible for inclusion. The initial information received in some cases was scant due to the long period that had elapsed since these institutions were closed and therefore the process of verifying each of these institutions has been time-consuming.It is my intention that a list of additional institutions will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as the verification process is completed.

On consideration of these properties, officials at my Department informed CORI's legal representatives that the State was prepared in principle to accept 34 of the properties offered. These properties have been valued by the congregations at €22.6 million. Eight properties were rejected on the basis that no benefit to the State could be identified by acquiring a title while three properties are still under consideration.In view of the fact that the State rejected eight of the original properties, the congregations submitted a list of additional properties for the State to consider in June 2003. One of the congregations was not in a position to offer an alternative property and it decided to offer a cash sum equivalent instead. The amount being paid in cash by this congregation is €4 million, €2 million of which has already been received while the further €2 million will be paid in early 2004. The receipt of these cash payments reduces the value of the property to be transferred from €36.54 million to €32.54 million.Officials at my Department have considered the replacement properties offered and have informed CORI's legal representatives that the State was not in a position to benefit by acquiring a title to six of the properties concerned. The remaining six properties on this list are being considered by my Department and a decision will be conveyed to CORI's legal representatives in due course.I share the Deputy's concern that the property aspect of the indemnity agreement should be concluded as soon as possible. The Deputy will acknowledge that much progress has been made on the properties to be transferred since the agreement was signed in June 2002. However, as negotiations are ongoing and as the issue is commercially sensitive I do not intend to give details regarding the identity of the properties at this stage. However, when agreement has been concluded on this schedule, a list of the properties concerned will be made available.

It is intended that the plan will be implemented on a phased and prioritised basis as resources permit following agreement on financial provisions with the Minister for Finance.The plan includes a significant number of proposed actions of which five have been identified by the national youth work advisory committee as priorities. These are: the commencement of a national programme for child protection training for the youth work sector; the appointment of an assessor of youth work; the establishment of a development unit for youth work; the establishment of a funding review body, and the setting up of a validation body for youth work training.The commencement of a comprehensive child protection training programme for the youth work sector and the appointment of an assessor of youth work have been identified as priorities for year one of the plan and funding of €120,000 is available in 2003 towards these priorities.The national youth work advisory committee identified the appointment of a project manager as an important first step in the commencement of a child protection training programme and the National Youth Council of Ireland is in the process of recruiting an appropriately qualified person to this post. Arrangements for the appointment of an assessor of youth work under the terms of the Youth Work Act 2001 are in train by my Department.

The committee is responsible for advising me on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage.The committee, which is chaired by Professor Áine Hyland, vice-president and professor of education, University College Cork, is based on an expert rather than a representational model. To facilitate participation by a wider range of educational partners, as well as bodies and agencies active in tackling social exclusion, it was also decided to set up a larger forum to address educational disadvantage.The educational disadvantage forum, which met for the first time in November 2002, was attended by approximately 240 delegates drawn from a wide range of interests. A report of the forum proceedings was published in March 2003 and will inform the work of the educational disadvantage committee.One of my key concerns in tackling disadvantage is to improve the level of integration between the various educational disadvantage programmes operated by my Department. In this regard, I have requested the committee to undertake a root and branch review of all of the programmes to ensure optimum synergy and integration between them. The committee is engaged in this review.The report on teacher supply and staffing in disadvantaged settings, which was submitted to me by the educational disadvantage committee, is under consideration at present.

It was also designed to provide options for my consideration to promote greater equity in access to and participation in higher education.The Deputy will be aware that I announced on 25 May 2003 a €42 million support package for disadvantaged students in higher education. In constructing this package of measures, I had regard to the various policy options outlined in chapter four of the report which were developed on the basis of their potential to improve equity of access to higher education.

It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels. My objective is to ensure that all young people leave the education system with a high quality education and related qualifications to support their full participation in society and in the economy.My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government's National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion, 2003-05, NAPSincl, and the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative focused on literacy, numeracy and early school leavers.I fully recognise the importance of early intervention as a means of preventing future educational disadvantage and, at pre-school level, my Department continues to support a number of early intervention programmes, including the Early Start project which caters for pupils aged three to four years who are most at risk in areas of social disadvantage.

In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place.Primary schools are given an annual allocation of €3,809 plus €12.70 per pupil under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to the school infrastructure. In addition, my Department has set aside a contingency sum of €8.7 million at primary level and €2 million at post-primary level to deal with emergency works, including emergency health and safety works, during 2003.Responsibility for the maintenance of schools is also a matter for the managerial authorities of primary and voluntary secondary schools, which are privately owned. Per capita grants towards the operating costs of primary and voluntary secondary schools may be used for this purpose. Per capita grants have been increased significantly in recent years.I am on record as acknowledging that the significant levels of investment made in school buildings in recent years need to be maintained going forward if the goal of eliminating sub-standard accommodation is to be achieved. To that end and in the context of the Estimates process, I am seeking to put in place a multi-annual capital funding envelope for the next four to five years.I consider that the provision of such an envelope for the school building programme will enable my Department to provide greater clarity for all education partners concerning the progress of projects within the programme.

These recommendations were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year.Following a review early in 2002, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to €4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and to €1,600 for students residing within 15 miles of college. As a result of the review, it was expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002-03 would double to 7,000 students. Recent figures show that this target was exceeded with approximately 8,000 students receiving the top-up grant in 2002-03.

To assist in the planning and delivery of services, my Department is at present developing a database of pupils with special educational needs. In that regard, a census form recently issued information in regard to all pupils with special educational needs.There are approximately 500 special classes attached to mainstream primary schools. These classes cater for an estimated 4,000 pupils. Some 108 special schools cater for approximately 6,000 pupils. This pupil cohort is entitled to an enhanced capitation grant. A significant number of pupils avail of the following supports in mainstream schools on an integrated basis. The number of learning support teachers in the primary school system has increased from 1,302 in 1998 to 1,531. The annual salary cost of these teachers is approximately €54 million. The number of resource teachers has increased from 104 in 1998 to more than 2,300. The annual salary cost of these teachers is estimated at more than €70 million. The number of special needs assistants has grown from 300 in 1998 to 4,239 full-time and a further 1,264 part-time posts. The annual salary cost of this service is estimated at €100 million for 2003.The allocation for part-time tuition services for children with special needs has been increased from €12 million in 2002 to €19 million in 2003. The allocation for school transport in 2003 is €97.5 million, which is an increase of 18.5% on last year's allocation. Almost 30% of the budget for school transport is being expended to facilitate the transport requirements of between 9,000 and 10,000 children with special needs at an average cost of €3,300 per pupil. Approximately €4.4 million is spent annually on the school transport escort service. Funding towards special equipment has increased from €635,000 in 1998 to €3.26 million in 2003.

Abbott handed down judgment in the application by the Christian Brothers to the High Court on 17 October 2003. The High Court found that the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 is not unconstitutional and that the investigation committee of the commission could operate in the manner outlined in the Act.The judgment is as yet unapproved and therefore the 21 day period during which an appeal to the Supreme Court must be made has not yet commenced. This period will only commence when the perfected judgment is issued. I have always taken the view that, in the context of the review of the work of the investigation committee, it would be prudent to await the final outcome of this case. I still believe that this is the case. Should the case be appealed to the Supreme Court, the Government has already stated that it will take all steps necessary to expedite the process.In regard to the review being undertaken by Mr. Seán Ryan SC, I am aware that Mr. Ryan is progressing this matter and I would expect that he will complete his task soon. If it is the case that Mr. Ryan's report indicates a need to give additional powers to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, this will be considered by Government and, if appropriate, will be included in the amending legislation that I will bring forward.

It is administered by my Department and provides funding to students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions and, since 1998, in post-leaving certificate centres. The purpose of the fund is to provide students with serious physical and-or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.Under the social inclusion measures in the national development plan, there is provision for a third level access fund totalling almost €121 million over the period 2000 to 2006 aimed at tackling under-representation by a number of target groups including students with a disability. The report of the action group on access to third level education, which was established to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation by the target groups, was published in 2001.Provision for the fund for students with disabilities has increased from €101,579 in 1994 to €3,737,700 in 2002 which is at a level more than double that recommended in the action group's report. The number of beneficiaries has also increased significantly, from 314 in 1999 to 1,058 in 2002. New applications to the fund in respect of the 2003-04 academic year are being processed.In addition to the fund, between 1996 and 2002, as part of its targeted initiative funding programme, the Higher Education Authority has allocated more than €5.5 million towards activities focused on supporting increased access for students with a disability. Among the activities funded have been the employment of specialist staff, the training of academic and non-academic staff, the establishment of units for provision of assistive technology training and support for students and staff, careers support for students with a disability, pre-entry outreach and taster programmes and post-entry orientation and support. The Higher Education Authority also continues to provide capital funding to assist colleges in making existing buildings and facilities universally accessible.With regard to participation by students with a disability in third level education, it is estimated by AHEAD, the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability, that there are some 1,800 students with a disability in third level institutions this year as against some 450 in 1994, a significant increase.A key recommendation of the action group on access to third level education was that a national office for equity of access to higher education should be established in the Higher Education Authority to facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the target groups in partnership with the Department of Education and Science, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.

The terms of the higher education grants scheme and the VEC scholarship scheme for the 2003-04 academic year provide that the local authorities and vocational education committees shall pay the maintenance grant in three equal instalments as early as possible in each term and the individual payable orders shall be addressed to the grant holder care of the bursar's office of the college.A survey of the 66 local authorities and vocational education committees in the current academic year indicates that 63 have paid the first instalment of the grant, with the exception of some cases where they are awaiting further information from applicants or where late applications were accepted. The remaining awarding bodies expect to make payments shortly.

Up until the 1999-2000 school year, principals were released from teaching duties to become an administrative principal where the school had a staffing of eight or more mainstream class teachers. From the commencement of the 2000-01 school year, administrative principals were appointed to ordinary schools with seven mainstream class teachers. In addition, schools with a lesser number of mainstream class teachers but with 11 or more teachers when ex-quota posts were counted were allowed appoint an additional teacher to facilitate the release of the principal from teaching duties to become an administrative principal. Since the 2002-03 school year, administrative principals may be appointed to such schools where there are nine or more teachers when ex-quota posts are counted.The scheme of release time for principals was also introduced for the 2000-01 school year. This scheme enables teaching principals of primary schools to be released from their teaching duties for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative, leadership and management functions. The number of days' release time granted is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school as outlined in primary circular 25/02. Paid substitution is approved by my Department for the days that principals are on release time.Arising from the implementation of the PCW agreement, significant improvements were introduced to the management structure of primary schools through the allocation of additional posts of responsibility. It is a matter for the boards of management of schools to delegate functions to the posts of responsibility holders. My Department is engaged in the development of a computerised on-line system for the submission of claims for the payment of certain categories of teachers. Work on this project has formally commenced and the implementation of this system is expected to further assist principal teachers in the performance of their administrative duties.My Department is involved in ongoing discussion with teachers' representatives concerning the conditions of service of primary teachers.

The level of resources being made available to support students with special educational needs in the second level system has been substantially increased for the current school year and will involve the allocation of approximately 300 additional whole-time equivalent teacher posts and 75 additional special needs assistant posts. To date, a total of approximately 920 whole-time equivalent resource teacher posts and 435 whole-time equivalent special needs assistant posts have been allocated to the second level system. These resources support approximately 10,600 students with special educational needs at second level.All applications for special support services must be considered on the basis of the professionally assessed needs of the individual students involved. The nature and level of the response provided is based on the advice of the National Educational Psychological Service. I am aware that, due to unforeseen circumstances, some delays arose in the processing of applications for special support services for a limited period earlier this year. However, I am satisfied that measures introduced by my Department have resolved this difficulty and that the great majority of applications for special support services have now been addressed.The measures proposed in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 will copperfasten the rights and entitlements of pupils with special needs to an appropriate education service. It will also bring much needed clarity to the roles and responsibilities of the various bodies charged with the development and delivery of such services, including schools. I am satisfied that the necessary resources will be available to support the measures in question, including those required at the level of the individual school.

To date, my Department has allocated a total of 3.35 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants at post-primary level in County Wexford. Approval for the position of special needs assistant is granted by my Department. The post is sanctioned to help cater for the special needs of pupils and is subject to review in light of their emerging needs. Each individual school authority is responsible for the employment of special needs assistants.

Following a review of budgetary provision for 2003 across the range of further education programmes and supports, it has been found possible to re-designate certain elements of funding to enable supplementary grants to be allocated for child care. Vocational education committees were asked to indicate their minimal requirements to maintain the service and this information is being received in my Department. Supplementary allocations will be issued to the vocational education committees in question on foot of the revised information.

I am anxious in the first instance to ensure that all existing allocations are fully justified and do not involve any excess provision before I determine the precise measures necessary across the sector and the rate at which the target reduction is achieved over the next two years. Therefore, I cannot at this point say what implications there will be for the pupil-teacher ratio in any one sector. Tight financial control within the context of the 2004 Estimates provision is likely to have implications for the capacity to maintain existing numbers in some institutions within the sector.

The commission has a dual structure to meet the differing needs of victims. On the one hand, there is the investigation committee which hears witnesses who wish to make specific allegations of abuse and see their evidence investigated by the committee. There is also the confidential committee which hears in total confidence the testimony of witnesses who do not wish their allegations to be inquired into.The legal costs incurred to date by the State amount to €4,102,706.47. These costs do not include the costs of individual hearings before the investigation committee which have yet to be determined. When I commenced the review of the investigation committee of the commission, there was a concern that, were no such review to take place, substantial legal fees, estimated at €200 million, could be incurred, the vast bulk of which would be payable to persons against whom complaints have been made before the investigation committee.The Government appointed Mr. Seán Ryan SC as chairperson designate of the commission on 26 September 2003. Mr. Ryan has been requested to undertake his own independent review of the commission's work and make recommendations, having regard to the interest of victims of abuse, the completion of the commission's work within a reasonable timeframe and in a manner consistent with a proper investigation and to achieve the aforementioned objectives without incurring exorbitant costs. I expect the outcome of the review shortly.

Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of voluntary secondary schools which are privately owned. Per capita grants towards the operating costs of voluntary secondary schools may be used for this purpose.There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. The standard per capita grant now amounts to €266.49, as against the rate of €224.74 which applied in 1997. For disadvantaged schools, the increase has brought the per capita grant to more than €300. In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of €25 per pupil, which was introduced for second level schools in September 2000, was increased to €89 per pupil from September 2002 and was further increased by €10 per pupil from January last to €99 per pupil.

Arising from this report, the Comptroller and Auditor General recommended the creation of a prioritisation system for school building projects, a matter to which he again refers in his recently published report.Following the 1996 study, my Department initially explored prioritisation systems used in other jurisdictions and discussed the matter with a broad range of interested parties. Subsequently, my Department engaged an external professional consultant, Professor Pignatelli, to assist in the drafting of a robust transparent prioritisation system. Professor Pignatelli's report formed the basis of the prioritisation system that has been put in place within my Department.In framing his report, Professor Pignatelli conducted an extensive consultative process with all of the education partners during which it was pointed out to him that an inflexible and mechanistic application of a predetermined points system could inhibit freedom to articulate the legitimacy and compelling circumstances of a case and restrict the Department's discretion to respond in appropriate situations.Professor Pignatelli further reported that many of the parties with whom he consulted recognised that, no matter how objective and scientific criteria for prioritising projects might be, the need for decision makers to exercise their professional and-or technical judgment at some point in the process would remain. This was seen as the inevitable consequence of the fact that all bids for support in a national system have to be considered in the context of national priorities and policies, the availability of funding and the complex technical considerations inherent in many project proposals. Professor Pignatelli, having studied these views, did not recommend a points based system.The prioritisation system used in my Department classifies projects by reference to a range of well-established and well-defined categories. Within these categories, projects are assigned to an appropriate band of priority, of which there are four, with band one being the highest priority and band four being the lowest. I published the criteria used to decide the banding systems when I took the unprecedented step of publishing the 2003 school building programme earlier this year. When shaping a programme, those projects that command the highest priority banding within their respective categories are considered for inclusion. Also published in the 2003 school building programme are the criteria used to select within bands as may occur when resources do not permit the implementation of all equivalent banded projects.

At primary level an entire new school has been provided at Killashee while temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corbáin in Naas and at one of the two nearby national schools at Caragh.At Sallins boys' national school, proposals for a seven-classroom extension are at an advanced stage of architectural planning. When delivered, this extension will increase capacity at the school from nine to 16 classrooms. Likewise, plans for a new 16 classroom school together with a double autistic unit for Naas town are at an advanced stage of planning. This latter project will, in particular, assist in easing any difficulties for primary pupil places that may exist in Naas. Additionally, there are proposals to revamp accommodation at St. David's national school, at Kill national school and at Two Mile House national school. The accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Caragh and Convent of Mercy in Naas are also being assessed.At post-primary level, surplus capacity exists at St. Patrick's post-primary school. The school's management authority, County Kildare VEC, is assessing the future of the school at its existing location. A major extension project has been completed at St. Mary's College which has increased capacity at the school to 800 pupils. A further application for additional accommodation at the school is being assessed. A major extension at Meánscoil Iognáid Rís is in architectural planning.I assure the Deputy that the school planning section of my Department will keep the position in the general Naas area under review.

Tackling this complex issue has been my number one priority since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science. It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels. My objective is to ensure that all young people leave the education system with a high quality education and related qualifications to support their full participation in society and in the economy.My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government's National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion, 2003-05, NAPSincl, and the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative focused on literacy, numeracy and early school leavers. Some €460 million is being provided by my Department in 2003 for programmes specifically designed to tackle educational disadvantage in accordance with the strategies outlined in the NAPSincl and Sustaining Progress. This includes provision for programmes at pre-school, primary and post-primary levels as well as provision for the youth sector, further education measures and programmes designed to broaden access to third level for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.As well as targeting resources at those schools with the highest concentration of disadvantaged pupils, my Department also supports initiatives specifically designed to help alleviate the costs of education for parents living in disadvantaged areas. To this end, I have provided more than €10 million in 2003 for the book grant scheme which will benefit more than 270,000 pupils in disadvantaged areas. This initiative is complemented by the schools meals scheme and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance which are operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.

Accordingly, applicants must satisfy the Department of Education and Science that they are competent to teach the Irish language and to teach the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.Teachers qualified outside the State may be given recognition to teach in primary schools. Once their qualifications have been assessed and accepted by the Department they may be granted provisional recognition to commence teaching in mainstream primary schools or restricted recognition to teach only in special schools or classes where Irish is not a curricular requirement.

The position is that in 1999 the board of management applied to my Department for a new school. Following examination of the application it was agreed that accommodation should be provided for a six teacher school.A subsequent technical inspection of the existing school and site was carried out and a recommendation was made that a new school on a greenfield site should be provided. The Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in procurement of sites, was asked to investigate and report on suitable sites for the proposed new school. While a number of sites have been identified, investigations in this regard have yet to be completed.The purchase of a site and advancement of the school's building project to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary provision for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress of existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects.Funding of €48,000 towards temporary accommodation was provided to St. Brendan's national school under the 2003 capital programme and in 2002 my Department grant aided the purchase of two portable structures which had been rented at the school.

It contains approximately 180 individual recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates and early intervention, through issues on diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services and the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues.The scope of these recommendations is such as to require a multi-faceted response. My Department's key focus to date has been on progressing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with autism in line with the task force's recommendations. These measures will be fundamental to the implementation of many of the task force's recommendations.A key development on the structural front has been the decision to establish the National Council for Special Education. The national council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including persons with autism. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. A chief executive has been appointed, the Oireachtas has approved an order establishing the council and the recruitment of council staff is in hand.I have also published the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 aimed at establishing the rights and entitlements of children with special needs, including autism, to an appropriate education service and providing the necessary framework for effective service delivery. My objective is to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	680	I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to inform the House of the factual position relating to this issue. In April 2002, my predecessor published, on the Department's website, a list of school building projects which were to be progressed as part of the 2002 school building programme. This list of intended projects was based on a revised budget allocation of €172.64 million for primary school buildings and €171.73 million for post-primary schools. One of the crucial aspects of managing a multi-million euro annual capital programme is the timing of allowing projects to proceed to tender and construction. Some projects were scheduled to proceed to tender and construction in early 2002 and others were scheduled for later in the year. A substantial number of projects proceeded through design and on to construction. However, it became clear in late 2002 that the funding allocation for 2003 might be less than anticipated. On this basis, it was prudent, therefore, not to proceed in late 2002 with the projects intended to go to tender and construction and to defer consideration of these projects until funding for 2003 was certain.The publication of the Estimates in November 2002 detailed the 2003 funding allocation of €147.7 million for primary capital projects. Subsequently, I reallocated €20 million from within my overall departmental budget to increase the funding available to €167.7 million. The allocation for post-primary capital projects for 2003 was €175.2 million. The 2003 school building programme was based on these allocations.I understand the frustration felt by schools which believed that their project would proceed to tender and construction in late 2002 and early 2003 and subsequently did not. However, Deputies will understand that I could only allow projects advance within the funding available for capital projects at primary and post-primary level.

In the five years up to and including 2002, a total of €1,248 million was spent by my Department on primary and post-primary school buildings. This is a very significant investment. The Government remains committed to continuing this work and to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time.To ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools, my Department has undertaken, on a pilot basis, a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The information gained from the survey will be placed on a geographic information system, GIS, database. My Department is at present undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase of the inventory to determine the exact nature and extent of the nationwide survey.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	684	In 1999 the Hardiman review group recommended the construction of a 5,400 sq. m. extension to the Cork School of Music. The estimated cost of providing for the extension under traditional procurement was circa €15 million. This figure was the basic estimated cost of the extension and did not take into account the cost of design and planning, loose furniture and fittings, equipment including musical instruments and information technology, or the maintenance and operation of the school over the proposed 25 year contract. All these items are included under the proposed PPP project and are reflected in the cost.During the PPP procurement process, the project scope changed as it became clear that the fabric of the existing school of music building had deteriorated significantly. It had deteriorated to such an extent that the cost of restoration, refurbishment and remodelling would be poor value for money and the only option available was for its demolition and replacement with an entirely new building. Therefore, the current net present value cost of the project at €100 million, capital cost €62.9 million, provides for the demolition of the existing building and its replacement with a new building that will include the additional area proposed in the Hardiman report, allow the amalgamation of all 17 venues currently used by the school in a single location, the cost of design and planning, all fittings, furniture and equipment, the cost of operating and maintaining the school for 25 years and the cost of servicing the financing of the project over that period.I am satisfied that the current estimated cost of this PPP project properly reflects the actual costs of providing a fully equipped and serviced school of music. However, as the Deputy will be aware, issues surrounding the effect of the project on the general Government balance and its affordability in the context of the current economic climate are currently being examined.

Under PSV regulations, the licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on a ratio of three pupils for every two adult seats. Safety on school transport is of paramount importance to my Department and Bus Éireann, which operates the scheme on behalf of my Department. Great care is taken to ensure loading does not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity of the different bus types in use.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	687	Unqualified teachers should only be employed in primary schools in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted. The primary sector has experienced a shortage of trained teachers in recent years, mainly as a result of the large number of posts created to reduce class sizes, to cater for pupils in disadvantaged areas and to provide for those with special educational needs. The difficulties experienced are aggravated by the number of teachers availing of career break and jobsharing schemes. My Department has introduced a range of measures to address the current shortage of qualified teachers and is also examining further options for addressing the teacher supply issue in consultation with relevant interests.Since 1999, more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B. Ed. programme in the colleges of education. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996. The total intake in the 2002-03 academic year was approximately 1,350 students. This compares to an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently 3,500 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education.I have recently announced that I will be prepared to recognise graduates of a new primary teacher training course for the purposes of primary teaching. The new course is being accredited by HETAC and it will be delivered by Hibernia College, an on-line third level educational company using innovative on-line elearning technology. It will lead to a graduate diploma in primary education. The course will be open to graduates and, in addition to its on-line component, will involve face-to-face tuition delivered at regional locations.It is important also to acknowledge that the colleges of education have done much to increase the output of primary teachers to meet the needs of schools arising from significant additional teacher allocations in recent years. My Department is examining the need for a further postgraduate course to be provided by the colleges of education and is in contact with the colleges in this regard. In addition to increasing the output of graduates, other initiatives have been introduced to increase the number of trained personnel. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications are recognised as fully qualified.Montessori-trained teachers who have successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by HETAC, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the AMI College, are recognised as fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools, special classes and as resource teachers in primary schools.

Since that time, the number of psychologists has increased almost three-fold, with 127 psychologists serving with NEPS, including seven new entrants who took up duty since the beginning of this year. Further recruitment of psychologists to NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and Government policy on public sector numbers. I have also allocated funding to NEPS to allow for the commissioning of psychological assessments from private practitioners. The scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, is an interim measure, aimed at providing a service to schools that do not yet have access to the psychological service provided by NEPS.

The ERSI considered that the measure was important but noted that there was a need to justify a continuation of the rate of investment achieved in 2000 to 2002 in light of demographic change.The Deputy will be aware that I have been in discussions with my colleague the Minister for Finance to secure a multi-annual capital envelope for educational infrastructure. In these discussions, I have articulated the rationale for a continuation of the programme of sustained capital investment in educational infrastructure begun in recent years. This rationale centres on the need to address the historical deficit situation as well as meeting emerging demands in rapidly developing areas and addressing the needs for diversity within the system.

The final report was completed in April 2003. The recommendations in the report are wide-ranging and encompass proposals that extend beyond PLC provision, including issues which impact on the shaping of structures for the delivery of further and adult education into the future, and on other sectors of the education system. During October 2003, officials in my Department held discussions with both the management side and staff representative interests in the sector to consider the recommendations and areas of common interest. This consultation process is ongoing.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	698	The reported historical animal health problems in the Askeaton area were the subject of a multiagency investigation, in which the EPA, Teagasc, the Mid-Western Health Board and the Department of Agriculture and Food participated. The investigation was co-ordinated by the EPA.In the course of the investigation the EPA published a number of interim reports and the final report of this most comprehensive and in-depth investigation was published by the EPA in August 2001. The investigation was based on scientific evidence and specialist expertise from various quarters was brought to bear on analyses of animal health, human health and environmental issues in the Askeaton area. The details of all the relevant animal health studies and laboratory tests are presented in chapter 3 of the main report of the investigations of animal health problems in that area, which constitutes part of the final report.The EPA examined the aluminium and fluoride concentrations in milk samples from certain farms in the area and the results of these examinations are contained in the interim report published in 1995. Bone is the main repository for accumulation of these elements and consequently meat samples were not examined in this regard. The Department of Agriculture and Food looked at aluminium and fluoride concentrations in bones of animals from Askeaton farms and the results, the values of which were within acceptable ranges, are contained in chapter three of the final report. It should also be noted that the EPA and Teagasc looked at the aluminium and fluoride concentrations in a range of vegetables from the area and results were also within acceptable ranges.As indicated previously the overall conclusion of the study, as published in the final report, was that there was no evidence that animal health or production on any of the participating farms were subject to unusual adverse influences during the periods of observation. The incidence of disease was generally within acceptable limits and no serious disease outbreaks were encountered. These results, together with those of the other studies that comprised the Askeaton investigations, provide no evidence to suggest that animal health problems in the Askeaton area were significantly different to those of other comparable farming areas in Ireland.

At an inspection of his herd on 3 July 2002 it was found that 18 unclaimed animals were not compliant with identification and registration requirements. The herdowner was informed that because clause 38 of the terms and conditions of the scheme had been contravened a resultant penalty would apply to his premia payments. He was also informed that he could seek a review of this decision. He has been in regular contact by telephone with the district livestock office of my Department and on 3 September 2003 a written request was received from him seeking a review. The results of the review will issue to the herdowner shortly.The person named is also an applicant under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme. In processing his claim for premium for 38 animals an initial check showed a number of tags with queries that required further clarification. Correspondence regarding these matters issued to the herdowner on 9 August 2003. Following his reply of 12 September 2003, there are still a number of outstanding issues to be resolved. The district livestock office of my Department is in contact with the applicant with a view to having his suckler cow 2003 claim processed further.

However, in the past, and in the context of a regime which prohibited the sale of breeding and commercial stock from affected flocks, my Department from time to time made ex gratia payments in respect of the depopulation of sheep to pedigree flockowners whose primary business was constrained by such restriction. In this context, and having received the views of farmer representative bodies, my Department is at present considering the question of making similar ex gratia payments to the flockowners in question. I expect that my Department will be in a position to issue letters of offer to those concerned very soon. I do not believe that there is a basis for paying compensation in respect of commercial flocks; nor do I envisage establishing a scheme of compensation for claimed income loss.

Agreement was reached on these proposals on 31 October and they are now fully in place. Some cost savings will arise in 2003 by virtue of the agreement. Next year will be the first full year of operation under the new agreement and I expect that the efficiencies and flexibilities now provided for will be reflected in budget savings in my Department's Vote.The new agreement replaces the old single shift arrangement with an extensive and variable menu of TVI shifts which can be selected to match the operations of individual plants. Payment will in future be based on a new hourly rate calculated pro rata to the former rate, and the agreement provides for a prominent and direct role for factories in rostering. In future, the allocation of resources to plants in respect of the TVI service will be set on an annual basis.Cost of TVIs 1995-2002

It would take a number of weeks to manually compile the information for the period 1995 to 2001.In 2002 there were ten officers at management level involved in beef carcase classification. The number of classifiers operating at factory level in 2002 was 57.

The decision that the Department should withdraw from providing this service is based on the principle that a Departmental permanent presence in meat plants should be confined to areas where regulatory responsibility is vested in it, as the competent authority. The only regulatory responsibility arising for it in respect of carcase classification is of a supervisory nature and my Department will continue to carry out this function.Following withdrawal from carcase classification duties the staff concerned will carry out other necessary functions where there is a shortage of staff resources. Agreement has been reached with the IMPACT trade union in relation to redeployment arrangements. In the meantime training of factory operatives, delivered free of charge by my Department, is currently in progress. This will enable factory operatives to be trained to the appropriate standard and enable them to provide continuity of service when the Department classifiers are withdrawn. At that stage my Department will provide intensive supervision of the grading process, in line with the systems operated in 13 other EU member states.

My Department has been in contact with the FSAI concerning the issues raised in the IFA report with a view to ensuring compliance with EU beef labelling requirements.Where there is evidence that these requirements are not being met, then the agency responsible for controlling the particular sector and for implementing the legislation should take the appropriate action. In relation to the beef slaughtering and cutting plants under the control of my Department, I have asked the Department's veterinary inspectorate to examine the procedures in place to ensure full compliance. It is a matter for the FSAI, in conjunction with the local authorities and health boards, to address any alleged breaches in the retail and catering sectors and I understand the FSAI is following up the matters raised.

In these meetings the Commission officials have indicated that any formal request for further classification could lead to a demand for justification of Ireland's current designation and classification for all disadvantaged areas. The Commission's approach has its basis in negative comments by the Court of Auditors concerning the monitoring of disadvantaged area classification and designation in the EU in general.Given this background, it is important that the timing and nature of any submission requesting extension of the disadvantaged areas be given very careful consideration. An independent evaluation of all CAP rural development plan measures including the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowances scheme has recently been completed. My Department will be formally submitting the evaluation report to the European Commission following the meeting of the CAP rural development plan monitoring committee later this month. In the context of the Commission's consideration of this report, I expect to have a further opportunity to raise the issue of disadvantaged areas classification with the European Commission.

I emphasise, however, that other than this, the Office of Public Works has no responsibility in relation to the matter.The question of repairing damage to infrastructure as a result of the landslides and protesting properties and infrastructure in the event that further landslides occur is a matter for consideration by Mayo County Council in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.It is a fundamental requirement that in order to obtain the tax concessions available under the scheme, the applicant must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of the required certificate is refused, this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for tax relief without the issue of a valid primary medical certificate. I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not aware of any instances where entry to the scheme was granted to blind persons who did not otherwise qualify for the scheme.

Provision for the youth work sector increased by almost 60% from 1997 to 2003 which demonstrates the Government's commitment to supporting the work of the youth sector. I do not, therefore, accept that there is a serious financial shortfall in the sector as the cumulative increase since 1997 has been very significant and well ahead of inflation over that period of time.I am conscious of the issues and concerns being raised by the National Youth Council of Ireland regarding future funding for ongoing youth work programmes and services and further implementation of the Youth Work Act 2001 and the national youth work development plan 2003-2007. The figure of €5 million referred to by the council relates to these activities. The question of additional funding for the youth sector will be dealt with in the 2004 Estimates process. I might point out that of its nature, the Youth Work Act 2001 has to be implemented on an incremental basis.

The application is being examined at present in the school planning section of my Department and when completed, a decision in this matter will be conveyed to the management authority.The need for a new primary school in the general Stepaside area has already been identified. The local authority has reserved a site for the proposed new school in the context of the Stepaside action area plan. A formal notification of intention to apply for the recognition of a new school in the area, to commence operation in September 2004, has been received from the Dublin Archdiocese. The application will be referred to the new schools' advisory committee for its consideration. The committee will make its recommendations to me in this matter at a later stage.The matter of acquiring sites for both the proposed new school and the existing all-Irish primary school in the area will be considered in the context of the 2004 school building programme.

The Government accepted the report of the commission, in principle, in September 2001 and also decided to establish a joint working group with the public services committee of ICTU to examine and report on the implementation of the commission's recommendations. The working group has completed its work and has recently reported. The recommendations of the pensions commission and the report of the working group are being considered by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who has overall responsibility for public service pensions policy. Pending the outcome of those considerations, there will be no change in the age limits for retirement nor in the early retirement provisions applicable to certain categories of public servants.

It serves as a national centre for research on all aspects of language, language behaviour, language learning and language teaching, with special reference to Irish and involving English and modern European languages.In recent years a value for money study and an independent consultancy study have made recommendations in relation to the reorganisation of the institute's activities. My Department has had discussions with representatives of the executive committee of the company in relation to their future intentions, having regard to a number of operational issues. The operation of the company is a matter for the members in accordance with their memorandum and articles of association.At an extraordinary general meeting of the company held on 18 July 2003 the company agreed to initiate a process of voluntary liquidation. My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its future intentions, in partnership with the staff of the institute. This will include arrangements for ensuring the continuation of the research functions previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate redeployment or other appropriate arrangements for permanent staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance. I have asked to be kept informed of progress.I understand that, since January 2000, some €92,000 has been expended by ITE on legal fees. I understand that there are two legal actions outstanding against the institute.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	732	Provision of educational psychological assessments is part of the work of the educational psychologists in the national educational psychological service, NEPS. The NEPS does not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment in the sense of lists of names that are dealt with in chronological order. Such details are kept by the schools.Each psychologist is responsible for a number of named schools, and visits each on a regular basis. The NEPS psychologists provide advice on the identification and screening of children who might need to be assessed. The school authorities keep a note of children who are giving cause for concern and discuss the relative urgency of each case during the psychologist's visits. This allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and such children will be seen or referred on in a matter of weeks, if not days.  Where cases are less urgent, the psychologist will, as a preliminary measure, act as a consultant to teachers and parents, offer advice about educational and behavioural plans and monitor progress.Pending the expansion of the NEPS to all schools in the country, my Department has allocated funding for schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS service to commission psychological assessments from private practitioners. The NEPS has issued details of how to avail of this scheme to all schools. There have been concerns in the past that some children may have been referred to more than one agency, thus increasing the numbers of children waiting to be assessed in schools and in health board clinics, and leading to a duplication of effort. A joint working party, established by the NEPS and the health boards, reported during 2002 with a series of recommendations aimed at promoting effective liaison at national, regional and local level. This report has been accepted by the relevant management groups and will now be implemented. It includes recommendations for effective protocols in relation to referrals and waiting lists.

As a rule primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.As the children have a level of service within guidelines, and an extension-rerouting of service would involve additional cost, the present arrangement is the most that can be offered by my Department.

An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.The annual higher education grants scheme which I approve sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. The approved institutions mainly comprise the publicly funded third level institutions.There are no plans to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private third level institutions. Any extension to the scope of the maintenance grants scheme, to include students attending private third level institutions, can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.However, tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, is available on tuition fees paid to certain approved private third level institutions in respect of approved third level courses.

In the five years up to and including 2002, my Department has spent €1,248 million on primary and post-primary school buildings. This is a very significant investment. The Government remains committed to continuing this work and to consolidating the substantial progress that has already been made to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time.To ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools, my Department has undertaken on a pilot basis a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The information gained from the survey will be placed on a geographic information system database. My Department is undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase of the inventory to determine the exact nature and extent of the nationwide survey.

The number of teacher posts being made available to support students with special educational needs at second level in the current school year represents an increase of approximately 300 posts on 2002-03. Additional special support services are being made available on an ongoing basis in response to identified needs.

There is no requirement for individual school management authorities to report to my Department on instances of bullying. However, I am very aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has moved to tackle the issue on a number of fronts.The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. The social, personal and health education programme is part of the curriculum in every primary school at present and is also a mandatory component of the junior cycle in all second level schools. The content of the programme reflects current best practice in the area of educating children in relation to bullying.As part of school development planning, schools are advised to have stated policies and to develop plans on discipline, health and safety and countering bullying behaviour. Parental involvement in the planning process is encouraged. Through their representation on the board of management and through parents' associations, parents can readily be consulted in the clarification and development of these policies and plans.

At primary level the ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 18:1 in the 2002-03 school year. At second level the ratio has fallen from 16:1 to 13.6:1 in the same period. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to work towards further reductions in pupil-teacher ratios within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas.

In particular, important progress has been made in regard to curricular reform and inservice support, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology and physics and chemistry, revised syllabi in primary science and junior certificate science beginning in schools in 2003-04, and work under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus. All these developments are being or have been supported by national inservice programmes for teachers. Three days' inservice was provided for all primary teachers to support the implementation of the primary science programme, supported by a national team of 24 trainers. Some 1,700 second level biology teachers, 900 chemistry teachers and 1,000 physics teachers received inservice for the leaving certificate revised syllabi, and a national programme is now being implemented for the revised junior certificate science syllabus.

To that end, in the context of the estimates process, I am seeking to put in place a multiannual capital funding envelope for the next four to five years. I consider that the provision of such an envelope for the school building programme will enable my Department to provide greater clarity for all education partners concerning the progress of projects within the programme.The major investment of recent years in upgrading school accommodation has resulted in new and enhanced school accommodation throughout the country. In the five years up to and including 2002, a total of €1.248 billion has been spent by my Department on primary and post-primary school buildings. This is a very significant investment.The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidating the substantial progress that has already been made to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in the Agreed Programme for Government.My Department's commitment to supporting children with special educational needs within the primary school system is reflected in the significant growth in investment in special needs provision in recent years. This is illustrated by the following details. The number of learning support teachers in the primary school system has increased from 1,302 in 1998 to 1,531 at present. The annual salary cost of these teachers is approximately €54 million. The number of resource teachers has increased from 104 in 1998 to more than 2,300. The annual salary cost of these teachers is estimated at more than €70 million. The number of special needs assistants within the primary system has grown from 300 in 1998 to 4,239 full-time and a further 1,264 part-time posts. The annual salary cost of this service is estimated at €100 million for 2003.

The Government's decision to establish NEPS included the specification that there would ultimately be 184 psychologists in NEPS in addition to approximately 16 psychologists employed elsewhere in the educational system. I intend to recruit additional psychologists to make up the shortfall, as resources permit, and bearing in mind the general staffing constraints that exist at present.

There are three such licences and no licence has been revoked. However, an application for a licence was refused on appeal by the aquaculture licences appeals board.The conditions attached to an aquaculture licence relating to salmon farming may include limits on the numbers of fish that may be farmed or produced. Any such limits are determined on a case by case basis having regard to factors such as the nature and location of the proposed operation.

The Government remains committed to the forestry planting and support schemes, including the native woodland scheme operated by my Department. Given the level of funding available in 2003 it was decided in consultation with the forest sector to focus funding primarily on delivery of a viable planting programme. This meant that the funding available for the other schemes, including the native woodland scheme, in 2003 was limited and allowed only for supporting the development of pilot projects under that scheme. With respect to 2004, the funding allocation for forestry in general and the native woodland scheme in particular will be determined by the Estimates process for that year.

This grant aid of €17,458.90 per quarter was paid to St. Anne's until the society closed in September 2003. These resources are now being used by the board to provide these services.St. Anne's also provided a tracing service for adult adopted people which was organised and funded within the society itself. When St. Anne's closed in September, there was a waiting time of approximately two years for this service and approximately 30 cases of adopted people wishing to trace natural relatives transferred to the board for a tracing service.A researcher previously employed by St. Anne's is now working with the board on a six month contract and, among other things, is evaluating the work involved in maintaining the level of service provided by St. Anne's. The tracing and reunion service is being funded from within existing health board resources.

This was a private meeting of the type held from time to time with health sector unions to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern. Among the issues discussed was the report of the task force on assaults on psychiatric nurses, and in particular the proposal that a scheme be established to compensate psychiatric nurses seriously injured as a result of assault by a patient.I informed the PNA that my officials were preparing a memorandum for Government on the recommendations contained in the report. This draft memorandum has recently been circulated to other Departments for their observations. I expect to receive comments from them in the next few weeks. Further consideration will then be given to progressing the recommendations contained in the report.While I have no responsibility in relation to public servants outside the health service, I understand that some groups of public servants such as customs officers, have powers to detain persons against their will. Other than gardaí and prison officers, I am not aware of any group of public servants with access to a compensation scheme.Within the mental health services, consultant psychiatrists, registered medical practitioners and registered nurses may detain persons suffering from mental disorders as provided for under the Mental Health Act 2001.There is no compensation scheme in place for psychiatric nurses or any other group of health service staff who are assaulted by patients in the course of their duty. However, there are a number of existing supports in place for psychiatric nurses who are assaulted by patients. The serious physical assault scheme provides for sick leave of six months on full pay. An extension of three months on full pay and a further extension of three months on basic pay may be granted. If the nurse is certified permanently incapacitated, he or she is paid five sixths of basic salary. Certain medical expenses are refunded to a nurse who has been assaulted, including expenditure in respect of treatment provided by the public health service, consultant/GP/casualty visits and prescription charges.

With regard to the samples reportedly sent to the State laboratory, the inquiry group established that the laboratory had no record of receiving such samples, that the MWHB had not been invoiced for any such work, and that there were no postal records in the hospital laboratory of any such samples having been sent. The report concluded that a combination of errors, both human and of the systems involved, had contributed to the problem. The report made a number of recommendations, including the need for improvements in the receipt, tracking, testing and storage of samples at the pathology laboratory in Limerick Regional Hospital. The MWHB has advised my Department that it is actively pursuing the implementation of all the recommendations contained in the report. Against this background I have no plans at present to initiate a public inquiry.Some untested samples from the family concerned remain in storage awaiting instructions from the family physician as to what testing is required. The MWHB have advised my Department that the family was recently contacted in an attempt to establish how they wish to proceed regarding the testing of these samples. The Deputy may wish to note that I have met the family concerned on a number of occasions. On the latter two occasions, in November 2001 and February 2003, I suggested that they should request their GP to organise an independent assessment of their current health status and that my Department would fund this assessment. The MWHB has indicated that it strongly advised the family concerned that they be referred to an expert in environmental medicine anywhere in the world, to be paid for by the board and that the family have not taken up this offer.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	771	The Deputy will be aware that a multi-agency investigation co-ordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was carried out into health problems at Askeaton at the request, in 1995, of the Minister of State at the then Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, DoAFRD. The investigation involved the veterinary laboratory services of the DoAFRD (animal health), Teagasc (soils, herbage and related aspects), the EPA (environmental quality aspects), and the Mid-Western Health Board (human health).An investigation of the aluminium and fluoride levels in milk was carried out under the environmental quality aspects. While my Department had no direct involvement in these aspects, the investigation concluded that all available data indicated that the levels of potential pollutants in the Askeaton area in the period of the investigation were below those likely to cause harm to the environment generally, to animals, or to humans.The human health studies carried out included a literature review of the effects of common atmospheric pollutants, births and congenital abnormalities, sex ratio, twin rates, survey of perceived health problems in general practitioner practices in the area, health status of persons, acute health effects (diary study), cancer incidence, mortality, adolescent health, child absenteeism, horticultural produce, abnormal prescribing patterns and the hospital in-patient inquiry scheme. The results of these studies did not support a link to any form of environmental pollution nor did they find a significant degree of excessive ill health in the Askeaton area.

At present the guidelines prescribe a maximum floor area of 6,000 square metres gross retail floor space for large scale single retail warehouse development. This cap is being reviewed, taking account of the need to ensure effective competition in this sector of retailing and ongoing developments in retail formats, while ensuring proper planning and sustainable development. Central to this review will be the potential impact of the national spatial strategy on the guidelines and the need to ensure that cities and towns have the range of retail facilities that supports their attractiveness and competitiveness for investment and population growth.To assist in carrying out the review, I invited interested parties to make submissions to my Department. The closing date for receipt of submissions was 3 October and my Department received 64 submissions. They are being assessed and will be taken into account in considering whether changes are needed in the guidelines. No decision has yet been made as to whether the floor space cap on retail warehouses will be retained. The review process will be concluded in the coming months.

The general issue of gazumping was examined by the Law Reform Commission in October 1999. Its report examined the practice of taking booking deposits on the sale of new residential properties. It found that gazumping occurred in only a handful of cases, less than 5% and almost always on the sale of new houses. The commission concluded that the current legal position, which does not confer any interest in property upon the payment of a booking deposit, generally benefits the purchaser more than the vendor. The purchaser is allowed the flexibility to conduct the necessary preliminary investigations before committing to an irrevocable agreement.

Responsibility for the regulation of industry within the framework of the legislation lies with the agency. The Minister is statutorily precluded from exercising any power or control on the performance, in particular circumstances, by the agency of a function assigned to it under the Act.Accordingly, it is a matter for the agency to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place for compliance monitoring in respect of relevant activities. Enforcement of licence conditions and the allocation of resources, including personnel, to the tasks arising is also a matter for the agency. The recent establishment of the Office of Environmental Enforcement as a distinct and dedicated unit of the agency will bring an enhanced focus to licence enforcement generally.
