          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_2">I gclár an Rialtais a foilsíodh bliain ó shin, thug an Rialtas gealltanais éagsúla agus ceann acu siúd ná go dtabharfadh sé tacaíocht láidir chun creidmheas a chur ar fáil do chomhlachtaí beaga agus meánmhéide.  Anois, bliain ina dhiaidh sin, is oth liom a rá go bhfuil an gealltanas áirithe seo briste ag an Rialtas.  Téann sin leis an liosta fada de ghealltanais eile atá briste ag an Rialtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">Tá Banc Ceannais na hEorpa tar éis níos mó na €1 trilliún a chur isteach i gcóras airgeadais an Aontais Eorpaigh.  Tá níos mó na 800 banc timpeall na hEorpa tar éis leas a bhaint as an scéim seo.  Faraor, go dtí seo, níl comhlachtaí anseo ag fáil leasa ón infheistíocht seo.  D'ardaigh mé seo leis an Tánaiste agus leis an Taoiseach an tseachtain seo caite agus is féidir a rá go bhfuil fíor-easpa práinne ag an Taoiseach agus ag an Rialtas faoin ábhar fíor-thábhachtach seo.  Tá sé ráite arís agus arís eile ag eagraíochtaí ar nós ISME agus an SFA nach bhfuil creidmheas cuí le fáil ó na bainc.  Toisc an easpa creidmheasa seo, tá comhlachtaí ag gearradh siar ar líon na ndaoine atá ag obair leo nó, i gcásanna áirithe, ag dúnadh síos go hiomlán.  Tá comhlachtaí beaga ag rá liom gach lá gurb é an easpa creidmheasa an dúshlán is mó atá acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">An dtuigeann an Taoiseach go bhfuil poist á gcailliúint mar gheall ar an easpa creidmheasa seo?  Tá sé riachtanach go ndéanfadh an Rialtas rud éigin chun an fhadhb seo a réiteach gan aon mhoill eile.  Le déanaí, dúirt Gobharnóir Bhanc Ceannais na hÉireann, Patrick Honohan, go bhfuil coinníollacha creidmheasa in Éirinn níos déine anois ná in aon áit eile sa eurozone ó thaobh costas agus fála de.  Fós, áfach, níl an Rialtas ag déanamh aon rud chun an fhadhb a réiteach.  Tá a fhios ag gach duine go bhfuair na bainc airgead ón Stát chun creidmheas a chur ar fáil ach níor tharla sin.  Nach bhfuil sé in am don Taoiseach agus don Rialtas ord a thabhairt do na bainc bheith níos solúbtha agus creidmheas a chur ar fáil chun comhlachtaí beaga ar fud na tíre a shábháil?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_5">Ní briste atá gealltanais i dtaobh na deacrachta seo.  Tá a fhios ag an Teachta go maith go bhfuil an tAire Post, Fiontar agus Nuálaíochta ag déileáil le Bille chun creidmheas a thabhairt do chomhlachtaí beaga, ní amháin ó thaobh gealltanas dlíthiúil páirteach a thabhairt dóibh ach go mbeadh mion-chomhlacht Stáit curtha ar bun sa dóigh is go mbeadh creidmheas ar fáil do chomhlachtaí an-bheaga atá ag tosú.  Tá a fhios ag an Teachta freisin go bhfuil coiste Rialtais bunaithe ar a dtugtar an EMC agus bhí na bainc istigh os comhair an choiste sin i rith na coicíse seo caite.  Tá sé leagtha síos ag an Rialtas go mbeidh €3.5 billiúin de chreidmheas nua curtha ar fáil do chomhlachtaí ó na bainc.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">Tá a fhios ag an Teachta, ní amháin ina dháilcheantar féin ach ar fud na tíre, go bhfuil brú ar chomhlachtaí beaga mar gheall ar an nós a bhí ag na bainc go mbeadh foirgneamh, talamh nó airgead eile mar collateral chun airgead a fháil sa chéad áit agus ní mar sin atá cúrsaí faoi láthair.  Tá a fhios ag an Teachta freisin go bhfuil oifig ann chun iniúchadh a dhéanamh ar na cinntí faoi chreidmheas agus i 50% de na cásanna a thugtar os comhair na hoifige sin, tá an cinneadh aisiompaithe agus tugtar ord an creidmheas a chur ar fáil.  Níl dóthain comhlachtaí ag dul isteach chuig an oifig sin agus deireann na bainc nach bhuil a dóthain iarratas ag teacht isteach ag lorg creidmheasa sa chéad áit.  Bhí mé féin ag caint le bainisteoir bainc an lá cheana a thug airgead sách mór do comhlacht beag.  Dúirt mé leis gur cóir go mbeadh na bainc ag caint ar na stáisiúin raidió áitiúla ag tabhairt eolais do comhlachtaí agus ag dul amach chucu ag rá leo go bhfuil airgead acu ón Rialtas agus gur cóir do na comhlachtaí déileáil leo de bharr sin.  Is fíor a rá áfach, go bhfuil cuid de na comhlachtaí nach bhfuil in ann leagaint amach céard go díreach atá i gceist acu maidir le plean caiteachais don am amach rompu.  I gcuid de na cásanna seo, bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá mbeadh plean soiléir agus dáiríre ag na comhlachtaí beaga sula dtéann siad isteach chuig na bainc ar dtús.  De réir an eolais atá againn ó na bainc, bíonnn suas le 60% de na comhlachtaí beaga a théann isteach ag iarraidh airgid agus creidmheasa gan plean caiteachais don todhchaí leagtha amach acu.  Níl an geallúint briste mar sin.  Mar a dúirt mé leis an Teachta Ó Máirtín, tabharfaidh an tAire, an Teachta Bruton, an Bille isteach taobh istigh de chúig nó sé seachtain.</p>

          <p eId="para_7">Tá an freagra a thug an Taoiseach inniu dochreidte.  Deireann sé nach bhfuil dóthain comhlachtaí ag dul chuig an CRO.  An fáth nach bhfuil siad ag dul chuig an CRO agus an fáth nach bhfuil siad ag gearáin leis na bainc ná go bhfuil eagla orthu.  Tá eagla orthu mar tá na bainc ag cur brú orthu.  Deireann na bainc leo gan dul go dtí Teachtaí Dála, gan dul go dtí an CRO agus gan gearán a dhéanamh, nó beidh toradh ar sin.  Sin atá ag tarlú.</p>

Sin a deireann sé.  Cuirim an cheist ar an Taoiseach arís.  Nach bhfuil sé in am anois reachtaíocht a thabhairt isteach agus ordú a thabhairt do na bainc a bheith níos solúbtha agus airgead a thabhairt do na comhlachtaí beaga agus meánmhéid ar fud na tíre?

          <p eId="para_24">Chuala mé daoine ag caint faoin droch tionchar atá ag polasaí an Rialtais ar a saolta.  Tá seirbhísí tábhachtacha á dtarraingt amach as na pobail tuaithe, ina measc scoileanna, seirbhísí sláinte, oifigí phoist agus stáisiúin Gardaí.  Tá táillí an Rialtais, táillí ar thithe, ardú ar an cháin bhreisluacha agus táillí ar dabhcha séarachais ag gortú mhuintir na tuaithe.  Tá gnóthaí dúchasacha, feirmeoirí beaga ina measc, ag dul amach as gnónna gan cuidiú ar bith ón Rialtas nó gan creidmheas ar bith ó na bainc.  Tá pobail iascaireachta scriosta.  Tá glúin iomlán de daoine óga na tír ag imeacht uainn.  Sin í an fhírinne.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Tá an ceart ag pobal na tuaithe saol tuaithe a bheith acu más sin is mian leo.  An aontaíonn an Taoiseach le sin?  Is rud maith í an éagsúlacht.  Tugann an saol tuaithe éagsúlacht do mhuintir na hÉireann.  Tá Sinn Féin ag déanamh a dhícheall seasamh leis na hiascairí, feirmeoirí agus daoine eile faoin dtuath mar tá a slite beatha scriosta ag an Rialtas seo agus ag ceannairí Fhianna Fáil a tháinig rompu.  Iarraim ar an Taoiseach treo eile a ghlacadh.  Má tá tuath na hÉireann le bheith beo agus má tá saol maith le bheith ag teallaigh faoin dtuath, caithfidh a Taoiseach an treo a athrú.</p>

          <p eId="para_76">Tá an port céanna á chanadh ag an Teachta Higgins, ach i dteanga eile ar maidin.  Níor shínigh mé an conradh seo "faoi cheilt" ar chor ar bith.  Tharla sé go han-phoiblí.  Is maith an rud é do mhuintir na hÉireann, dar dtír agus do mhuintir na hEorpa.  Is é atá i gceist sa chás seo ná má ghlacann tír leis an gconradh, caithfidh an tír sin coinneáil leis na gcoiníollacha a bhaineann leis.  Nuair a bheidh ár dtír imithe ón bplean agus ón gcóras ina bhfuilimid ag feidhmiú faoi láthair taobh istigh de dhá bhliain, beidh seasamh i bhfad níos láidre, agus níos dáiríre ó thaobh córas na hEorpa de, againn chun iad siúd a bheidh ag smaoineamh ar infheistíocht a dhéanamh inár dtír a mhealladh más rud é go bhfuil an conradh seo glactha againn.  Tá sé sin i gceist againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Is é a bhí i gceist ag an Rialtas i leith na díospóireachtaí a bhí ar siúl faoin ESM ná go dtabharfaí amach an tagairt don PSI ó na focail a bhí ag baint leis an ESM sa chonradh.  Tá sé sin i bhfad níos fearr dúinn.  Bheadh imní orthu siúd a bheadh ag iarraidh infheistíocht a dhéanamh anseo dá mbeadh an tagairt sin fágtha sa chonradh.  Bhí sé an-soiléir sa díospóireacht phoiblí ag éirí as an ESM má ghlacann tír leis an gconradh, beidh sé in ann airgead a fháil ón ESM más gá leis.  Ní dóigh linn go mbeidh sé sin á thabhairt i gcrích againn.  Ag an am gcéanna, bheadh seasamh i bhfad níos láidre againn dá mbeadh an conradh glactha ag muintir na hÉireann.  Níl bata os cionn éinne.  Nílimid ag cur scanradh ar duine ar bith.  Ba cheart go mbeadh díospóireacht an-soiléir agus iomlán againn faoin gconradh seo.  Ba mhaith an rud é go mbeadh eolas ag gach éinne sa tír seo céard go díreach atá i gceist.  Beidh traein na hEorpa ag fágáil an stáisiún ar 1 Eanáir 2013.</p>

Nuair a bheidh plean an Rialtais curtha i gcrích ag an Rialtas, beidh cúrsaí eacnamaíochta i bhfad níos láidre ag teacht chugainn.  Is é atá i gceist againn ná an líne infheistíochta isteach go dtí an tír seo a choimeád an-láidir, ar mhaithe le jabanna, comhlachtaí agus cúrsaí easpórtála.  Dúirt an Teachta Higgins go bhfuil bata mór á húsáid ag an Rialtas chun muintir na hÉireann a bhagairt, ach níl sé sin i gceist.  Tá súil agam go labhróidh sé leo siúd ina dáilcheantar atá ag obair agus ag iarraidh cúrsaí easpórtála a láidriú.  Ba chóir dóibh siúd agus gach éinne eile vótáil i bhfábhar an reafrainn nuair a tharlóidh sé.</p>

Dá mba rud é go raibh an chomhshocrú fioscach seo i bhfeidhm trí, ceithre nó cúig bliana roimhe seo, bheadh an praiseach eacnamaíochta céanna againn i láthair na huaire.  Is í sin an fhírinne.  Tá an Rialtas ag iarraidh an fhírinne a chlúdach suas.  Tá sé ina phraiseach in an-chuid slite.  Níl a fhios ag éinne cad atá i gceist le 0.5% d'easnamh struchtúrach, nó structural deficit.  Deireann an ciste domhanda, an IMF, rud amháin agus deireann Coimisiún na hEorpa rud eile.  Cad ar a bhfuil an Rialtas ag iarraidh ar mhuintir na tíre votáil ar a shon?  Tá mé ag iarraidh freagra cruinn ón Taoiseach.  Nach bhfuil sé fíor go gcaithfidh Dáil Éireann glacadh leis an alt seo a chuireann leasú isteach i gconradh an ESM?  Caithfidh Dáil Éireann glacadh leis go mbeidh an alt seo istigh agus nach féidir airgead a tharraingt ón gciste gan glacadh leis an gcomhshocrú fioscach.  Nach gciallaíonn sé sin go gcaithfidh cúlbhinseoirí de chuid Fine Gael agus Páirtí an Lucht Oibre teacht isteach anseo agus vótáil chun an dúmháil, an blackmail, agus an bata mór seo a chur i lámha an Choimisiúin Eorpaigh?</p>

Má leanann an rud ar aghaidh ar feadh dhá bhliain ina dhiadh sin, tá sé i gceist go dtiocfaidh an structural deficit isteach mar a luaigh an Teachta.  Tá sé i gceist ag an Rialtas go mbeidh cúrsaí eacnamaíochta i bhfad níos láidre ó thaobh ár gcomhlachtaí agus cúrsaí easpórtála faoin am sin, mar a tharla sna 1990í.  In ainneoin an méid a dúirt an Teachta, ní clár austerity atá i gceist anseo ach clár i bhfad níos láidre eacnamaíochta a chur ar bun.  Tá sé i gceist againn go mbeidh an t-eolas ar fad faoi céard atá i gceist anseo ní hamháin ag na Teachtaí anseo ó chuile pháirtí agus na Teachtaí Neamhspleácha, ach freisin ag gach duine sa tír.  Ní chonradh Eorpach atá i gceist anseo, ach conradh idir na tíortha.  Ní féidir linn cosc nó deireadh a chur leis.  An cheist a bheidh an Rialtas á cur ná an gceadaíonn muintir na hÉireann dúinn an conradh seo a chur i gcrích.  Tá sé sínithe agam ach ní leor sin ach go mbeidh an cheist freagartha ag muintir na hÉireann a rá linn go bhfuil siad sásta glacadh leis an chonradh go bunreachtúil.</p>

Táim i gcoinne an mholta atá i Riar na hOibre mar tá guillotine i bhfeidhm.  Níor chóir go mbeadh a leithéid i bhfeidhm agus ba cheart go dtabharfaí níos mó ama go ndéanfaimis cinnte de.

Gheall an Taoiseach ar "The Late Late Show" le Ryan Tubridy go raibh an Taoiseach i ndáiríre go n-éiseofar cárta tuairisce do gach Aire.  Ca bhfuil na cártaí tuairisce?  Beidh na hAirí ag dul thart ar an domhan anois agus bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá mbeadh na cártaí ag na hAirí roimh dul thar lear.

Beidh sé foilsithe nuair a bheidh sé réidh.  Tá an t-Aire ag déanamh an obair air faoi láthair.  Maidir le hinfheistíocht, tá níos mó airgid i Vóta an Aire Post, Fiontar agus Nuálaíochta ná mar a bhí ariamh cheana.  Mar a dúirt mé leis an Teachta Ó Máirtín, tabharfar an Bille isteach anseo taobh istigh de chúig nó sé seachtain.  Baineann an Bille le creidmheas agus solúbthacht do comhlachtaí beaga maidir le airgead agus creidmheas a fháil le haghaidh infheistíochta agus postanna a chur ar fáil.  Beidh seans ag an Teachta labhairt ansin.</p>

B'shin an cheist faoi athbhreithnithe ardaitheacha amháin ar chíosanna, upward only rent reviews.  In ainneoin go ndúirt an tArd-Aighne nach raibh reachtaíocht cuí sa chás seo, toisc go mbeadh sí ag teacht salach ar an mBunreacht, an bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Rialtas athrú bunreachtúil a dhéanamh i bhfoirm reifrinn.  Os rud é go mbeidh pobal na tíre ag vótáil i reifreann eile, an féidir leis an Rialtas an deis sin a thapú chun a dhéanamh cinnte de go dtiocfaidh athrú ar seo ionas nach mbeidh aon reachtaíocht ag teacht salach ar an mBunreacht, go háirithe mar tá a lán siopaí agus lucht gnó i gcruachás faoi láthair.</p>

The publication has caused great concern among the people who work in the various airports, as well as the business and tourism industries surrounding those facilities.  There has been nothing further from the Minister on how quickly he intends to proceed with the options outlined in the legislation.

          <p eId="para_238">Tá an-áthas orm an deis seo a bheith agam ráiteas a dhéanamh maidir le Seachtain na Gaeilge.  Tá Seachtain na Gaeilge ar bun le 110 bliain, agus tá sí ag dul i méid agus i neart i gcónaí.  Is í an fhéile idirnáisiúnta Ghaeilge is mó ar domhan, agus tá na céadta imeachtaí á reáchtáil ar fud an domhain chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn i measc Éireannaigh agus i measc na mílte daoine as tíortha eile a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Tugann an fhéile seo deis go gach uile dhuine spraoi a bheith acu leis an nGaeilge, idir chainteoirí dúchasacha agus iad siúd atá ag fáil a gcéad bhlaiseadh den teanga.  Molaim go hard na heagraíochtaí éagsúla, idir comhairlí áitiúla, scoileanna, leabharlanna, agus eagrais cheoil, spóirt agus chultúrtha, as an bpáirt atá á glacadh acu in imeachtaí na seachtaine.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I gclár an Rialtais leagtar amach spriocanna éagsúla chun stádas agus úsáid na Gaeilge a fheabhsú.  Tacóimid le straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge agus déanfaimid na haidhmeanna agus na spriocanna insroichte atá molta a bhaint amach.  Déanfaimid athchóiriú iomlán ar an gcuraclam Gaeilge agus ar an tslí a mhúintear an Ghaeilge i scoileanna ionas go leagfar níos mó béime ar scileanna cainte agus éisteachta.  Déanfaimid 50% de na marcanna a thabhairt don scrúdú béil sa Ghaeilge ag leibhéal na hardteistiméireachta agus beidh sé mar aidhm againn líon na macléinn a dhéanann an scrúdú ardleibhéil san ardteistiméireacht a dhúbailt faoin mbliain 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Gheobhaidh limistéir Ghaeltachta tairbhe ónár bplean gníomhaíochta fostaíochta.  Faoi na moltaí atá againne, déanfaimid ionchais nua maidir le cruthú fostaíochta a sholáthar do réigiúin Ghaeltachta.  Déanfaimid infheistíocht i mbonneagar fuinnimh, leathanbhanda agus uisce, agus cruthófar an bonneagar nua-aimseartha is gá chun gnóthaí nua agus fostaíocht a tharraingt agus chun tacú leis sin.  Tacóimid go mór leis na hionchais maidir le fostaíocht i ngníomhaíochtaí turasóireachta agus muirí.  Leanfaimid de thacú le craolachán Gaeilge agus le hearnáil ealaíon na Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">De bhreis air sin, cuirfidh an Bille Gaeltachta atá idir lámha againn faoi láthair ar ár gcumas na céimeanna cuí a thógáil chun tús a chur leis an bpróiseas pleanála teanga sa Ghaeltacht, agus tabharfaidh sé feidhm reachtúil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta maidir le forfheidhmiú na straitéise 20 bliain don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Cé gur aidhmeanna tábhachtacha iad seo, ní leor iad gan an díograis agus an grá don teanga atá á léiriú ag gach duine a bheidh ag glacadh páirte i Seachtain na Gaeilge.  Spreagann said dóchas ionainn maidir le todhchaí na Gaeilge, agus guím gach rath orthu.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
          <p eId="para_244">Is cúis ar leith áthais dom an seans seo a bheith agam mo thacaíocht do Sheachtain na Gaeilge a chur in iúl don Teach agus don phobal atá ag éisteacht linn.  Is deas agus is cuí tréimhse ar leith a chur ar leataobh le ceiliúradh a dhéanamh ar an gné is suntasaí agus is ársa do chultúr na tíre seo: an Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Tacaím go hiomlán lena bhfuil ráite ag an Taoiseach maidir le tiomantas an Rialtais seo do chur chun cinn agus caomhnú na Gaeilge tríd an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.  Aithníonn an straitéis go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith leis an teanga labhartha agus leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta mar bhun-tobar na teanga.  Faoin straitéis, tá fúinn an teanga a chur á labhairt ar fud na tíre agus deis a thabhairt do gach saoránach an teanga a shealbhú agus a labhairt ó lá go lá.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Tá go leor tuartha dóchais ann maidir leis an nGaeilge san 21ú aois.  Tá muinín agus beocht nua faoin teanga sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, a bhuíochas sin d'obair na gcoistí pobail, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Raidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4.  Tá borradh faoin teanga ar fud na tíre mar gheall ar an obair éachtach atá ar siúl ag daltaí, tuismitheoirí agus foirne na ngaelscoileanna, ag na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge is na meáin Ghaeilge ar fud an oileáin.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Ar ndóigh, ní leor dea-thoil leis an nGaeilge a thabhairt agus a choinneáil slán.  Tá dúshlán mór romhainn mar phobal sna blianta beaga amach romhainn.  Má táimid i ndáiríre faoin teanga, caithfimid níos mó ná dea-fhocail a rá mar gheall uirthi ó am go chéile.  Caithfimid a chinntiú go bhfuil deis cheart ag saoránach plé leis an Stát trí Ghaeilge mar a leagtar amach in Acht na Teangacha Oifigiúla.  Caithfimid beatha na teanga sna ceantair Ghaeltachta a chinntiú trí fhostaíocht a chur fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta, óige na Gaeltachta ach go háirithe.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Mar Thánaiste agus Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Trádála, ba mhaith liom aitheantas ar leith a thabhairt don ról gur féidir a bheith ag an nGaeilge chun íomhá idirnáisiúnta an Stáit a fheabhsú chomh maith.  Is ábhar ceiliúrtha dúinn go bhfuil staidéar á dhéanamh ar an nGaeilge in ollscoileanna agus in institiúidí léinn ar fud na cruinne, go háirithe ar mhór-roinn na hEorpa, sna Stáit Aontaithe agus i gCeanada.  Is cúis áthais dom go dtugann mo Roinn tacaíocht ar leith don obair seo tríd scoláireachtaí Fulbright sna Stáit Aontaithe agus Fondúireacht Cheanada.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Le linn Sheachtain na Gaeilge, is cúis bhróid dom an tacaíocht a thugann mo Roinn do Ghlór na Gael, don chomórtas Global Gaeilge, a chuireann an Ghaeilge chun cinn ar fud na cruinne i measc an phobail Éireannaigh.  Le dhá bhliain anuas, bhuaigh grúpaí as an Astráil, as an Bhreatain, as na Stáit Aontaithe Meiriceá agus as Ceanada, i measc tíortha eile, duaiseanna san comórtas seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Tá an Ghaeilge aitheanta mar theanga oifigiúil is oibre san Aontas Eorpach.  Cuireann an t-aitheantas seo le tuiscint agus meas ballstáit eile an Aontais Eorpaigh ar ár bhféiniúlacht mar Éireannaigh is Eorpaigh.  Ar ndóigh, cuireann an t-aitheantas seo deiseanna fostaíochta ar fáil do dhaoine óga le Gaeilge chomh maith.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Is ceart a chuimhneamh ar an ról a bhí ag an nGaeilge le linn na cuairteanna ag an Banríon Eilís II agus an tUachtarán Obama an bhliain seo chaite, agus an méid a dúirt an tUachtarán Obama agus é ar Fhaiche an Choláiste.  Sin an dearcadh is ceart dúinn a ghlacadh maidir leis an nGaeilge, gur féidir linn í a thabhairt ar aghaidh slán don chéad ghlúin eile agus gur féidir linn taispeáint don domhan ar fad go bhfuil meas againn ar an ngné seo dár gcultúr agus go gcreidimid go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar sheod luachmhar de chuid an chultúir dhomhanda.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_252">Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le gach duine a d'eagraigh go mbeadh béim áirithe ar an nGaeilge inniu sa Dáil.  Is féidir a rá gan dabht go bhfuil sé tábhachtach dúinn mar Pharlaimint agus mar thír go mbainfimis úsáid as an nGaeilge chomh minic agus is féidir.  Fáiltím mar sin an seans labhairt san am atá tugtha inniu sa Dáil.  Ba mhaith liom freisin a rá ag an tús go bhfuilim bródúil as an méid a bhain Fianna Fáil amach i Rialtas ó thaobh fhás úsáid na Gaeilge.  Táim ag smaoineamh go háirithe ar an mborradh sa ghaelscolaíocht atá anois ar fáil ar fud na tíre.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Agus Fianna Fáil i Rialtas, chuireamar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla in áit, bhunaíomar Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga, bhunaíomar Foras na Gaeilge agus leathnaíomar soláthar oideachas trí Ghaeilge, go háirithe sna gaelscoileanna agus ag an tríú leibhéal.  Chomh maith leis sin, bhaineamar amach stádas don Ghaeilge san Aontas Eorpach.  Caithfimid aitheantas áirithe a thabhairt don Teachta Éamon Ó Cuiv agus an iar-Theachta Pat Carey don obair seo.  Gan iad, táim den tuairim nach mbeadh an Ghaeilge chomh láidir inniu agus atá sí.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Caithfimid aitheantas a thabairt freisin don dea-obair atá ar siúl go laethúil ag TG4 agus ag Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Cuireann siad seirbhís ar fheabhas ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta le cláir de hard-chaighdeán Gaeilge.  Arís, tugaim aitheantas agus moladh do leithéidí Máire Geoghegan-Quinn agus don Uachtarán Michael D. Higgins don méid a bhaineadar amach.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Chomh maith leis an méid a bainte amach le blianta beaga anuas, chuir an Rialtas deireanach plean réalaíoch in áit chun úsáid na Gaeilge a fhás - an straitéis 20 bliain.  I Rialtas, d'fhoilsíomar straitéis don Ghaeilge a thugann treoir-phlean chun caomhnú agus athbheochan na Gaeilge i dtréimhse 20 bliain.  Is cuspóir lárnach sa straitéis é líon na ndaoine atá ag labhairt na teanga go laethúil a mhéadú ó 83,000 go 250,000.  Fáiltím roimh iarrachtaí leithéidí Bernard Dunne, atá ag tabhairt ceannasaíocht maidir le cuspóir na straitéise a bhaint amach.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Ba mhaith liom díriú ar cúpla ábhar imní atá agam maidir le polasaithe an Rialtais ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Mar thoradh ar an dul chun cinn atá bainte amach, tá an Gaeilge á labhairt in áiteanna áirithe don chéad uair ó aimsir an Ghorta.  Is féidir paistí a chloisint ag labhairt Gaeilge i mbailte agus i gcathracha ar fud na tíre.  Cé go bhfuil dul chun cinn suntasach déanta lasmuigh don Ghaeltacht, tá an Rialtas ar tí cinneadh tubaisteach a dhéanamh maidir le scoileanna tuaithe, go háirithe na scoileanna Ghaeltachta.  Ba mhaith liom glaoch ar an Taoiseach athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an gcinneadh tubaisteach seo.  Ní hamháin go gcuirfidh sé saol na tuaithe i mbaol, ach i gceantair Ghaeltachta cuirfidh sé an Ghaeilge mar theanga beo laethúil an phobail i mbaol.  Ní cheart é seo a dhéanamh.  Impím ar an Taoiseach athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar seo gan mhoill.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Tá an cinneadh atá togtha ag an Rialtas chun nasc daonlathach a bhriseadh maidir le Údarás na Gaeltachta ag cur imní ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta freisin.  Ar feadh na blianta, bhí nasc réalaíoch idir na ceantair Gaeltachta eagsúla agus an t-údaras tríd na toghcháin.  Ar chúis nach dtuigeann éinne sa Ghaeltacht, tá an Taoiseach ag cur deireadh leis na toghcháin seo.  Is cinneadh frith-dhaonlathach é deireadh a chur le toghcháin an údarais.  Ba cheart don Taoiseach stop a chur leis an bpolasaí seo.  Tá a fhios ag gach éinne go mbeidh an córas nua oscailte do go leor "cronyism" as seo amach má leantar ar aghaidh leis an bplean faoi mar atá sé faoi láthair.  Impím ar an Taoiseach athbhreithniú a dhéanamh freisin ar an ábhar seo gan mhoill.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Ó mo chuid ama mar Aire Oideachas agus Eolaíochta, tá suim agam i mbunú ionad oiliúna chun teagasc na Gaeilge a fheabhsú agus áiseanna Gaeilge a chur ar fáil do dhaoine a mhúineann an teanga sna gaelscoileanna agus na gnáthscoileanna.  Ta géarghá ann ionad den tsórt sin a bhunú.  Tuigim go raibh deacrachtaí i rith na blianta</p>

          <p eId="para_266">Gan amhras.  larraim ar an Taoiseach agus na hAirí eagsúla iarracht nua a dhéanamh dul chun cinn a dhéanamh maidir leis an tionscadal seo.  Mar is eol dúinn, bhí plean ann ionad a bhunú i mBaile Bhúirne i nGaeltacht Mhúscraí agus is fíú féachaint ar seo athuair.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Tá go leor dul chun cinn déanta maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge le blianta beaga anuas.  Ní hé seo an t-am stad a chur leis an dul chun cinn sin.  Faraoir, tá roinnt cinntí atá á dhéanamh ag Rialtas Fhine Ghael agus an Lucht Oibre ag cur todhchaí na Gaeilge i mbaol.  Impím ar an Taoiseach greim pearsanta a thógaint ar an ábhar seo.  Tabharfaidh Fianna Fáil gach tacaíocht don Taoiseach an Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Ní doigh linn go bhfuil sé maith a dhóthain nár bhuail an coiste comhaireachta na Gaeilge ó mí Bhealtaine seo caite, mar a d'admhaigh an tAire Stáit, an Teachta McGinley, inné.  Is léir ón fhíric amháin seo go bhfuil easpa tiomantas ag an Rialtas i leith na Gaeilge.  Iarraim inniu ar an Taoiseach níos mó béime a chur ar an nGaeilge.</p>

          <p eId="para_270">Gabhaim buíochas leo siúd ar fad a d'oibrigh ar son na Gaeilge thar na blianta - in amanna deacra agus in amanna níos éasca.  Tá mé ag smaoineamh go háirithe ar teaghlaigh Gaeilge.  Gabhaim buíochas speisialta le TG4, Raidió na Gaeltachta, Raidió Fáilte agus na meáin cumarsáide Gaeilge eile.  Beatha teanga í a labhairt.  Cuireann sé an-shásamh orm go bhfuil borradh tagtha ar líon na nGaeilgeoirí sa tír.  Is féidir cuid mhaith don fhás sin a cheangailt le gluaiseacht na gaelscoileanna, na naíonraí agus tuismitheoirí dílse.  Cuireann sé gliondar croí orm go bhfuil an oiread sin daoine óga ach go háirithe ag taispeáint suim sa Ghaeilge agus ag glacadh páirt i n-eagraíochtaí ar nós Conradh na Gaeilge agus Glór na nGael.  Ní mór dúinn bheith airdeallach nach dtiocfaidh meath ar fás an teanga, go háirithe leis an méid daoine ar deoraíocht thar sáile.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Beidh impleachtaí ollmhóra ag na ciorruithe oideachais a leagadh amach sa bhuiséad ar ghlúinte de pháistí Gaeltachta agus ar todhchaí an teanga má chailltear múinteoirí os na scoileanna Gaeltachta.  Tá ról tabhachtach ó thaobh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge de, agus ó thaobh maoirseacht Acht na dTeangacha Oifigúla 2003 de, ag an gCoimisinéir Teanga.  Níl aon fianaise go dtiocfaidh aon sábhail airgead as an gcónascadh le hOifig an Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Tá tábhacht faoi leith ag na Gaeltachtaí ó thaobh blas na teanga.  Sa chomhthéacs sin, chualamar níos luaithe go bhfuil cinn Bhille na Gaeltachta aontaithe.  Cathain a fhoilsíodh an reachtaíocht sin?  Tuigim go bhfuil post príomhfheidhmeannach an údaráis fógraithe faoi dheireadh.  Tá go leor imní ar phobal na Gaeltachta.  Chuala mé an Tánaiste á rá go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta an-shásta, ach níl sé sin fíor.  Bím i dTír Chonaill measartha minic, agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill faoi bhrú.  Tá imní orthu nach mbeidh seans acu bord an údaráis a thoghadh go daonlathach mar ba chóir go mbeadh.  An bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta ráiteas a dheánamh ar conas a roghnófar an bord as seo amach?  Is ábhar imní é go bhfuil go leor ciorraithe á dhéanamh ar bhuiseád caipitil an údaráis.  Tá gá le postanna nua a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Ar ábhar an tsamhail nua mhaoinithe do na heagraíochtaí bunmhaoinithe Gaeilge, is léir gur gá don Aire Stáit oibriú i gcomhpháirtíocht leis an Aire chultúr sa Tionól, Carál Ní Chuilín, chun an imní atá orthu siúd in earnáil phobail na Gaeilge agus an taithí atá ag cuid mhaith acu a thogáil ar bord.  Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit tacaíocht a thabhairt don obair atá á dheánamh sa Tionól chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Fógraíodh feachtas líofa le tamall anuas.  Molaim an chlár líofa a scaipeadh trasna an Stát agus an oileán seo fosta.  Nuair a bhuaileamar leis an Aire Stáit cúpla seachtain ó shin, chuireamar an rún sin chuige.  Is cúis áthais é dom - sílim go bhfuil an Taoiseach agus an Tánaiste sásta freisin - go bhfuil daoine ón dá thraidisiún tar éis síniú suas don feachtas líofa.  Iarraim ar an Rialtas a fhógru go seasóidh sé le geallúint Rialtais na Breataine Acht teanga iomlánmhaoinithe agus ceartbhunaithe a thabhairt isteach.  Briseadh an geallúint sin, áfach.  Ba cheart don Rialtas freisin tacaíocht substantiúil a thabhairt i dtreo aitheantas oifigiúil agus stádas a thabhairt don Ghaeilge i gcúirteanna na Sé Contae.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Tá sé "illegal" an Ghaeilge a úsáid i gcúirteanna sna Sé Contae fós.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Glacaim an seans seo le <i>bród.ie</i>  a moladh.  Seo suíomh ina bhfuil Bernard Dunne agus daoine ón earnáil phoiblí ag tabhairt sár shampla dúinn uilig.  Tá straitéis 20 bliain ag Sinn Féin don Ghaeilge agus déanfaidh muid iarracht chun í a chur i bhfeidhm sna réímsí cultúr, spórt, pobal, oideachas agus Gaeltachta.  Tacaíonn Sinn Féin le cultúrlann mar tá hubanna Gaelacha ar fáil anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath, ach níl aon cultúrlann sa chathair.  Is éagóir é sin.  Tá cultúrlann i mBéal Feirste agus i nDoire agus, b’fhéidir, in áiteanna eile.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh ionad lárnach le himeachtaí sóisialta ar fáil in achan baile mór ar fud na tíre.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_276">Molaim an Príomh Aoire, an Teachta Paul Kehoe, as glacadh leis an moladh a dhein mé thar na blianta maidir le lá na Gaeilge agus molaim na príomh aoirí a bhí ann roimhe seo.  Tá súil go dtiocfaidh fás as an sórt ruda seo agus nach mbeidh na díospóireachtaí dírithe ar ráitis amháin mar atá inniu.  Tá sé léirithe againn ar maidin gur féidir linn ár gnó, nó an chuid is mó de, a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.  Molaim gach duine a ghlac páirt inniu.  Is comhartha an-dearfach maidir leis an Ghaeilge é dóibh siúd atá ag foghlaim agus dóibh siúd atá ar an ngannchuid maidir leis an Ghaeilge, gur féidir cur chuige agus gur féidir linne ár gnó a dhéanamh.  Más féidir linne é a dhéanamh, is féidir le gach réimse eile sa tír é a dhéanamh chomh maith.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Molaim chomh maith iad siúd atá gafa le Seachtain na Gaeilge, cé gur beagnach coicís na Gaeilge atá ann anois.  Tá gach sórt imeachta eagraithe acu thar timpeall na tíre, Rith 2012 ina measc.  Caithfidh muid díriú isteach ar na ceisteanna móra maidir leis an Ghaeilge, ceisteanna faoi na Gaeltachtaí, scoileanna Gaeilge agus faoi conas is féidir an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa Státcóras ina iomlán.  Ceist a d'ardaigh mise thar na blianta ná ceist faoin comhlachtaí nua.  Thug an Rialtas "quangos" orthu nuair a bhí siad ar an taobh seo den Teach, ach anois tá comhlachtaí nua Stáit le cur ar bun.  Tá súil againn go dtabharfaidh an Rialtas tús áite don Ghaeilge nuair a bheidh sé ag ainmniú na n-eagras sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Má tá seoid ag duine, déanann sé iarracht í a chur chun cinn.  Caitheann an duine an seoid ionas go bhfeicfidh daoine í.  Faoi láthair, ní aithnítear an Ghaeilge mar seoid den sórt sin.  Tá an Ghaeilge níos cosúla le seoid i músaem ar a mbíonn daoine ag féachaint.  Caithfidh muidne na cinntí a ghlacadh anois chun a dhéanamh cinnte de gur seoid cheart, chultúrtha í an Ghaeilge agus go gcuirtear chun cinn í.  Ba mhaith liom deis a thabhairt don Teachta Pearse Doherty cúpla focal a rá.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá.  Labhair na Teachtaí a chuaigh romham fa dtaobh den dul chun cinn mór atá déanta ag pobal na Gaeltachta, pobal na Gaeilge agus, go háirithe, na meáin cumarsáide agus daoine aonair fosta.  Feiceann muid an dornálaí Bernard Dunne ag iarraidh daoine a mhealladh leis an Ghaeilge a úsáid agus chonaic muid Des Bishop roimhe sin ag déanamh sin.  Cuirim fáilte roimh daoine cosúil leo siúd a úsáideann an stádas mór le rá atá acu le cuidiú leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Ba mhaith liom díriú ar chúpla pointe.  Labhair mé ar seo níos luaithe ar Riar na hOibre.  Tá muid uilig ar aon taobh sa Teach seo ó thaobh dul chun cinn na Gaeilge agus an tábhacht atá leis an Ghaeilge agus leis an Ghaeltacht mar tobar na Gaeilge.  Ceann de na rudaí a chuireann isteach orm ná nuair a chloisim ón Taoiseach nár bhuail an coiste aireachta ó thaobh an Ghaeilge agus na Gaeltachtaí le chéile.  Ní le rud amháin atá an coiste ag déileáil, ní le Bille Údarás na Gaeltachta amháin atá an coiste ag déileáil.  Tá sé ag déileáil leis an straitéis 20 bliain.  Níor bhuail an coiste le chéile ó 19 Meitheamh 2011 agus sílim go bhfuil rud neamh contráilte faoi sin.  Má amharcann muid, ó tháinig an Rialtas seo i bhfeidhm, níor bhuail an coiste le chéile ach dhá uair - taobh istigh de cheithre seachtain - uair amháin in Aibreán agus uair eile i Meitheamh, ach ansin le 10 mí anuas níor chas siad le chéile.  Tá sin contráilte.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Tá rud eile a chuireann isteach go mór orm.  Rinne an Rialtas deireannach staidéar cuimsitheach ar an Ghaeltacht agus ar Údarás na Gaeilge.  Dúradh ansan go soiléir nach mbeidh an Ghaeltacht is láidre beo taobh istigh de 15 bliain muna dtugann muid aird ar an fhadhb sin.  Ní fheicim go bhfuil an Rialtas ag tabhairt aird ar an fhadhb sin.  D'fhéadfainn caint ar feadh an lae agus is mór an trua é nach bhfuil go leor ama againn leis na ceisteanna tábhachtacha seo a phlé.  Le cuidiú Dé, beidh seans againn sa todhchaí.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_282">Tá áthas orm go bhfuil Seachtain na Gaeilge againn agus go bhfuil cuid de gnó na Dála ag leanúint ar aghaidh as Gaeilge.  I slí eile, tá díomá orm toisc nach bhfuil ach seachtain amháin againn sa bhliain nuair a dhéanann muid iarracht leanúint ar aghaidh as Gaeilge.  B'fhéidir go mba ceart dúinn níos mó iarrachta a dhéanamh sa Dáil agus lá nó maidin gach seachtain, nó ar a laghad gach mhí, a thabhairt le gnó na Dála a phlé trí Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Tá Gaeilge agam, ach b'fhearr liom dá mbeadh sí i bhfad níos fearr.  An fáth go bhfuil sí agam ná go raibh an suim ag mo mháthair i gcúrsaí Gaeilge.  Bhí an t-ádh orm chomh maith nuair a bhí mé ag freastal ar an mheánscoil - Cnoc Carmel, Sráid Óstaí an Rí, Baile Átha Cliath - toisc go raibh beirt múinteoir Gaeilge agam a bhí ar fheabhas.  Ba as Ciarraí an bheirt bhan agus ba chainteoirí ó dhúchas iad.  Spreag siad grá don teanga ionam agus i mo chairde.  Bhí a fhios againn gur rud bheo í an Ghaeilge agus gur teanga í le labhairt in ionad í a fhágaint sna leabhair.  Sin an tslí le dul ar aghaidh leis an Ghaeilge.  Caithfidh mé a admháil gur bhain mé lán taitneamh as <i>Peig</i>, <i>Fiche Bliain ag Fás</i> agus <i>An t-Oileánach</i> nuair a bhí mé ag staidéar don ardteist.  Thaitin siad liom.  Tá litríocht agus filíocht an-saibhir againn as Gaeilge.  Nuair a bhí an toghchán ar siúl an bhliain seo caite, is dócha gur cheap a lán daoine gurb í an díospóireacht as Gaeilge idir na ceannairí an díospóireacht is fearr.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Má tá muid i ndáiríre maidir leis an Ghaeilge, ba cheart go mbeadh gach bunscoil mar Gaelscoil.  Téann leanaí ar Gaelscoil ag ceithre nó cúig bliain d'aois agus bíonn Gaeilge ag cuid acu, ach ní bhíonn Gaeilge ag cuid mhór dóibh, ach bíonn fonn ar a dtuismitheoirí go mbeidh Gaeilge acu.  Tar éis bliana nó dhá bhliain bíonn siad ar fad ag labhairt Gaeilge.  Tá páistí cosúil le spúinsí ag an aois sin agus is féidir leo teanga eile a labhairt chomh maith lena gnáth teanga.  Tá an obair á dhéanamh ag na Gaelscoileanna, bunscoileanna agus meánscoileanna agus ba cheart go dtabharfadh an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna tacaíocht dóibh leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair.  Nuair atá fonn ar tuismitheoirí Gaelscoil a bhunú, ba cheart don Roinn tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Ba cheart go mbeadh seans níos mó ag daoine labhairt as Gaeilge agus muinín a bheith acu é sin a dhéanamh.  Labhair daoine faoi TG4 agus raidió trí Ghaeilge.  Caithfidh mé comhghairdeas a ghabháil le Raidió na Life.  Tá an jab á dhéanamh ag an fhoireann ansin agus anois tá a fhios againn gur féidir caint as Gaeilge le blas duine ó Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Ceapaim gur féidir linn a bheith cosúil le tír mar Ceanada, An Bhreatain Bheag agus an Bheilg, tíortha atá dhátheangach.</p>

Tá brón orm gur bhris an Rialtas a gheallúintí faoi na scoileanna beaga ar fud na tíre, idir Gaelscoileanna agus scoileanna beaga i ngach áit.  Anois, i scoileanna ina bhfuil duine, beirt nó triúr múinteoir tá na múinteoirí ag troid agus ag déanamh a dhícheall chun páistí a choimeád sa pharóiste.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, Glór na nGael, Conradh na Gaeilge, Cumann Lúthchleas Gael agus go leor eile as an sár obair a dhéanann siad chun an Ghaeilge agus an cultúr a chur chun cinn.  Tá mé ag smaoineamh ar rudai mar Scór na n-Óg, Scór na bPáistí agus Scór Sinsear.  Cuirim fáilte mhór roimh na páistí agus na mic léinn ollscoile atá sa Ghailearaí ar maidin.  Ba mhaith liom go mbéadh lá in aghaidh na míosa, ar a laghad, nuair a úsáidfeadh Teachtaí cupla focal Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Tá Gaeilge bhriste agamsa ach ní raibh aon Bhéarla ag mo sheanmháthair.  Tá cónaí orm in aice le Caisleán Nua na Súire, áit a bhí ina bhreac Gaeltacht go dtí 1977.  Táimid ag déanamh a lán oibre ansin.  Tá naíonra nua againn atá ag dul ar aghaidh go han-mhaith ar fad agus bíonn Coláiste Cois Súire againn gach samhradh.  Tagann daltaí ó gach áit i dTiobraid Árainn Theas, ó Phort Láirge, ón Rinn agus ó áiteanna mar sin.  Táimid inár gcónaí in aice le Dún Garbháin agus leis an Rinn.  B'as an Rinn do Shéamas Ó Maolchatha, a scríobh leabhar Gaeilge.  Déanaimid ár ndícheall.  Tá súil agam go bhfaighimid cabhair ón Rialtas, ó na comhairlí contaetha agus mar sin.  Déanann na comhairlí contaetha a ndícheall i rith sheachtain na Gaeilge gach bliain.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfar níos mó chun teanga, cultúr agus oidhreacht na Gaeilge a chaomhnú agus a chur chun cinn.  Tá sé mar dhualgas ar gach duine a dhícheall a dhéanamh chun an teanga a choimeád agus a dhéanamh níos flúirsí.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Déanann na scoileanna beaga sár obair chun an Ghaeilge, an cultúr agus an spórt a chur chun cinn.  Beidh áthas orm dul go dtí an seomra AV tar éis tamaill chun éisteacht leis na daltaí scoile ag cur ceisteanna ar Theachtaí agus ar Sheanadóirí.</p>

Gach uile deis a fhaigheann sé an Ghaeilge a cur ar gcúl déanann sé é.  Tá an straitéis 20 bliain caite i dtraipisí.  Níl rud ar bith á dhéanamh faoi. Ní raibh cruinniú ann le bliain anuas.

Ní treabh nó cine faoi leith iad mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ní mór an Ghaeilge a bheith ag dul ar aghaidh ar bhonn náisiúnta má táthar chun an Ghaeltacht a thabhairt slán.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">É sin ráite, tá dúshlán faoi leith roimh an Ghaeilge san nGaeltacht, go mórmhór imeasc daoine óga.  Ní mór tacaíocht láidir a thabhairt di.  Ni féidir léi fanacht go dtí go mbeidh an ghéarchéim eacnamaíochta thart.  D'fhéadfaimís teacht lá éigin go mbéadh an-rath ar an tír go heacnamúil ach go mbéadh ceann des na rudaí us luachmaire agus is saibhre atá againn, is é sin an fíor-chainteoir dhúchasach a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth theanga, ar fad imithe as an tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Is masla don Ghaeilge an socrú seo, deich nóiméad an duine.  Ag deireadh, ba mhaith liom é seo a rá faoi na cluasáin.  Gach uile sheachtain, má labhraíonn Teachta i nGaeilge sa Teach, seachas daoine ag déanamh rudaí a dhéanfaidís i bParlaimint na hEorpa nó in aon pharlaimint eile ar domhan, na cluasáin a chur orthu, maslaíonn lucht labhartha an Bhéarla nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge acu na gaeilgeoirí tré dhiúltú úsáid a bhaint as cluasáin, bíodh siad sa gcathaoir thíos nó thuas ar na binsí.  Sé an cineál dearcaidh a thógann siad ná: "Bhuel, is cuma, is i nGaeilge atá sé ag caint agus ní bhacfaimid éisteacht leis nó na cluasáin a úsáid."  Níor thuig mé riamh an meon sin.  In aon pharlaimint eile, dá mbeadh na daoine ceannann chéanna ina suí thall sa Bhruiséil, abair, ag cruinniú, mura dtuigfidís an teanga, tharraingeoidís amach na cluasáin, chuirfidís orthu iad agus d'éistfidís go cúirtéiseach leis an méid a bheadh le rá.  Is míchúirtéis amach is amach an rud a dhéanann daoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu sa tír seo, gan chluas éisteachta a thabhairt nuair atá córas aistriúcháin ann.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_255">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_321">Is mór agam an deis chun an Teach a chur ar an eolas faoi na torthaí ar chruinniú Chomhairle an Aontais Eorpaigh sa Bhruiséil Déardaoin agus Dé hAoine seo chaite, 1 agus 2 Márta.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Ar an mbeartas eacnamaíochta a bhíothas ag díriú go príomha ag cruinniú seo an earraigh den Chomhairle.  Murab ionann is cuid mhaith dár gcruinnithe sa Bhruiséil le déanaí, áfach, bhí an ceann seo suaimhneach go maith.  Ní raibh aon chúlra géarchéime ann, tar éis aontú ar an gcomhaontú nua don Ghréig ag deireadh Eanáir, aontú ar an gconradh nua agus ról gníomhach an Bhainc Cheannais Eorpaigh, agus airgead á chur ar fáil do bhainc aige anois.  Mar sin féin, cruinniú an-tábhachtach a bhí ann, don Aontas agus dá chuid ballstát araon.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Bhí an t-am againn le haghaidh plé mionsonraithe ar bheartas eacnamaíochta an Aontais Eorpaigh, go háirithe faoin mbealach le cothromaíocht a chinntiú idir leanúint leis an gcomhdhlúthú agus gníomhú chun treisiú le poist agus le fás; d'atoghamar an tUachtarán Van Rompuy, a leanfaidh ina chathaoirleach ar an gComhairle Eorpach go deireadh na Samhna 2014; bhreathnaimear ar aghaidh ar roinnt cruinnithe mullaigh idirnáisiúnta atá romhainn; agus rinneamar roinnt ceisteanna tábhachtacha idirnáisiúnta a mheas, go háirithe staid na Siria.  D'aontaíomar freisin ar stádas iarrthóra a thabhairt don tSeirbia.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Ar imeall na Comhairle, bhí mé i láthair ag an gcruinniú mullaigh sóisialta tríthaobhach agus shínigh me ar son na hÉireann an conradh nua ar chobhsaíocht, ar chomhordú agus ar rialachas san Aontas Eacnamaíoch agus Airgeadaíochta, faoi réir a dhaingnithe ag muintir na hÉireann sa reifreann atá romhainn.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Discussion on economic matters began when we first met on Thursday evening and continued over dinner.  The format facilitated a free-flowing exchange among leaders.  I am pleased to be able to tell the House that there is now a shared view around the European Council table that to enhance prospects for economic recovery in Europe, we also need to give real momentum to the drive to create jobs and promote growth.  These are the issues that matter most to the people of Europe.  I have consistently argued in favour of a balanced approach and am pleased that this has now become a real focus for our work.  We are also considering how best to step-up implementation in order that all the commitments entered into are delivered upon, and I expect this is something to which we will return at our next meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">As I told the House last week, ahead of the meeting together with 11 of my colleagues, I wrote to President Van Rompuy and President Barroso setting out eight priority areas on which action needs to be taken to drive growth in Europe.  Our letter, which was subsequently endorsed by several additional member states, formed one of the crucial inputs into our discussions on a balanced economic strategy and to our eventual conclusions on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">President Van Rompuy's issues paper was another important input.  Looking across a range of important economic indicators, it highlighted the extent and range of shared challenges which we continue to face in Europe.  Setting existing performance out in tabular form, it made it easy to see where each member state is doing well and where further improvement is required.  This underscored the fact that there can be no one-size-fits-all approach to reform and recovery.  We need a targeted and differentiated approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">At the meeting I highlighted the extent of our adjustment over the past three to four years.  I recalled that these have been painful adjustments for the Irish people, but that they have not been in vain and are now beginning to deliver real results, particularly with our return to growth last year, our strong export performance and our continuing ability to attract and retain investment from around the world.  I highlighted the importance of our very well-educated workforce, in which we have invested as a people.  Our significantly improved competitiveness position - with falls in unit labour costs and property prices - combined with a general pro-enterprise approach places us in a good position to avail of growth in our main markets.  However, we are not doing as well as we should be in a number of areas.  Apart from the overarching need to get people back to work urgently, we also need to do much more in terms of the availability of venture capital and investment in research, development and innovation.  This highlights the importance of speedily resolving the outstanding issues surrounding the European patent of which Ireland is a strong supporter.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The meeting was an important staging post in the European semester process.  We endorsed the five priorities for 2012 set out in the Commission's annual growth survey, which include growth friendly consolidation, restoring normal lending, promoting growth and competitiveness, and tackling unemployment.  These priorities will be reflected in the national reform programmes to be submitted by member states in April under the Europe 2020 strategy.  As we are a programme country, we are not obliged to submit a full national reform programme - meeting our programme targets remains our goal - but we will in any case provide a progress report.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">We also discussed preliminary findings and best practices relating to the 2011 country-specific recommendations under the semester process and commitments under the Euro Plus Pact.  We agreed that, while important measures have been taken by all member states, reforms in certain areas are lagging behind and implementation is uneven.  Furthermore, we noted that the Commission's recently published alert mechanism report points to certain challenges and potential risks of macroeconomic imbalances, and we urged the Council, the Commission and member states to act to address these issues swiftly.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">We also acknowledged that resolute action is required on unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  We called on member states to increase efforts to make it easier and more attractive for employers to hire people, to remove barriers to the creation of new jobs, and to implement active labour market policies, particularly to strengthen the participation of young people, women and older workers in the labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The Commission will shortly publish an employment package which will focus on strengthening growth through mobilising Europe's workforce, promoting job creation in key sectors, and improving management of skills needs.  Removing barriers to professional mobility will be a welcome focus.  This is another example of how the vital work we are doing at national level in Ireland through the jobs action plan can be complemented and reinforced through action at European level.  Again, this is the type of focus we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Through its meetings at the end of January and last week, the European Council has now mapped out an extensive programme of work for the period ahead, completing the Single Market, including in the digital area, and supporting our SMEs in order that more jobs can be created.  We have identified our priorities - those areas with the greatest potential to contribute to growth - many of which will be right at the top of the agenda during Ireland's Presidency in the first half of next year.  We look forward to making progress on issues that are of great concern to our businesses and our people, whether it be reducing the costs of high-speed broadband infrastructure or making it easier for people with professional qualifications to move and work across Europe.  We will seek to make life easier for businesses, including cutting the red-tape burden and advancing measures to support micro-enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">There is now a better fit between this renewed emphasis on the growth agenda at EU level and our own national emphasis through the programme for Government.  Later today, the Tánaiste and I will publish a progress report on the implementation of the programme for Government.  What we now need is to ensure implementation both at national and European level.  The House can be assured that I will be keeping the pressure up on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I therefore welcome agreement at the meeting that we can do more to ensure ownership and responsibility at the level of the European Council for driving this work forward.  More effective peer pressure has a role to play.  We have therefore asked the Commission to provide scoreboards of how we are all performing, and we have asked President Van Rompuy to ensure that progress on Single Market issues is regularly monitored by the European Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">The European Council also set the European Union's priorities for the forthcoming G20 meeting on 18 and 19 June, with a particular emphasis on growth enhancing measures and reforms.  We were also informed about preparations for the G8 Summit on 19 and 20 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The European Council underlined its strong support for an ambitious outcome at the Rio +20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development which will take place in Brazil from 20 to 22 June.  We stressed the need for strong participation by the private sector and civil society at the conference and set out some key principles to guide the EU preparations.  These include advancing the global transition towards a green economy, contributing to a strengthened global institutional framework for sustainable development, and advancing the work on global and coherent post-2015 goals for sustainable development.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The European Council considered a number of foreign policy issues, including developments in the southern neighbourhood. We made a clear statement of support for the ongoing democratic transformation which is sweeping across the European Union's southern boundaries, across North Africa and the Middle East and Gulf region.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">We also took stock of international developments, particularly the situation in Syria.  While there was not time for an in-depth discussion, the European Council agreed strong conclusions which demand that the Syrian authorities immediately stop the massive violence and human rights abuses being inflicted on the civilian population.  These actions against the people of Syria are outrageous and reprehensible.  We asked the Foreign Affairs Council to prepare further targeted sanctions against the regime in order to increase pressure on it and stated our determination to ensure those responsible for the atrocities are held accountable.  I fully support the conclusions, including the call for President Assad to step aside and the insistence that international humanitarian agencies be given access.  The European Union has mobilised humanitarian funding and stands ready to step it up as soon as conditions on the ground allow.  For its part, the Government announced on Monday that it would make up to €500,000 available to Irish Aid's partner humanitarian agencies working on the ground.  The funds will be made available to the Red Cross and UN agencies operating in Syria, as well as in neighbouring countries such as Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon.  The European Council will continue to support international efforts to end the violence and meet the considerable humanitarian needs in Syria, including by the Arab League, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan who is the joint special envoy of the United Nations and the Arab League, and the Friends of the Syrian People Group which held its first meeting on 24 February in Tunis, at which Ireland was represented by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The European Council noted with concern the deteriorating situation of human rights in Belarus.  We welcomed the decision in January by the Foreign Affairs Council to extend the list of those subject to ED sanctions, including a visa ban and asset freeze, not only to those responsible for the repression of civil society and the democratic opposition but also to those supporting or benefiting from their association with the Lukashenko regime.  The European Council invited the Foreign Affairs Council to proceed with its work on further measures and underlined its support for the democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Following on from consideration by the Foreign Affairs Council and the General Affairs Council earlier in the week, the European Council agreed to grant the status of candidate country to Serbia.  I very much welcome this step as recognition of the work done.  In December we set three conditions which focused on moving forward the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue which attempts to normalise relations between the two parties.  I am pleased to report that sufficient progress was made to satisfy member states of the bona fides of the Serbian Government and its engagement with Kosovo.  Candidate status is, of course, just the first step on the road to EU membership.  A further decision by the European Council will be required to open accession negotiations.  With parliamentary elections due in Serbia in May, I do not expect much more movement on this issue until after the summer.  Nevertheless, this decision is concrete assurance for the Serb people of their future within the European Union.  After a decade of conflict followed by a decade of recovery and stalemate, we are seeing a serious commitment on the part of Serbia to a future in the Union.  Ireland will continue to support Serbia's European perspective, as we do for all the countries of the western Balkans.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I was delighted to join my colleagues in re-electing Herman Van Rompuy to serve as President of the European Council for a further two and a half years.  We have been very fortunate to have President Van Rompuy at the helm during the very difficult past two years and his continued leadership is to be warmly welcomed.  Those of us in the euro area also agreed that he should be the first President of the euro summit.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">While in Brussels, I also attended the tripartite social summit held on Thursday morning last, ahead of the European Council.  The attendance included representatives of both the ICTU and IBEC.  I was accompanied at this meeting by the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  This was an important opportunity to engage with EU social partners and our discussions focussed on social dialogue as a key instrument for restoring growth and jobs.  This was Ireland's first formal obligation as Presidency in waiting of the Council in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">As I announced in the Dáil, I also took part in the ceremony last Friday morning in which the new stability treaty was signed.  Of course, signature is a separate matter from ratification which will, as the Government announced last week, require the consent of the people in a referendum.  I took the opportunity during the meeting last Thursday night to inform my European Council colleagues of the Government's decision.  They appreciated my briefing but were very clear that, while they wished to see Ireland ratify the tratify, this was a matter for Ireland and its people.  I look forward to the campaign ahead and putting the strong case for ratification to the people.  I signed the treaty last Friday because I fundamentally believe it is in Ireland's national interest to do so, as it will represent another important step on the road towards recovery.  It will also build on the steady progress the country has made in the past year.  This progress has seen international and investor confidence in Ireland rising, leading to many new investments that will create new jobs for the people.  I want this flow of investment to continue and expand.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Within a currency union such as the eurozone it is manifestly in the interests of all that each member pursues responsible budgetary policies.  The crisis has brought home to all that the action, or inaction, of one member can have highly significant and detrimental consequences for the rest of the currency union.  The Government is deeply committed to getting Ireland's finances back on track and reducing our debt to more sustainable levels.  This is work we would be doing in the interests of the people with or without the new treaty.  It is the only responsible way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">We are determined to restore our economic sovereignty and return to borrowing on the open markets.  We do not want to be subject to a programme for a second longer than is necessary.  Having a stable and secure environment is the best way to achieve this and the treaty will make an important contribution in that regard.  Not least, it will ensure those who choose to ratify will have access to the ESM.  It is my intention to lead Ireland out of our programme.  Having an insurance policy in place - ensuring continuing access to a stream of funding - will increase the confidence of investors and lenders in doing business with Ireland.  This can only contribute to our recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I look forward to making the strong case for ratification to the people and ensuring that this time they will be provided with adequate information in order that they will be abe to make an informed decision when they vote.  This is an opportunity for Ireland to send a strong message about where it is going and where it wants to be, that it is strong and confident, and backed by a stable and secure currency.  Ratifying the treaty will be another important step forward in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">There will be ample time in the period ahead to argue the merits of the treaty.  However, I can point to one key distinction that marks it out as being different from the EU treaties we have ratified.  On this occasion only 12 ratifications are required for the treaty to enter into force.  That means, in very simple terms, our decision is for ourselves alone.  A decision to participate will, without question, be welcomed by our partners, but if we decide not to do so, they will move ahead without us.  The choice is ours and ours alone.  It will have significant implications for our future position and role at the heart of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I very much welcome the focus and outcome of last week's meeting of the European Council.  Our conclusions represent important progress across a broad range of issues from job creation and growth and the conclusion of the first phase of this year's European semester to preparations for a range of forthcoming international summits and pressing foreign policy concerns.  We have set out an ambitious programme of work, and  delivery and implementation are key.  After recent meetings, I am more confident that we now have the right focus and direction.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_357">Cé nach raibh cúlra géarchéime taobh thiar den chruinniú seo an tseachtain seo caite, i mo thuairim, is oth liom a rá, níor thuig ceannairí na hEorpa cé chomh práinneach is atá an sceál fós ó thaobh cúrsaí eacnamaíochta de, go háirithe easpa creidmheasa, mar a dúirt mé ar maidin, do chomhlachtaí beaga agus meánmhéide, ní amháin ar fud na tíre seo ach ar fud na hEorpa.  Nílim sásta ón méid a tharla gur thuig daoine go bhfuil sé riachtanach i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh chun níos mó tacaíochta a thabhairt do na comhlachtaí seo ionas go rachaidh cúrsaí eacnamaíochta i bhfeabhas.  Ní léir ó na cinntí a rinneadh an tseachtain seo caite go bhfuil sin ag tarlú.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Thankfully, last week's European summit had none of the sense of panic which gripped many of last year's gatherings.  Unfortunately, it also lacked any great sense of urgency.  Nothing on the agenda would suggest that this was a gathering of leaders whose countries are slipping back into recession and who continue to face an unprecedented debt crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The summit's conclusions contain many big claims concerning action under way, but little detail to provide optimism.  It remains the case that the European Union has no credible growth agenda and is at best delaying, rather than preventing, further a major crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The heads of eurozone countries issued a separate statement which directly mentioned a number of big issues facing the block including the new programme of support for Greece.  The early indications are that the programme will not succeed.  The debt level which Greece will have after the restructuring of its debt is still too high and the absence of any potential investment for growth means the target figures are almost impossible to meet.  There is a real need for the Union to step in with a significant increase in its support for growth enhancing measures.  There is no doubt that Greece needs to remove a wide range of practices which have undermined its ability to grow.  However, their removal is not enough.  A real chance for Greece to recover requires other special measures, which should include an increase in its EU budget allocation and special funding for business investment by the European Investment Bank.  The sacrifices of the Greek people and the commitment of their Government must be recognised.  I hope the Taoiseach will take the opportunity to reject publicly the damaging and disgraceful attacks on Greece which have emanated from the usual anonymous sources in different capitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">At the end of their five-paragraph statement, the leaders of the eurozone countries included the sentence that they "recall their determination to do whatever is needed to ensure the financial stability of the euro area as a whole, and their readiness to act accordingly."  Throughout this crisis the language of action has been devalued dramatically.  Each statement of resolute determination has been followed by the reality of entrenched orthodoxies.  Pre-crisis policy positions have changed but fundamental red lines remains intact in spite of clear evidence of the need for a more radical departure.  If it is genuinely true that the euro leaders have a determination and readiness to ensure the financial stability of the zone, then a much more assertive agenda is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">As I stated repeatedly over the past year, lasting financial and economic stability in the eurozone can only come when the design flaws of the euro have been fixed.  These include the need for a much larger budget to address national economic shocks, a reform of the ECB and strong central regulation of the financial sector.  None of these points is even been mentioned, let alone addressed.  I will return to this wider reform agenda later.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Fianna Fáil welcomes the signature of the fiscal treaty on Friday, not because it is the answer to Europe's problems but because it is only one part of the answer.  It was not a good day for the Union that two member states were not present for the signing.  The fault for this is to be shared equally between those who were pushing the treaty but made little effort to achieve unanimity and those who were looking for an opportunity to appease real or imagined eurosceptic opinions.  There is nothing in this treaty which affects either Britain or the Czech Republic.  Their failure to sign it is a demonstration once again that eurosceptics can find threats in anything at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">For Ireland, the lack of unanimity in the signing of the treaty at least demonstrates that this is not a typical European Union treaty.  Every EU treaty requires every country to ratify it before it can come into effect.  This maximises the potential negotiating position of each country and it also makes leaders more respectful of each other's positions.  There is no such requirement for the fiscal treaty.  We do not have a veto power over its operation.  Therefore, the question for Ireland is a much simpler one: is it good for Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_365">I believe that there is a positive and practical case for the treaty which must be made if the current high level of support for ratification is to be maintained.  There are serious downsides to voting "No", but Ministers should back off their default position of emphasising the negative consequences of a "No" vote.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, predicted the collapse of the euro.  The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, called this a wise statement and others have spoken of colossal damage.  Let us not get sucked into the game of the sceptics who have already undermined their case by the shrill prophecies of doom which they have been trotting out in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Equally, Ministers should remember that they can not pass this purely with voters of their own party.  They need to put aside the sharp partisanship which characterises most of their public comments and adopt a more consensual and credible approach.  Speeches dominated by such nonsense as the claim to have transformed Ireland and its international standing are not winning them votes and are getting in the way of setting out a coherent case for the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">There are two major benefits for Ireland in this treaty which are enough in themselves to achieve a strong "Yes" vote.  First, it will provide Ireland with a major reserve which can be called upon to keep funding State services if the financial markets will not lend to us.  At the weekend, one Sinn Féin representative made the ridiculous statement that Europe would just have to give us the money if we needed it, whether or not we vote for the treaty.  This is part and parcel of a deeply cynical politics which claims it can make all problems go away with no consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Second, the framework of the treaty and the potential to access ESM funding will make access to market funding easier and cheaper.  In fact, if the ESM facility had been available in 2010, it is highly likely that Ireland would not have needed any international help.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The various left-wing parties in the House, opponents and their allies outside the House have been arguing that this should be termed the "austerity" treaty.  In fact, exactly the opposite is true.  Ireland needs to borrow money, not only to finance deficit spending but also re-finance existing borrowing.  The cost of that borrowing will have a bigger impact on the money available for public services than anything in this treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">No-one can question the basic fact that the availability of the ESM facility will give greater confidence in the market for State debt.  Greater confidences means lower interest rates and lower interest rates mean more money for public services.  If one takes the most conservative estimate possible and assumes that the treaty and ESM back-stop will reduce the interest rate on Irish debt by 1% over time, that is more than €1 billion every year which will not have to be paid in interest.  That is a large benefit to Irish taxpayers which will be available before any of the other provisions of the treaty have an impact.  It is the exact opposite of the increased austerity which the treaty's opponents claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">On fiscal rules, we should note how common they are in countries which have welfare states and standards of living which many here envy.  In Sweden, for example, the social democratic party in government viewed fiscal rules as the protector of the welfare state, not its threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">One element we do not need in the debate here is the distraction of false claims suggesting that these rules would have prevented the crisis.  In the decade before the crisis, the European Commission never suggested that there was a structural deficit here, and actually praised fiscal policy.  The "never again" argument does not stand up to even basic scrutiny and it takes time away from much stronger arguments.  During last week's debates, quite a few speakers referred to the issue of the promissory notes.  They have nothing to do with this treaty and are not available to us as a bargaining tool in seeking a reduction in their cost.  There should and will be a significant move in the cost of the promissory notes.  They were required purely because Ireland was acting in the interests of the wider European financial system and they are structured in a way which is completely different from normal sovereign debt.  It is this different structure which makes changes relatively easy.  The European Central Bank can in the morning lift the bulk of the burden of the notes without any risk of contagion.  Equally, no one can credibly argue that lengthening the term and changing the payment conditions of the notes will have any other significant impact on the wider European economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">This is a Government which is today claiming to have skilfully negotiated the reduction in interest rates on the bailout even though the reduction was four times what is was asking for and is available to every country receiving funds.  If the one-year briefings to journalists are any guide, it will run out of superlatives in praising itself when the promissory note reduction comes.  In truth, a lot of time was wasted last year by the failure to put the issue on the agenda of any significant meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">As I have said consistently for months, there is nothing to fear from holding this referendum.  As was shown in the revised Lisbon proposal, the pro-EU position can actually grow during a referendum campaign.  The key is to talk to people directly and put a positive case.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The Taoiseach has talked repeatedly about a number of growth measures agreed at this summit.  Individually, they are welcome.  Ireland will benefit from the measures if they are agreed as legally enforceable actions rather than declarations of good intentions.  However, the measures taken together are not actually a growth agenda.  They are a slight quickening of the pace of measures already under way, which will have a marginal impact on growth and competitiveness.  For example, the European research area is a great idea but there is nowhere near enough money in its budget to have a major impact, nor is there any discussion of providing it with enough funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">There was a lot of choreography before the summit, with Prime Ministers combining to call for things to be agreed which were already likely to be agreed.  Each has then been in a position to give speeches about how they are tabling papers and pushing a growth agenda.  A genuine growth agenda requires a much more radical discussion and one which includes addressing the core flaws in the design of the euro.  What we need now is to push for this more radical discussion to begin and be used as the basis of the new treaty, which is due within five years at the most.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">On page 8 of the summit's conclusions it is stated that it was agreed to carry forward work on a range of tax measures, including the financial transactions tax and the common consolidated corporate tax base.  Neither of these taxes has any place on the agenda of an organisation which is focused purely on getting through the crisis and returning to growth.  The G8 and G20 summits will be important in developing international co-ordination.  It is already clear that the non-EU members of these groups are deeply impatient with the fact Europe refuses to use all of its resources to tackle its own crisis.  Several of the larger members of the Union are members of these groups, as is the Union itself.  There is a real need for the Union to have a distinct position at these meetings and not allow a situation where national positions are presented as European ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I welcome the extension of candidate status to Serbia.  President Tadić and his Government have made enormous strides in a very short time.  I hope their progress through the accession process will be as fast as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">There is a growing sense of drift in regard to the neighbourhood policy, with little urgency evident in the Union's work.  Now is not the time to back off from the task of challenging our near neighbours to adhere to democratic standards and to work with them on development.  In particular, the situation in the Ukraine is becoming grave.  As we have recently seen in regard to one case relevant to Ireland, the legal system is backing off from basic protection for international investment.  Domestically, the situation is much more serious.  The imprisoning of Ms Yulia Tymoshenko, the lengthy term she has been given and the conditions she is being held in are unacceptable.  We need to speak clearly and in a united voice to the Ukrainian Administration: adhere to basic democratic norms or there will be consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The situation in Syria continues to get worse by the day.  The strong words of the summit are welcome but not enough for the besieged communities of Homs, where the scale of slaughter by the regime is clearly escalating.  Russia and others have played a deeply dishonourable role in giving comfort to the regime and vetoing international action through the United Nations.  Europe must introduce comprehensive sanctions against every element of the regime and those who support it, and should prepare direct aid for the opposition.  The recognition of the Syrian National Council is welcome and every state should support it.  The people of Syria are demanding their freedom and they will not be denied.  In the face of gruesome repression, they are making unimaginable sacrifices.  Europe must stand with them in every possible way.</p>

          <p eId="para_381">My copy of the Taoiseach's statement had an extra page appended to it.  While I am not sure it is usual, it is an almost idiosyncratic way of undermining his remarks because it tells us it was composed by a person, updated by a person and modified by a person.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
          <p eId="para_383">I thought I would share that with the Taoiseach as part of the little foibles of this institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">As the Taoiseach knows, this crisis is about more than economics, bank bailouts and promissory notes to criminal banks; it is about people.  The choices Fine Gael and Labour, like Fianna Fáil before them, are making are putting unbearable pressure on our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The evidence is all around us.  As we discussed earlier, I heard it last Friday in Mayo from rural dwellers who are at breaking point as a consequence of the Taoiseach's commitment to austerity.  It is his policies which are stripping local communities of essential services – schools, guidance counsellors, hospitals, teachers, post offices and Garda stations.  The Government is also adding new stealth taxes such as the universal social charge, the household charge, VAT increases, motor tax increases and septic tank charges.  Almost 500,000 citizens are unemployed and, by the Government's own estimate, that figure will have changed little by 2015.  Small indigenous business, including small farmers, with no real support from the Government or credit from the banks, are going under.  Natural resources are given away and now State assets are to be sold off.  A whole generation of young people are being forced to leave.  This GAA generation is playing our Gaelic games in Brisbane, Birmingham and Baltimore instead of in their own parishes.  All of this will worsen if the treaty the Taoiseach signed last week in Brussels is ratified.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Deputy Micheál Martin - the three "Yes" men of Europe - are asking the citizens to support a treaty that will enshrine the policies of austerity into our Constitution in perpetuity.  Deputy Kenny said he wanted to be the Taoiseach who restored economic sovereignty to this State, but this treaty will achieve the opposite.  It will seriously undermine what remains of Irish sovereignty by surrendering important fiscal and budgetary matters to unelected and unaccountable EU officials in the European Court of Justice and the European Commission.  These institutions will be allowed to impose harsh economic policies on democratically elected Governments and to impose heavy fines where they believe these policies have not been adhered to.  The Commission is also given new powers to impose economic partnership programmes on states in breach of its debt and deficit rules.  These will be programmes of so-called structural reform similar to those in the current EU-IMF austerity programme, even where a member state is borrowing on ordinary terms from the international bond market.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">By placing these rules and enforcement mechanisms in an international treaty and giving it the protection of the Constitution, the Government clearly intends to make these obligations permanent and to straitjacket future Governments and their ability to adopt different strategies.  This is unacceptable.  Three months ago, the Government stripped €3.8 billion out the economy, which caused real hardship.  It is already committed to slashing a further €8.6 billion from the economy in the next three years to meet the troika deficit programme target of 3%.  However, the austerity treaty now demands an additional structural deficit rule of 0.5%, which means a further €6 billion in cuts and new taxes will be imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">This does not add up.  More austerity deepens the recession, increases the deficit and makes economic recovery more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The citizens of this State simply cannot afford this policy and this treaty.  As part of this process the Government also agreed that ratification of the fiscal austerity treaty is necessary to access emergency funding from the European stability mechanism, ESM.  The Taoiseach could have tried to stop this linkage but it was his choice and he chose not to.  Now he is calling on citizens to vote for the austerity treaty to ensure access to the ESM in the future.  The Taoiseach is also saying this is about "whether we wish to participate in the European community, the euro and the eurozone".  That is no more than a cynical attempt to bully voters into supporting a bad treaty.  It is also an empty threat.  We cannot be expelled from the eurozone or the European Union.  The Taoiseach knows that.  He also knows the European Council will not refuse emergency funding to any eurozone member state in the future, irrespective of its position on the austerity treaty.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">Éist liom.  To do so would be to break the commitment given at the European Council summit of 21 July 2011 when the leaders said they were "determined to continue to provide support to countries under programmes until they have regained market access, provided they successfully implement those programmes."</p>
          <p eId="para_392">It would also have a devastating impact on the eurozone as a whole, if they did the contrary to what has been outlined, something no EU politician would be willing to risk.  The policies of bank bailouts, promissory notes and crippling austerity, supported by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, have failed.  There is an alternative which, once again, I commend to the Taoiseach.  He should use the National Pensions Reserve Fund with its €5.3 billion to invest in jobs and growth.  He should combine this with the resources of the European Investment Bank and utilise that to invest in various projects to get people back to work and to reinvigorate the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">We must cleanse the European banking system of toxic debts through a new round of rigorous stress tests and deleveraging followed by recapitalisation, where necessary, funded by the European Central Bank.  The Taoiseach is negotiating the terms of the payment of interest rates and other elements of our debt but he must do much more than he has done.  He must call a halt to the €3.1 billion annual payment to Anglo Irish Bank which will cost Irish taxpayers up to €76 billion before it concludes in 20 years' time.  Extending the time will not help.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Next week Sinn Féin will launch a detailed analysis of the Government's austerity treaty outlining our alternative strategy for stabilising the economy, creating employment and reducing the State's debt and deficit.  I will send copies to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  In the referendum campaign Sinn Féin will ask citizens to reject the treaty.

          <p eId="para_403">I wish to deal first with the comments of Deputy Micheál Martin, who referred to Sinn Féin's position on the treaty campaign as cynical.  To be honest I find it amusing because I remember the then Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Mr. Dick Roche, Deputy Martin's Cabinet colleague, say there would not be a second vote on the Lisbon treaty.  He assured people they would have only one bite of the cherry and that there would not be a second vote.  He then went on to lead us into a second campaign when the Government did not get the answer it wanted the first time.  That is very cynical.  In the second campaign the economic crisis had just begun to emerge and people were deeply alarmed and fearful for their future.  The campaign slogan was "Yes for jobs, yes for growth, yes for prosperity".  We now know what all of those assurances got us.  I call that deeply cynical.  We in Sinn Féin are not going to take lectures from Deputy Micheál Martin about cynicism because the evidence is that as the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and a senior member of Fianna Fáil he played a significant role in those two campaigns.  He should not use such words as "cynical" because we can get copies of his quotes and statements if he wants.  It would be advisable for Deputy Martin to move away from name-calling.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The Government never dreamt it would be in this position.  It sought to avoid a referendum by all means.  In the negotiations the two things that were achieved - or conceded - by our negotiators were, first, the insertion of the words "preferably constitutional", which was obviously aimed at avoiding a referendum, and acknowledged as such by the Tánaiste.  Second, we had the insistence of Mrs. Angela Merkel's government that a stick would be introduced to beat our people with on conditionality such that we could not access the European stability mechanism funding unless we agreed to the treaty.  That is what the Government achieved in order to try to avoid putting the proposition to the people and to give Mrs. Angela Merkel's government a stick to beat us with if we did find ourselves in that position.  That is some achievement.  It is a remarkable betrayal of the people by the Government in those negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Unfortunately for the Government the first part has not worked, as after much deliberation the Attorney General has reported back that the Government has no choice but to put the treaty before the people.  Sinn Féin received considerable legal advice and we would have taken the Government to court if necessary.  We believe we would have achieved the same outcome.  The Government has done what it did not want to do and now we are in the middle of a campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">In considering the conclusions of the European Council I am conscious that I am speaking as the Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party is present in the Chamber.  The conclusions are all about right wing politics.  Mr. Fintan O'Toole is considered to be a left wing commentator, someone the Labour grassroots would read assiduously every week to get their direction on the way the country is going.  He reported that the treaty outlaws Keynesianism.  It enshrines right wing ideology and a right wing view of how we should run our affairs across Europe.  The more one looks at it the more shocking it is that any member of the Labour Party in this country, or anyone who is part of the left historically in Europe, could agree to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Point No. 9 of the conclusions refers to shifting taxes away from labour.  That sounds good; that it will take the weight off working people but one must ask whether we are going to have wealth taxes.  Are we going to ask those at the higher level to pay their fair share?  It does not; what it means is that we are going to cut public services and the welfare state across Europe.  Why does it not say that when that is what it means?  There is a right wing intent.  The conclusions also refer to increased efforts to make it easier and more attractive for employers to hire people where necessary by improving wage-setting mechanisms.  That reads well but one can translate it to mean reduced wages and making it easier to sack people.  An unravelling of the social Europe is taking place as we speak by the very people who caused the crisis - the right wing ideologues.  Point No. 15 refers to a reduction in the administration and regulatory burdens at EU and national level and the removal of barriers to the creation of new jobs.  That translates to a recipe for light-touch regulation, which is more right wing ideology.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I can understand Fine Gael, whose history is as an avowedly right wing party, supporting the conclusions but for the life of me I cannot understand how the Labour Party could sign up to this power grab by the right in Europe.  If the Tánaiste is not happy with my assessment of matters he should look at the comments of his MEPs.  We are being told the treaty will formalise the six pack and various other measures to which we have agreed and that this is a good way to run our affairs.  However, this is not what Labour Party MEPs are saying and we will be quoting their comments to the public during the course of the referendum campaign.  We will also be quoting them and the damning analysis of the treaty by Mr. Jack O'Connor, a Labour Party member and senior trade unionist, to the Labour Party grassroots.  At some point the Labour Party will have to question its reason for supporting the approach being taken to tackling the crisis.  I do not think it believes in that approach;  I hope it does not.  What we are witnessing is a right-wing revolution which outlaws Keynesian economics, the potential of a government to stimulate an economy, to intervene in a recession or counter the cycle, which has always been the position of the left.  This has been our approach to addressing crises since the Second World War.  Mr. Fintan O'Toole summarised this best yesterday and it must have been painful for Labour Party members to read his analysis.  The Labour Party will have to endure a lot more pain during this campaign because we will be reminding the grassroots, its members and the people what it stated previously in comparison with its enthusiastic support for the treaty.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">I thank the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for making time available for us to debate the outcome of the summit.  While I was interested in what the Taoiseach had to say, he did not mention the elephant in the room which must have been hanging over him at the summit, namely, the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes which were conspicuous by their absence.  The report from Brussels mentions at length matters which are not the subject of this debate and omits the matter which is consuming the interests of the people who are interested in hearing - it is obvious something is about to happen - what deal will be made on the promissory notes and how it will affect our relationship with the European Union and the referendum.  Regardless of how often members of the Government - it is obvious not all members agree with the treaty - dissemble or pretend that the two issues are not related, they are related in the public mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">There is no doubt but that if the Government gets a good deal on the promissory notes, it will have a better chance of getting the treaty through in a referendum and it should not be ashamed or coy about this.  If it is seeking a better deal on the promissory notes, it should be trumpeting this from the roof tops.  If it succeeds, it will be easier for it to sell the treaty to the people in a referendum and acknowledge that the promissory notes should never have been given in the first place.  Let us be honest and make the connection.  This is what is going to happen.  It is welcome that there will, undoubtedly, be an announcement by the Government on the promissory notes.  I have no doubt that this announcement will affect the timing of the referendum, as stated by the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">Like any sensible person, I will study the terms attached to any deal.  The Government must first acknowledge that the two issues are related, following which it will be better able to sell the treaty in a referendum.  There is a direct relationship between the two issues, just as there is a direct relationship between the public sector cuts made and any relief the Government might receive on the promissory notes.  This is an important and relevant issue and I wish people would stop pretending that it is not.  This pretence is based on the fear and trepidation of European leaders.  I regret that in every speech he makes on this issue the Taoiseach feels it necessary to pay tribute to one leader or another and say the EuropeaN Union would welcome this or that.  We should not feel compelled on all occasions to pay tribute to Mr. Von Rompuy, as the Taoiseach did, and say the European Union would welcome our participation in this treaty.  Of course, it would welcome it.  If that is the case, let us ask it for something in return.  It would not only welcome our participation in the treaty, it also believes it is vital because the treaty was drawn up specifically for countries such as Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy.  If it wants us to sign up to it, it should give us something in return for our support.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Taoiseach mentioned a relevant and interesting matter.  He said that if we were to sign the treaty, we would have access to the ESM.  One can see from a mile off that this will be the main selling point of the treaty.  The focus of those on the "Yes" side and the "No" side will be the ESM and whether we will have access to ESM funds.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">I will finish on this point.  The Taoiseach went on to say that if we were to sign the treaty, investors and lenders would have increased confidence in doing business in Ireland.  I suggest he is conceding that there will be a second bailout, as was made absolutely clear by Moody's and other objective commentators in the past few days.  We are preparing for a second bailout, but the Government is stating nothing about it, just as it is stating nothing about the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_418">It is an incredible indictment of the weakness of the Government's position that the best reason advanced by the Taoiseach for voting in favour of signing the treaty is that if we do not, Ireland will be frozen out in terms of access to funds in the future.  We all know that the reason is the insertion of the so-called blackmail amendment.  Even if the Taoiseach did not initiate that provision, it is clear he consented to same.  This is akin to the Government giving someone a gun and then running a campaign stating it must defend itself because it is afraid it will be shot.  What is worse is that while the treaty which includes that clause has not yet been put before the House, the Government is acting as though it is already in place.  I have no doubt that the Government is working feverishly behind the scenes to secure a deal on the promissory notes so as to make the vote on the treaty more enticing.  Even if all of the promissory notes were written off, the treaty should still be rejected.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Despite what other colleagues have said, including Deputy Micheál Martin who now appears to be a great supporter of the Labour Party's position on the treaty, this is an austerity treaty.  One only has to read the text to realise this is true.  In this regard I refer to some of the provisions of the treaty, in particular the one highlighted by the media again today on the balanced budget rule contained in Article 3 which requires a structural deficit of 0.5%.  This target, if exceeded, will trigger cutbacks, extra taxes and penalties and fines by the European Court of Justice of in the region of €150 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">No one can define "structural deficit".  The figure differs depending on to whom one speaks.  The IMF's position differs from that of the European Commission and so on.  Who will make the decision?  As stated in today's edition of the <i>Financial Times </i>by Mr. Martin Wolf, it is akin to putting an immeasurable concept into law, which is mad.  The Government is proposing to hand over responsibility for making the decision on what the target will be to the Commission.  We know that Ireland will not have to abide by this clause until after 2014 when it comes out of the bailout process.  However, according to the Department of Finance, by 2015 Ireland will be running a deficit of 3.7%.  The Government wants us to vote for the treaty which enshrines a 0.5% target which, as has been outlined, will result in an extra €5.7 billion being taken out of economy which is already stagnating and coming to a halt because of austerity.  Article 4, the debt reduction provision, similarly requires a massive amount of money to be taken out of the economy.  Did the Council consider that the impact of its austerity measures will be pretty much as it already has been, namely, European economies grinding to a halt, massive unemployment and severe conditions for ordinary people?  Moreover, this is not once-off austerity.  What is being proposed here, through provisions of binding force and permanent character, is an ending of any expansionary fiscal policies.  A Labour Party Government that seeks to put into law a measure that would outlaw economic policies - even Keynesian, let alone socialist policies would be outlawed in the future - reflects the huge journey the Irish Labour Party has taken almost 100 years since its inception.  Not only is this proposal ideologically flawed, it also is practically flawed and constitutes bad economics.  It is bad for the economies of Europe and is bad for Ireland because it would stop any programme of meaningful public investment and public works against a backdrop in which thousands of people are queueing overnight on the streets of Cork to leave this country to find employment elsewhere.  At a time when the private sector is failing to invest, despite increased profits, the only area from which investment can come is public expenditure and Government funding but, in essence, the Government is attempting to seal off that avenue.  This treaty is a disaster and should be opposed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_421">There is a grand deception at the heart of both the Government's description of the events at the European Council meeting of 1 and 2 March and the Council meeting itself, because the Council meeting is packaged with lots of pious and noble phrases about jobs, growth-friendly consolidation, restoring normal lending, promoting growth and tackling unemployment.  One must talk about such matters because they really affect hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland and tens of millions of people across Europe.  These are the issues that must be addressed but which absolutely are not being addressed.  While one gets such pious phrases to make people think something is being done about those issues that really affect them, the heart of what actually happened at the Council meeting comprised signing up to a treaty that will inflict Greek-style disaster on the rest of Europe.  It will spread it across Europe to Ireland and other European countries.  A sort of Orwellian doublespeak lies at the heart of what the Government and European leaders are doing, as well as at the heart of the fiscal treaty and all the so-called bailout programmes.  While one hears talk of bailout, solidarity, assisting other states and of stability and growth, in fact a brutal austerity attack is being planned on the living standards and public services of working people, young people and the unemployed across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">This attack already has devastated Greece, which has led to hundreds of thousands of people being driven out of their jobs, the slashing of the incomes of workers and the poor by approximately 20%, the making homeless of tens of thousands of people and the robbery by multinationals of the state assets and enterprises of Greece.  This has produced an economic collapse of 7% in Greece, with a similar collapse predicted this year.  All this is being done simply to protect the bondholders and the banks which turned the European economy into a casino economy.  This treaty now proposes to extend the same destructive logic to the rest of Europe, lock it in legally and preclude governments from doing anything other than inflicting such savage austerity on ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">On the one hand, the treaty states that under no circumstances can one borrow to finance job creation, economic development or growth.  As other speakers have noted, from henceforth that will be banned.  On the other hand, it is insisted that this country, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and anyone else who has debt problems must borrow to pay off the debts of the bankers and gamblers.  It is a classic example of there being one law for the rich and another for the rest of us.  The banks and bondholders must be protected, as must the euro, and if that means sacrificing the jobs, living standards and the economic social future of this country and the rest of Europe, then so be it.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I find it extraordinary that at the heart of the statement to emerge from this gathering, the Government somehow has managed to twist it so that a crisis caused by private financial institutions has something to do with public spending and deficits.  This is not the reason we are in economic crisis.  Spain and Ireland had budget surpluses before the crisis.  Having a balanced budget would have made no difference to the question of whether this economy would have plunged into crisis.  It was because of the activities of the banks yet it is those banks the Government seeks to protect.  It makes ordinary people pay and robs them of the ability to emerge from the economic crisis.</p>

        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_425">I note that yesterday, the EU statistics office, EUROSTAT, released figures showing a collapse in household spending, exports and manufacturing that has taken the life out of the eurozone economy in the final months of 2011.  Output within the eurozone shrank by 0.3% from the third quarter.  Government cuts, increasing indirect taxation and rising unemployment are having a devastating effect on many parts of Europe and there is little doubt but that austerity will neither spur growth nor boost employment.  One did not really expect it to so do and it is disingenuous to try to suggest it will.  Many problems exist with regard to the structure within Europe and if European monetary policy is run according to German interests, structural imbalances will remain.  In this context, why do the Germans not drive up wages, increase domestic consumption and import more?  That would help to even out some of the Continent's imbalances and would be more productive in the long term than driving austerity down the necks of the countries on the periphery.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">This austerity is so devastating that I note the Spanish Prime Minister this week stated that Spain would not meet the 4.4% target but was aiming for a target of a deficit of 5.8%.  Moreover, he did not announce this at the Council meeting last Friday but stated it was none of the Council's business as it was a sovereign matter.  That is interesting and could be a new development.  Moreover, the Dutch, who have been one of the cheerleaders for austerity, now acknowledge they will not reach the deficit target of 3% over the next three years.  Instead, they predict deficits of 4.5%, 4.1% and 3.3% in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.  Will the Dutch be fined because they are going to break the rules?  Fines are supposed to be imposed on them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_428">I acknowledge it is a different programme but the Dutch programme states they were meant to reach a target of 3% for each of the next three years.  Consequently, they now are in line for a fine.  The Dutch had calculated they would need €18 billion in cuts, spread over the next four years, to meet their 3% target but they now will be obliged to make cuts of €15 billion next year alone.  It will be interesting to see whether the Dutch will impose €15 billion in cuts next year to meet the targets to which they were signed up, as they are meant to be fined.  Moreover, given the Netherlands was one of the countries next to Germany in respect of performance, it will be extremely interesting for the rest of us to see whether the rules will apply to the Dutch in that manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">There is little doubt but that things cannot continue the way they are at present.  Austerity will not solve the problems and to reiterate a point I made in the Chamber yesterday when discussing Greece, the cuts sadly have left one in five unemployed, which has driven up the suicide rate by 40%.  The European crisis is about more than economics, as there is a huge human cost and Members do not need me to outline all the results and social consequences of such cuts, because they are dramatic.  Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain are already feeling the effects of the cuts that have been made and they are beginning to have an impact in Italy.  The Italian people do not know what is going to hit them.  The Germans will be obliged to engage in a serious U-turn because the medicine they have prescribed may be good for their country but it is certainly not good for others.</p>

Is he concerned that it is going to be extremely difficult to hold the referendum prior to the summer?</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The Taoiseach alluded to the growth measures included in the communiqué issued in the aftermath of the summit.  It must be noted that these are measures rather than enforceable actions.  In addition, the budget that would be required to enable the country to benefit enormously from these measures is not in place.  Will the Tánaiste elaborate further on the position in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_433">It has been our contention for some considerable period that in order to bring about lasting financial and economic stability, the initial design flaws in the euro must be addressed and the ECB must be reformed in a fundamental way.  Was this matter discussed at the summit and does the Tánaiste have any comments to make on it?  What does he envisage happening in respect of it in the future?</p>
          <p eId="para_434">It was stated in the conclusions published after the summit that further work will be done in respect of a range of tax measures, including the CCCTB and financial transaction taxes.  Neither of the latter would be in the interests of Ireland's economic development.  In addition, initiatives of this nature would be questionable in the context of overall European growth at this juncture.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The Tánaiste will attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade this afternoon to discuss the situation in Syria.  The crisis in that country is deepening.  One is obliged to express grave concerns about suggestions put forward by Senator John McCain and others in recent days that the US should consider launching air strikes against Syria.  Will the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste use the opportunity afforded them by their upcoming visit to the United States to raise this matter with the authorities there?</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
          <p eId="para_436">Deputy Ó Fearghaíl raised quite a number of issues.  On the promissory notes and the point raised earlier by Deputy Ross, the Government was, prior to any discussion on the fiscal compact treaty, already engaged in a process of negotiation on those notes.  That process is quite separate from that relating to the fiscal compact and we intend to ensure this remains the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">In the context of the establishment of the Referendum Commission, I am sure everyone will agree that there is a need for a reasoned debate on the treaty.  By that I mean people should engage in a debate on what is actually contained in the treaty and on the nature and significance of the treaty itself.  It is important that sufficient time be made available for that debate.  Earlier this week, the Government engaged in an initial discussion with regard to the approach we might take in respect of the referendum.  As a consequence of that discussion, I will bring a memorandum to the Government in the near future in respect of both the establishment of the Referendum Commission and the introduction of the necessary legislation.  A referendum Bill will be required and this must be brought forward.  The Government has not yet decided when the referendum will be held.  However, it will address that matter shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Deputy Boyd Barrett stated that the references in the communiqué to growth and jobs are mere words.  If we had not succeeded in ensuring the inclusion of a commitment on growth and jobs in the conclusions, certain Members would be humming a different tune in the House today.  The Government is extremely clear about the fact that the resolution of both the economic difficulties in Europe and the problems which are giving rise to instability in respect of the euro will not be confined just to what is contained in the fiscal compact treaty.  There is also a need for a jobs and growth strategy and this was reflected in the conclusions relating to the January summit and in those brought forward following last week's European Council meeting.  As the Deputy is aware, the multi-annual framework for the European Union is currently under discussion.  The negotiations in this regard may, depending on progress, conclude by 2012.  If this does not prove to be the case, they may well fall to be concluded during the Irish Presidency at the beginning of 2013.  The approach being taken by the European Council in respect of the jobs and growth strategy will have implications for the European budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Deputy Ó Fearghaíl referred to what he terms the "initial design flaws" in respect of the euro.  The fiscal compact treaty addresses issues of governance relating to the euro and makes provision for the establishment of a eurozone presidency and for the holding of regular eurozone meetings.  The issues in this regard are being dealt with.  There are rules which govern any common currency and these must be complied with by states which are members of that currency.  Inevitably, issues arise as to what happens when there is a failure to comply with such rules.  This is one of the matters which the treaty addresses.  The ECB has already made a major commitment to the European economy by providing €430 billion prior to Christmas and €529 billion last week.  That is almost €1 billion in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The treaty does not contain any proposals in respect of measures relating to corporation or any other form of tax.  As everyone is aware, discussions are taking place on the CCCTB - in the aftermath of the publication of the Commission's paper - and on the financial transaction tax and these will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I agree that the crisis in Syria is an extremely serious matter.  Perhaps Deputy Ó Fearghaíl and I can engage in a longer discussion on this matter at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade later today.  However, I wish to state for the record that neither I nor the Government support the kind of approach advocated by US Senator John McCain because this would only serve to make the situation worse and would ensure the conflict in Syria degenerates into one of complete civil war.  We are seeking to address the crisis in Syria and I will comment on the matter at greater length at the joint committee's meeting.</p>

From where will it obtain the resources to finance such a bailout?</p>
          <p eId="para_444">In the context of the European sanctions against Iran, I understand that Finland - in the context of the non-proliferation treaty - will host a conference on ridding the Middle East of nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction later in the year.  What role can Ireland, which was the driving force behind the non-proliferation treaty, play in respect of bringing Israel, Iran and other states in the region together?  In light of our past history in respect of this matter, does the Tánaiste regret closing down our embassy in Tehran?</p>

          <p eId="para_445">I do not understand the logic of what the Tánaiste is saying or of what the statements emanating from the European Council appear to imply.  How is it possible to state that, on one hand, steps will be taken to tackle unemployment, promote growth, restore normal lending, etc., while seeking to pass a treaty which will ban borrowing, on the other?  The Tánaiste can correct me if I am wrong but the fiscal compact treaty effectively bans states from borrowing.  It might be reasonable to argue that we should not borrow for frivolous purposes or to finance ongoing expenditure.  It would be quite normal to borrow for capital and infrastructure projects, job creation or initiatives to promote growth.  If that is banned under the treaty to which we are signing up, how can we seriously hope to promote job creation?  Is there not a supreme irony in us being told that such borrowing will be banned in perpetuity but the same people arguing that we cannot borrow for those purposes are stating we must borrow to pay off bankers' gambling debts?</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Will the Tánaiste clarify comments from a Danish MEP at a meeting we had this week which concerned the treaty?  He suggested that the penalty rules and strictures of the fiscal treaty would not apply to all states equally.  He indicated that although Sweden, for example, has signed up to the treaty, there are agreements which mean the penalties and strictures for states stepping outside the criteria of the treaty will not apply to Sweden.  In other words, there is one law for some states and another for other states in the implementation of this treaty.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked what is plan B if the treaty is rejected.  Frankly, the onus is on the Deputy's party to tell us the answer if the treaty is rejected because he and his colleagues are advocating its rejection.  The Government is putting forward the treaty on a positive basis and we believe the treaty will contribute to stabilising the euro, which is in everybody's interest.  People understand why this is necessary with regard to the value of the euro in their pocket and stabilising the eurozone so we can get investment in jobs in Europe.  As soon as we move past ratification of the treaty we can consider how to grow the European economy, which consists of 500 million people.  There are significant positives and we must focus a bit more on them.  There are many apocalyptic stories being told but Europe has a very significant future.  There is potential for the European economy to grow with a market of 500 million people and all that is around it.  That is where we should put our focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Access to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, will be for those states that ratify the treaty.  As I noted before, the Government's intention is to exit the programme we are in so that we can get back to the financial markets.  The difficulty that an inability to access the ESM would have is in the entry back to the market.  If there is a perception that we do not have access to the safety net of the ESM, there may be consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">On the issue of Finland and the non-proliferation treaty, I have worked closely with my Finnish colleague and will continue to do so on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">With regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution, we are at the beginning of a referendum campaign and we should not start by making comments that are not true.  This treaty does not ban borrowing any more than the last treaty banned the holding of future referenda, which was one of the daft claims made at the time.  The treaty before us does not ban borrowing but provides for the implementation of the rules around the euro, which have been agreed already.  We must realise that treaty or no treaty, we should address the level of borrowing that this country has.  We cannot go on borrowing an additional €50 million every day to pay our way and we must tackle the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_458">The Government absolutely does not concede that, as Deputy Ross put it, there will almost inevitably be a second bailout.  We do not accept that at all.  The Government's strategy and objective is that we are in a programme and it will run for a period.  Our intention is to exit that programme and return to the markets.  All of the indications to date are that we will succeed in doing so.  We are meeting the targets of the programme and, as the Deputy knows, the National Treasury Management Agency did an exchange of 2014 bonds for 2015 bonds quite successfully.  We are confident we will exit the programme and get back to the markets.  I do not accept the Deputy's comments about an inevitability - as the Deputy termed it - of a second bailout.  I repeat that our strategy is to exit the programme and get back into the markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">A number of Departments have been involved in the negotiations on the promissory notes, including my own, and the process of the negotiations is being overseen by the economic management council of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Deputy Wallace asked about the possibility of an Israeli military strike on Iran.  When I met Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Lieberman, I communicated very directly Ireland's very strong opposition to any such military strike against Iran.  I have said publicly that any such approach would be disastrous both for peace in the region and world peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The Acting Chairman has asked me to wind up the debate so I thank Members who contributed to the discussion.  It is important that we locate what is happening in Europe, including the proposal for the fiscal treaty, as part of the strategy for economic recovery.  We have had debates on where responsibility lies for the economic mess in which we find ourselves.  What matters, however, is that we bring about economic recovery.  There are a number of elements to this, including stabilising the euro which is what the treaty is about, and creating jobs and growth in Europe, which is why the Government has insisted successfully on the second arm of the agenda being put in place.  In terms of what is happening in the banking system, the European economy generally and with the euro, the role of the ECB is important.  In that regard, the advances it has made in recent months are welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">It is important that we do not constantly talk ourselves into a depression.  We must look at where progress is being made because it is being made and the economy has returned to growth.  The national household survey figures published today show the number of those in employment, in the final quarter of 2011, increased for the first time since 2007.  I do not want to exaggerate this and say the low rate of growth achieved last year and the small increase in the number of people at work are the end of it.  Of course, they are not.  However, this shows we are making progress which we must continue.  Part and parcel of this is ensuring certainty and the stability of the euro.  That is why it is necessary for the treaty to be passed.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_303">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources  (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_464">The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, administers the low income housing retrofit programme, Better Energy: Warmer Homes, on behalf of my Department.  As I announced in the context of the budget, the Government has committed significant funding of €76.146 million to the wider better energy programme this year, of which €17.146 million is allocated to its Better Energy: Warmer Homes section.</p>
            <p eId="para_465">The 2012 allocation of €76.146 million for the overall better energy programme, including Better Energy: Homes, is an overall decrease of 19% year on year.  I was able to secure an additional €30 million from the jobs initiative last May.  This figure, combined with the 2011 budget allocation of €60 million and €6 million in savings, brought the 2011 total to €96 million.  This is a substantial allocation at a time of severe budgetary constraint and in the context of the overall reduction of €750 million which the Government had to make on capital expenditure in 2012.  The programme continues to underpin significant economic activity, supporting at least 4,500 jobs and realising significant energy savings for households.  The relative prioritisation accorded to the programme is a recognition of its economic, employment and environmental impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_466">Grant levels for half the measures under Better Energy: Homes have been adjusted for 2012 in light of market developments and to ensure a better link between grant support and dwelling type.  For instance, the reduction in the external wall insulation grant reflects increased price competitiveness in the market and the relative cost of undertaking this work on the various house types.</p>
            <p eId="para_467">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_468">Since the start of 2012, there has been a decrease in applications across all measures in Better Energy: Homes.  The factors behind this trend are unclear and I have asked my Department and the SEAI to report urgently to me in the matter.  For example, take-up of the external wall insulation measure has decreased by the least amount, despite the grant level for this activity being reduced by the highest amount.  Nevertheless, I would be concerned by any adverse employment impact resulting from the adjustments in grants, while accepting that the scheme must be operated within the allocated budget in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_469">It is difficult to assess the extent, if any, of job cuts on Better Energy: Warmer Homes as it has a smaller allocation than Better Energy: Homes and is primarily delivered by community-based organisations, of which 26 typically operate back-to-work schemes.  In locations where no community based organisation is active, the SEAI ensures measures are delivered by private contractors who are appointed on the basis of a competitive tendering process.  In this regard, an invitation to tender was recently published by the SEAI in the <i>EU Journal</i> to establish a new panel of contractors to augment the community-based organisation network.  The procurement process will take a number of weeks to conclude and a panel should be in place in May.</p>
            <p eId="para_470">This year will see a shift in focus in the Better Energy: Warmer Homes scheme to take account of the publication of the affordable energy strategy and the involvement of energy suppliers in meeting their energy savings targets agreed as part of their voluntary agreements with the SEAI.  This new approach will see greater focus placed on introducing an area-based approach to low income housing retrofits.  This will result in more opportunities for both community-based organisations and private contractors.</p>

            <p eId="para_471">We all agree the scheme has been successful in terms of energy efficiency, securing savings in energy bills and reducing our carbon footprint.  This is important in respect of climate change, which is another agenda on which we must focus.  Will the Minister nail down the up-to-date position regarding the 2,000 additional jobs mooted as part of the jobs initiative?  Is the sum of €30 million provided under the jobs initiative a once-off contribution to the better energy programme?  Were the 2,000 jobs realised and, if not, how many jobs have been created under the scheme?  Was the Minister warned, prior to the budget, of potential job losses if the budget for the scheme was reduced?  Was this matter discussed?</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_472">The outturn figures for last year show that between 5,750 and 5,900 jobs were supported by the scheme.  In other words, the 2,000 jobs promised under the jobs initiative materialised.  Incidentally, I do not know if I should congratulate the Deputy or commiserate with him.  Either way, my intentions are good.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy indicates in the question, the allocation to the Better Energy: Homes scheme has been reduced owing to the overall reduction imposed on the Government by the memorandum of understanding.  However, the allocation still compares favourably with the figure from the 2011 budget.  While the latter provided €60 million for the scheme, the 2012 budget provides €76 million for the scheme.  As Deputy Collins noted, I was able to secure an additional €30 million from the jobs initiative last year, and this boosted employment.  It is our expectation that the scheme will support approximately 4,500 jobs this year.  Whether this figure will be exceeded, I cannot say at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_473">Information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act indicates the Department was warned by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland that a budget of €71 million would sustain 4,000 jobs.  It is critical to nail down the precise number of jobs that will be supported under a specific measure.  The Minister indicated the total amount allocated to the scheme in 2011 was €96 million.  Does this figure include money that was carried forward?</p>

            <p eId="para_474">As to the advice given by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which administers the scheme, its assessment of the €76.146 million is that it will create or sustain 4,500 jobs.  That is the SEAI's advice as of today.  Almost all of the budget for 2011 has been spent.  The uptake, which was high in 2011, has decreased in the first two months of 2012.  I have asked the SEAI to give me an analysis of this decline.  Prices in the marketplace are more competitive and the scheme has been finessed as it has progressed.  The idea was to kick-start awareness of the merits of energy efficiency, for all of the reasons Deputy Collins cited.  However, whether as a result of the finessing of the grant levels, the exceptionally mild winter or some other reason, the figures are down, as the Deputy noted.  I am not sure one can make a judgment on the basis of two months and I have asked the SEAI to report to me on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_476">2<b>Deputy Martin Ferris</b> asked the <b>Minister for Communications; Energy and Natural Resources</b> the position regarding the proposed LNG project. [13109/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_309" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_477">As Deputy Ferris knows, I have consistently welcomed the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct a liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal near Ballylongford, County Kerry.  Such a facility, together with the bringing onshore of Corrib gas would provide important security of gas supply for Ireland.  I met the promoters of the project soon after taking office last year and both my Department and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, are in regular contact with Shannon LNG.  The House will be aware from my replies to previous parliamentary questions of the meeting last December between the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Deenihan, Deputy Spring and myself and company representatives from Shannon LNG and of the general discussion at that meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_478">The Commission for Energy Regulation has been engaged in an extensive consultation process on the matter over some time and has had considerable interaction with Shannon LNG and other stakeholders.  Decisions on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors and tariffing are statutorily a matter for the CER under the enactment of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  The CER, as the independent energy regulator, is statutorily charged with a duty to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness.  The regulator has a duty to ensure new sources of gas for the Irish market do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business or domestic consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">I fully acknowledge the complexity of the decision which the regulator must make and the need for various difficult balances to be struck.  Together with all players and potential players in Ireland's gas market, Shannon LNG has a key commercial interest in the outcome of the regulator's ultimate decision on this complex regulatory question.  Given the complexities, there are many different perspectives on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_480">On 1 March the Commission for Energy Regulation held a further public forum for stakeholders.  This followed publication on 17 February of its proposed decision paper on the issue of the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors.  Stakeholders have a further opportunity to respond to the regulator by 16 March on the matters raised in the proposed decision paper.  At the end of this period, the CER will assess all comments received and publish a final decision.  I understand the regulator has indicated a decision will be made by the end of April.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_481">As the Minister will be aware, this issue has been ongoing for more than 18 months.  I do not know how many times I have tabled it as a Topical Issue Debate matter or raised it on the Order of Business.  This is the second time I have raised it with him at Priority Question Time.  He is also well aware of expectations in north Kerry which has been devastated by unemployment.  The value of the project going ahead cannot be overstated.  Communication seems to be a problem, which I cannot understand, given that on 21 December the Taoiseach said he would set up a meeting between Shannon LNG, the regulator and the Department.  If we cannot get all of the stakeholders around the table, this issue will not be resolved.</p>

            <p eId="para_483">I attended a meeting last Thursday morning which included a briefing session that involved the regulator.  In answer to a question from the floor from one of the groups supporting the Shannon LNG project about who was responsible for policy, the regulator said he was.  I assume policy is determined by elected representatives, not the regulator.  Is it possible in the short term to facilitate a meeting between all of the stakeholders in order that this issue can be resolved to everybody's satisfaction?</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_484">I share the Deputy's view of the desirability of proceeding with a significant employment project in an area such as Ballylongford.  I have, in so far as it is within my power, done everything to indicate why the Government wants to support and progress the project as quickly as it can.  However, as I stated previously, we would have had a decision last October from the regulator whose task this is under statute if the promoters of the project had not decided for whatever reason to have recourse to the European Union.  That has delayed the process.  The consultation with stakeholders the Deputy has sought is under way as a result of the meeting held on 21 December to which he referred.  All of the stakeholders were convened by the CER and invited to make submissions.  They were further invited to make written or oral submissions before 16 March on the draft decision paper published.  The regulator has promised to have a final decision by the end of April.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_485">I still cannot understand why a person with the Minister's authority cannot convene a meeting of all the stakeholders around the table which is the only way he will resolve this issue.  Making submissions is a delaying tactic that will push out the boat all the time.  It is within the Minister's remit to convene such a meeting.  If it happened, it would clear the muddy waters and people would be clearer.  Will he pull the stakeholders together and initiate a meeting between the CER, the Department and Shannon LNG to resolve the issue?</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_486">I again draw the Deputy's attention to the statutory function and role of the regulator.  On 1 March he convened a meeting of the stakeholders and everybody was invited to make a presentation.  I refer to the article in today's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on this issue which deals with some of the complexities and pitfalls for the consumer and the national interest.  It is being bruited in Kerry by the promoters that I can give a policy direction on the matter to the regulator.  I want to make it clear that I can give a general policy direction, but I cannot intervene on behalf of, or in opposition to, a particular project.</p>

            <p eId="para_491">3<b>Deputy Catherine Murphy</b> asked the <b>Minister for Communications; Energy and Natural Resources</b> if he will elaborate on potential future changes to the public service broadcasting licence fee structure, particularly with reference to the introduction of a broadcasting charge; if he will make known figures relating to the use of online services which would fall under the definition of public service; if he will outline the way such figures might verifiably be used as part of any new funding system for the delivery of public service broadcasting, if possible; if he is considering differential rates in the new charge for domestic householders and commercial businesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_320" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_492">The programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the television licence fee in the light of existing and projected convergence of technologies and transforming the television licence into a household-based public broadcasting charge to be applied to all eligible households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device used to access content.  In line with this commitment, my Department is examining both the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing model of television licence fee collection in the context of the changing technological environment.  It is also examining the applicability to the situation in Ireland of various international models for the funding of public service broadcasting.</p>
            <p eId="para_493">Although subject to evasion, the existing television licence fee system has provided a stable funding base for public service broadcasters.  The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects, while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">The overall aim of public service broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Through the obligations placed on public service broadcasters and the criteria set for the funding of content through the sound and vision scheme, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interests can be assured.  Whatever the system of funding, the rationale for providing funding will continue to apply and any changes that may be implemented on foot of the review must continue to provide a secure funding base for public service broadcasting and content, while also recognising the reality of new mechanisms to access such content and its pervasiveness in today's society.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">The principle underlying the proposal for the introduction of a public broadcasting charge on eligible households and applicable businesses is that publicly funded public service broadcasting is a public good and, as such, of benefit to society in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_497">Publicly funded public service broadcasting services and content are now available to everyone on an ever-increasing range of platforms and devices - radio, television, smartphone, personal computer, laptop and many other devices - and access is not dependent on ownership of a device.  In short, everyone benefits from the availability of these services, regardless of how content is accessed or relayed to the public.  Therefore, the cost should be borne by society as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_498">The replacement of the existing funding system based on the collection of television licence fees with one based on the imposition of a device-independent charge on eligible households and businesses is a complex process and much of the detail has yet to be worked out.  In this regard, I can confirm that my Department is in the initial stages of developing proposals to engage independent consultants to assist in progressing this work in the coming year.  At this point, however, as the charge will be device independent, the issue raised by the Deputy regarding the use of data relating to online services is of no particular relevance to the funding system or the manner in which charges might be applied.  The charge will replace the current licence fee and all households and businesses will be subject to the charge, except for those specifically exempted.   I can confirm that the question of differentiation between the charges to be imposed on households and businesses will be one of the issues to be considered by my Department as part of this process.  However, the details of the precise approach have yet to be determined.</p>
            <p eId="para_499">On the issue of exemptions under any new system put in place, this will have to be given detailed consideration when the type of model to be developed is agreed.  That said, it is my expectation that the current exemptions relating to pensioners and those entitled to the household benefits package will continue to apply.</p>

            <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_500">The programme for Government includes what the Minister has outlined.  When is he likely to introduce enabling legislation?  Is it likely to be this year?  I refer to the scale of implementation of the charge.  For example, people renew their television licences on a rolling basis.  If a new charge were applied, would that be on an annualised basis?</p>
            <p eId="para_501">I spoke on another occasion of consulting with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about the use of a database.  Is that the same database as the one used for the household charge?  Section 14 of the relevant legislation allowed for the use of the database, or there was some discussion about the protocols with regard to the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_502">On previous occasions the Minister said the charge for the television licence might end up being less than it is at the moment.  If that is the case, somebody else is coming into the mix.  I understand people are viewing on different platforms and so on.  Most companies, for example, will have a computer, but will not necessarily watch television.  The charge the Minister is considering appears to capture businesses also.  Will there be a differential in the charge for businesses and households, or does he envisage a single charge?</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_503">I do not envisage that any decision will be finalised this year, for a number of reasons.  High among these is the objective of successfully managing the transition from analogue to digital television services by RTE.  That is a big project, and RTE has put something like €70 million into building the system and general preparation.  The termination of analogue signals across Europe and the move to digital terrestrial television is high on the list of priorities, and I do not see that being interfered with this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">Deputy Murphy wanted to know whether the television licence charge would be lower.  This is a dangerous business.  I answered a question about whether it could be less by saying it could, but I did not say it would.  We have not reached that stage yet.  What I did say was that any public service broadcast charge will be a replacement of the existing television licence.  This is not an additional charge or tax or levy.  If we improve the efficacy of the collection system to avoid the loss of up to €30 million, one never knows.  I might well surprise Deputy Murphy, as the amount conceivably could be less.</p>
            <p eId="para_505">With regard to the distinction between business and domestic viewers, there are many anomalies in the existing system, one of which is the fact that only one television licence is needed for a 500-bed hotel, but if one has three cottages occupied for two months a year on the west coast - or a caravan, if that is one's choice - one must have a television licence for each of them.  There are issues such as this that need to be ironed out to be fair to consumers.</p>

            <p eId="para_508">The Deputy is right; unfortunately, advertising is limited, and I regret to say there is no particular sign at the moment that it is increasing.  There is competition, also, from online advertising for a share of the traditional advertising market.  That is a problem for the industry.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that it will be an extensive, root-and-branch review because of the phenomenal and accelerating developments in the broadcasting sector.  Viewers no longer rely on accessing public service content on traditional televisions.  They may now access it through a number of different devices, and they do access public service content, although they may be reluctant to admit it.  It does require an extensive review.  The Deputy mentioned competition outside the jurisdiction.  Obviously, there is online competition, but we must also compete with high-quality public service broadcasters in the neighbouring island.  We will examine the overall situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_509">4<b>Deputy Niall Collins</b> asked the <b>Minister for Communications; Energy and Natural Resources</b> if he completed an impact analysis of potential job losses on ESB or Bord Gais when they are part privatised; if he will publish same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_510">The Government has decided that Bord Gáis Éireann's energy business and some of the ESB's non-strategic power generation capacity will be part of the assets disposal programme required by the memorandum of understanding.  The Government has also reiterated its commitment to retaining the ESB as a vertically integrated utility in State ownership and to retaining the electricity and gas networks, as well as the two gas interconnectors and the east-west electricity interconnector, in State ownership.  I do not envisage job losses in ESB or BGE as an inevitable outcome of the planned disposals.  The proposed sales can deliver positive outcomes for Ireland's energy markets, for the two State utilities and their employees, for consumers and for business.  The ESB will remain a strong strategic player, positioned more competitively in the all-island energy market and in due course in the integrated European market.  BGE is a dynamic and successful company which has delivered real benefits for consumers as it has invested in and increased its power generation and energy supply.  The sale of BGE's energy business will support this vibrant company and its employees in continuing to grow while enhancing competition in the energy market for the benefit of the economy and consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_511">The asset disposal programme will be implemented in an orderly process over time in a way that allows all policy regulatory and financial issues to be addressed in advance and that ensures full value for the State.  It is important to emphasise that the Government has agreed with the troika that a proportion of the proceeds of the State assets programme can be used for reinvestment in support of employment and economic recovery.</p>

            <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_512">Will the Minister let us know directly whether there has been an impact analysis?  Most commentators have the opinion that full or part-privatisation effectively means potential job losses, because private investors seek a return on their investment.  That must be planned for and factored into the strategy that the Government undertakes as part of this programme.  We also need to debate further in this Chamber the fuller definition of strategic, as opposed to non-strategic, State assets.  I will give the Minister an example which is not under his area of responsibility.  Deputy Ferris and I are of the view that the Shannon-Heathrow landing slots under the stewardship of Aer Lingus are a strategic State asset for regional development in our part of the country, yet the Government seems to have taken a view that they are a non-strategic State asset.</p>
            <p eId="para_513">In pursuing an agenda, it is not a matter of left-wing or right-wing policy; what is important is whether it is the right thing to do, socially and financially, for the country, bearing in mind the employees involved.  Has the Minister carried out an impact analysis?  If he has, can he publish it?</p>
            <p eId="para_514">There are deficits in the pension funds of the aforementioned companies.  How does the Minister propose to deal with this prior to embarking on this course of action?  The deficits are significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_515">If the Minister tries to sell these assets in a climate in which these deficits persist, he will secure a potentially depressed sale price or face an industrial relations issue as part of the sales process.  I ask him to respond to these two specific items - the analysis of the impact on jobs and the pensions deficit.</p>

            <p eId="para_516">I have not made any analysis of the impact on jobs and in advance of decisions being made I am not sure how one would do so.  I have talked to management in the ESB and Bord Gáis and I am happy as a result of those discussions that part-privatisation of, say, Bord Gáis down the line, far from being likely to lead to job reductions, could lead to additional employment as additional investment by a private sector partner helped to grow the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">The second matter raised by the Deputy - the pensions issue - is separate to be considered down the line in the two companies to which he referred.  I am glad that the ESB has managed to get the support of its group of unions to refurbish the pensions scheme and done so imaginatively and creatively.  Bord Gáis is well on the way to doing the same.  These are immensely successful companies and there is no intention, as I have said time and again, of disposing of any part of them in inferior market conditions or in the current market environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_519">I have received two reports on the safety aspects of Bord Gáis's award of a contract to the Balfour Beatty-CLG joint venture.  As I have no direct role or responsibility in a tender process or contract award by a commercial semi-State company, the focus of my scrutiny in this instance is to ensure both BGE and the Commission for Energy Regulation have carried out their duties appropriately and effectively and that their respective assessment processes have been robust.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">I have received a report from Bord Gáis whose management and board have a legal and fiduciary responsibility to ensure compliance with both procurement and safety requirements.  I have also received a report from the regulator which has the statutory responsibility of regulating the activities of natural gas undertakings with respect to safety.  The Bord Gáis report advises that the safety incidents previously highlighted by the Deputy, some of which date back ten to 15 years, should be seen in the context of the scale of the Balfour Beatty Group which employs over 270,000 people and has 163 subsidiary companies.  The report provides safety statistics for Balfour Beatty Utility Solutions and CLG Developments Limited which are the partner companies in the joint venture.  Bord Gáis considers that these compare favourably to UK and Irish construction industry statistics.  The report advises that following a rigorous assessment process, Bord Gáis is satisfied that the Balfour Beatty-CLG joint venture is fully qualified to undertake its obligations to the high safety standards demanded by Bord Gáis Networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_521">The regulator's report advises that, following a detailed evaluation of the change to the Bord Gáis safety case on foot of the new network services and works contract, the regulator has accepted the change and that a further verification process is in place, including audits and inspections by the regulator, to ensure the change is managed effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">My officials are assessing both reports together, with additional clarifications subsequently received, and will forward their own assessment to me shortly.  In the interim and as I have no direct responsibility in the award of the contract in this instance, I have asked Bord Gáis to write directly to the Deputy on the issues he has raised.</p>

The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, asked that I do the same and I also forwarded it to him and the regulator.  I am not certain that enough attention has been given to the safety aspect of the matter.  The Minister has mentioned that the issues I have raised date back ten years; some of them do, but I refer, in particular, to issues which arose in 2008 and 2009.  In 2008 Balfour Beatty was fined £2.25 million sterling after it had been charged by the British Serious Fraud Squad and found guilty of false accounting.  In 2009 it was fined £5.2 million sterling by the Office of Fair Trading for engaging in corrupt practices in securing construction contracts.</p>

            <p eId="para_526">We are talking about the serious issue of safety in the gas system.  I have set out for the House the statutory responsibilities in that regard.  I take the allegations made by the Deputy very seriously and acted on them after he had brought them to my attention when I last answered questions at Question Time.  I have since received the two reports to which I referred, one from Bord Gáis and the other from the regulator whom I am not in a position to second guess.  I have indicated why the regulator is satisfied that the company, despite the blemishes on its record, to which the Deputy referred, is competent, qualified and has a track record to deal with the functions allocated to it in this contract.  It is a company which has 270,000 employees and 163 subsidiary companies.  It operates and provides these services across Europe.  That is the advice available to me and I have no reason to second guess the regulator in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_527">I refer to the criminal conviction guidelines of the Department of Finance which provide that if somebody has been convicted of fraud, that person is precluded from participating in a public contract.  It is clear that Balfour Beatty was fined £2.25 million sterling in 2008 after it had been charged by the British Serious Fraud Squad and found guilty of false accounting, yet it has now been awarded this contract.  I understand all of this is the subject of a court case that is pending, but the guidelines of the Department of Finance do not allow a company with a fraud conviction to be awarded a public contract.  Therefore, the awarding of the contract contradicts the guidelines.  The Minister referred to safety and the number of employees in this group, but it has these convictions against it.  There are convictions dating back ten or 12 years, but these were made in 2008 and 2009.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to investigate the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_532">All post-primary schools will have a 100 MB broadband connection installed by the end of 2014 in a project jointly funded by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Education and Skills.  This follows on from the successful pilot project which has been running in some second level schools for the past two years.  The national roll-out will be completed on an incremental basis, with 200 schools being connected by October 2012, a further 200 being connected in 2013 and the remaining 250 schools being connected in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_533">This investment is tangible evidence of the Government's commitment to the integration of ICT in teaching and learning, and to our support for a new digital economy.  The availability of high quality broadband connectivity will allow schools to fully integrate ICT as a key teaching resource for all subjects.  In so doing, we will enhance the traditional learning experience as well as providing basic building blocks for a 21st century digital workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_534">It is expected that the first 200 second level schools in the national roll-out will be connected by September 2012, although some of them will not be connected until October, depending on the arrangements.  These include all second level schools in counties Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath.  Working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, I look forward to the full roll-out of this programme over the next three years.</p>

            <p eId="para_538">To be honest, I have not got that far yet.  The reason I selected the 12 counties mentioned is because broadband is weakest in most of them.  They have basic broadband, but they do not have high speed broadband.  I visited a school in Claremorris, with which I have some familiarity, where the first year students have been using tablets since the beginning of the academic year, but due to the weakness of broadband provision, they will not be able to continue that as they move through the school.  The fantastic opportunities created by the availability of industrial strength broadband in second level schools mean that 50 classrooms can operate at the same time and the quality of teaching and learning is enhanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_539">The truthful answer to Deputy Collins's question is that I have not decided for 2013.  The criteria for this year related to where broadband provision was weakest.  I would like to see the belt of west Dublin being included next year, but if Deputy Collins is making a plea for west Limerick, I will have a look at that as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_545">The two questions are connected.  I had a considerable battle to get the money to roll out high-speed broadband across the second level schools.  The capital cost is being borne by my Department.  We are also bearing the current cost in the year of installation and for a year thereafter.  I certainly do not have the resources to perform a similar role for the primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_546">Deputy Lawlor and I might have an interesting discussion at another time about whether this facility is as badly needed in primary schools as it is in second level schools.  In any event, his question is connected to that raised by Deputy Murphy about the general quality and availability of broadband throughout the country.  We have had the last meeting of the task force, which I have chaired, between representatives of telecommunications companies and the relevant senior people in my Department.  The purpose of that report is to address Ireland's competence in next generation access.  As a result of that report, I will be required to bring a plan before the Government that devises a roadmap for the future in this critical area, highlighting where there is robust competition and adequate, acceptable high quality connectivity, and where there is not.  I hope to pick up some of the concerns of both Deputies in that context.</p>

Durkan</b> asked the <b>Minister for Communications; Energy and Natural Resources</b> the extent to which energy prices here compare favourably with those other EU jurisdictions within the Eurozone and without, the extent to which opinion has been sought to identify the reasons for any disparities; if he can through the aegis of the Regulator put in place any measures to address identifiable factors affecting possible gas, petrol, diesel and heating oil in view of the necessity to achieve competitiveness and eliminate possible speculation on world markets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_548">The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated, and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control on petroleum products and it is government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is an independent statutory body.</p>
            <p eId="para_549">Previous surveys have shown that prices charged by Irish retailers for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  Prices at the pump reflect the volatile market price, as well as transportation costs, trends in euro-dollar exchange rates and other operating costs, together with the impact of taxation on oil products.</p>
            <p eId="para_550">Figures produced by the EU market observatory for energy in its oil bulletin, in respect of prices in force on 20 February 2012, indicate that the price in Ireland of petrol and diesel - I think this is the point being raised by the Deputy - was lower than the EU average, and that the price of home heating gas oil was higher than the EU average.  Such prices were inclusive of duties and taxes.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">Ireland's electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by increasing competition, regulated by the CER.  Competition puts downward pressure on prices, while we must acknowledge that global fossil fuel prices are a factor outside Ireland's control.  Prices in the retail electricity market are now fully deregulated.  Since 1 October 2012, the residential gas consumer segment is the only segment of the electricity and gas markets where prices are regulated.  Prices in the electricity market and the unregulated part of the gas market are wholly commercial and are set by the suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_552">While Ireland is a price taker for imported fossil fuels, we will continue to focus on any additional actions to mitigate costs, where possible, for business and domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, employment and economic recovery.  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure the costs of energy for businesses are as competitive as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_553">Latest EUROSTAT data, published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for the first six months of 2011, show that Irish electricity and gas prices are competitive by reference to the EU average for medium to large business customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_554">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Does any evidence exist of commodity speculation in the marketplace which might have a negative impact or assert upward pressure on energy prices in this country, given that we are importers?  Can any special effort be made through the regulator to ensure there is every possible opportunity to reduce the price of oil, oil products and energy in this country in order to enable us avail of every opportunity to move towards economic recovery?</p>

            <p eId="para_555">Deputy Durkan is probably correct that one can never rule out speculation in the oil market as a factor.  The problem is that, ultimately, we are price takers.  Until we find oil off our own coast, which many seem determined we will not, we will import it.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">The latest figures from data published by EUROSTAT show that Irish electricity and gas prices are performing well by reference to the EU average for medium to large-size business customers.  That is not to say they compare with the best, but they compare favourably with the average.  The VAT-exclusive electricity price in Ireland for these business consumers ranged from 10% to 17% below the EU average and from 13% to 19% below the eurozone average.  These customers accounted for 48% of the business electricity market.  Prices for gas customers were below the EU average by 4% to 25% for most business gas categories.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">Larger domestic electricity consumers, representing 64% of the domestic electricity market experienced price reductions between 6.1% to 7.6% over the period.  The prices for these consumers were between 7% and 19% below the EU average.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_352" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_559">The State-owned independent transmission system operator, EirGrid, is building the east-west interconnector between Ireland and Britain.  The interconnector, which is on schedule and within budget, will be commissioned this autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_560">The interconnector is a strategically vital energy project for the island of Ireland and is financially supported under the European Energy Programme for Recovery.  It will critically contribute to national security of energy supply and competition as well as underpinning the progressive development of renewable energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">I have no role in the planning and construction of the transmission network, including the interconnector, which are operational matters for EirGrid.  The planning process is a matter for An Bord Pleanála under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">EirGrid obtained full planning permission for the east-west interconnector from An Bord Pleanála in 2009.  This approval followed a comprehensive assessment process including an oral hearing at which all stakeholders were present.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">During the planning process, including the oral hearing, public health and safety considerations were fully covered.  In that context, I want to place on record once again that I have no reason whatsoever to believe that any relevant data on EMF or any other health and safety dimension of the interconnector was withheld from, or misrepresented to, the planning process.  I am categorically assured by EirGrid that this is not the case and I would expect no less an assurance from the State-owned transmission company.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">I am aware that in 2010, after the decision by An Bord Pleanála, members of Rush Community Council raised further concerns about the health and safety implications of the interconnector project.  These matters have been comprehensively dealt with in the planning process.  However, in order to assist local community understanding and confidence, my Department commissioned an additional independent expert opinion on health issues relating to high voltage direct current cable technology.  The expert opinion was provided by Dr. Eric van Rongen, a leading international expert on EMF.  Dr. van Rongen's report has been in the public domain since October 2010 together with an additional report on the operational safety of the interconnector undertaken by the international energy consultants KEMA, published in June 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_565">The two additional reports reinforce the conclusions inherent in the decision of An Bord Pleanála that Ireland's east-west interconnector project fully meets all relevant international health and safety standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_566">I stated last year that it was time to bring closure to the ongoing debate on these matters, and I say it again today.  I have full confidence in EirGrid's commitment to complete the east-west interconnector successfully to the highest safety standards in the national interest and without risk to the health and safety of local communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_567">It was a specific question to which the part the Minister addressed was where he stated he had no reason to believe that any information was withheld or that An Bord Pleanála was misled.  That is a factually inaccurate statement because the Minister has evidence to the contrary.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">There was the meeting the Minister held with Rush Community Council where it was reported, and EirGrid itself has admitted, that the company did not submit information on time-varying magnetic fields as part of the An Bord Pleanála hearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_569">Professor Anthony Staines, co-author of the Government's report on the health effect of electromagnetic fields, has stated that it now appears that the evidence as to the induced magnetic field presented at the oral hearing was seriously inaccurate and, therefore, a potential adverse health affect of the cable system has not been assessed for the received planning permission and has not informed the route selection process.  This former Government adviser went on to state that this causes serious public concern and was serious misrepresentation to the planning hearing and that, in his opinion, a new planning permission is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">Based on information that the Minister had previously and information that I have resubmitted here today, that a former public health adviser to the Government has stated that the evidence submitted by EirGrid was flawed, what does Deputy Rabbitte propose to do about it?</p>

            <p eId="para_572">Deputy Daly is correct in one regard, that is, that I met Rush Community Council and as a result of that meeting, I re-tested the claims it makes that EirGrid withheld or misrepresented data on EMF during the planning process.

            <p eId="para_573">I repeat the Minister is incorrect.  EirGrid stated publicly to the planning authority that the magnetic field would only be static.  The company now admits that it has a time-varying component.  EirGrid has not denied that.  The company stated that such is the case but that the impact of it is insignificant.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">The Minister is inaccurate.  I ask him to go back and look at his notes.  There are serious health concerns which have been highlighted by Dr. Anthony Staines.  These include the risk of childhood leukemia, which Dr. Staines states has not been taken into account in these studies.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">As a public body, EirGrid is accountable to the Minister.  He can call the company in, look at this evidence again and seek EirGrid to go through a proper planning process where this information is brought in to the public domain.  I insist that the Minister would do that.</p>

The International Energy Agency, IEA, is completing its periodic in-depth review of Irish energy policy.  The agency reviews the energy policy of every member country every four to five years.  On this occasion, at my request, its review has included an assessment of the efficiency of the Irish electricity and gas sectors, as required under the troika memorandum.  The review commenced in September 2011 in line with the memorandum of understanding requirement.  My Department received an advance confidential copy of the assessment in January.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">The in-depth review of all aspects of Ireland's energy policy is being completed by the IEA and will encompass the independent assessment of the efficiency of the electricity and gas sectors.  The IEA advises that the date of publication of the review is mid-year.</p>

The memorandum of understanding requirement in this regard states actions to further enhance the regulatory and market reform programme will be taken in consultation with European Commission services.  The aim is to increase efficiency, improve governance, strengthen competition and improve the energy sector's ability to contribute towards addressing Ireland's financing needs and enhancing growth potential and economic recovery.  Compliance with all relevant EU energy legislation, notably the third internal energy package, is a key part of the ongoing work.</p>

            <p eId="para_588">In October last year I requested the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct research and advise me on the environmental implications of hydraulic fracturing as a means of extracting natural gas from underground reserves.  The agency is funding preliminary background research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction and the regulatory approaches of other countries, with a view to helping to establish best environmental practice.  This research is in the form of a desk-based study being carried out by the University of Aberdeen.</p>
            <p eId="para_589">The EPA proposes to commission further, more extensive, research on hydraulic fracturing in 2012.  A working group involving representatives of my Department and the EPA has been established to develop the scope of this study.  However, the final specification for this research will only be prepared after the EPA, an independent statutory body, has considered the output from the study under way at the University of Aberdeen.  I understand the EPA expects to receive the report on that study in the coming weeks and expect it will make the final results of the study accessible to me as soon as they are available.  Although my hair is grey with the subject, I have no plans to publish either a Green or White Paper at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_590">Will the Minister explain why he has no intention of publishing a policy discussion paper on the subject?  It is fair to say there are environmental concerns, but there are also human, social and community concerns, of which we have seen evidence in documentaries on the issue.  For example, we know that fracking has been banned in France.  A number of preliminary licences are at issue.  Does the Minister not consider it would be preferable to have a national policy, rather than having hit and miss policies across local authorities?  Why would we not opt for a broader national policy at this time?</p>

            <p eId="para_591">We should opt for a broader national policy and I absolutely agree that is the right approach.  However, I simply do not have the expert evidence available to me at this stage.  A little over one year ago the previous Government issued licences for exploration to three companies, but essentially they were for no more than desktop-style surveying.  I await the report of the EPA which I requested.  It has advised me that this is not a simple overnight matter.  Its opposite number in the United States has been examining this subject for the best part of three years and its report is due this year.  This is also a major issue in the United States and it has had a dramatic impact on the price of gas which has fallen dramatically.  However, it has not been without allegations in some states.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">I have met groups here which are concerned about the issue and taken on board what they said.  I commissioned the EPA to carry out a study as a result and I am making further money available to it, but we cannot design the project until I receive the findings of the University of Aberdeen study.  In the interim, I know there are public meetings taking place in various places and that people concerned about this issue have been to Leinster House to make presentations; at least one of the companies involved has been heard here.  All of this adds to the debate, but we are a long way from being able to a have an evidence-based national policy on fracking.</p>

Have there been consultations with the EPA's counterpart in the Six Counties, given that the fracking project will straddle the Border?  Have there been consultations with the EPA's equivalent in France on the reasoning behind the ban imposed on fracking by the French Government?  Is there concurrent evidence in this country to suggest the same?</p>

            <p eId="para_594">Yes, I have had discussions with our colleagues in Northern Ireland about this because they seem to be further along the road than we are, and were about to commence fracking in Fermanagh in particular.  They too now are pulling back somewhat and waiting until more information is available in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_595">No, I have not spoken to the French EPA, but we have spoken to some people politically in France.  I understand the decision to ban is not an absolute one; it is a decision to ban until more evidence is compiled.  They may well continue the ban then but I do not know.  The ban is sometimes explained as conclusive evidence on the subject, but as I understand it from political sources, it is a ban pending research.  Everybody across the European Union, bar one member state that is well disposed towards it, is anxious to get evidence to allay the fears of citizens about the issue and at the same time trying to balance that with the possibility of safely extracting such gas as it would have a considerable economic impact on whatever country made such finds.</p>

            <p eId="para_597">The Government has decided that Bord Gáis Éireann's energy business and some of the ESB's non-strategic power generation capacity will be part of the State assets disposal programme.  The Government is irrevocably committed to retaining the Bord Gáis transmission and distribution networks as well as the gas interconnectors in State ownership as national strategic infrastructure and fundamental to Ireland's security of energy supply and the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">The Government has also reiterated its commitment to retaining the electricity networks in State ownership and to retaining the ESB as a vertically integrated utility in State ownership as a strong strategic player in the all-island energy market and in due course in the integrated European market.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">Both the ESB and Bord Gáis recorded a net profit in their most recently published financial statements.  I assume that in referring to the deficits of the ESB and Bord Gáis the Deputy has in mind the deficits in the pension funds of those companies.  I note the boards of management and employees of both the ESB and Bord Gáis have already agreed and are implementing measures to address the deficits in their respective pension funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">In the context of the asset disposal programme, my Department, in co-operation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and with the assistance of NewERA, is currently undertaking the necessary analysis to identify the policy, regulatory, legislative and financial issues that may need to be addressed prior to any disposal.  Consideration of any identified potential pension issues as a result of this analysis will form part of the further detailed due diligence work required prior to any divestments.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">I would emphasise that a guiding principle of the assets programme is ensuring that the best possible value is derived for the State, not least given that part of the proceeds can be used for re-investment to support employment and economic recovery.

            <p eId="para_602">We aired some of the issues relating to the question earlier on the policy of Government on privatisation or part-privatisation of State assets.  It is important that the Government would pursue an agenda to provide for the creation of a register of lobbyists prior to any privatisation of State assets in the interests of transparency and accountability.  We know the high-profile household names, former politicians for example from the Minister's party, the Fine Gael Party and my party, who now engage in the business of lobbying.  They are above the radar but there is an army of people engaged in the lobby industry who are not household names who operate below the radar and who will potentially play a major part in lobbying and seeking to influence Government policy in this regard.  It is incumbent on the Government to establish a register of lobbyists prior to going any further down the route of privatisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_603">I agree with Deputy Collins that we traced the issue of the pensions previously.  We can be proud of the progress made in the two companies concerned on the pension issue because pensions generally have been affected right across the economy, defined benefit pension schemes in particular.  The agreements entered into are landmark agreements that might well be replicated elsewhere.  That is very positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">As regards the regulation of lobbyists, I agree with Deputy Collins that it is desirable.  It is the nature of modern politics imported from the United States that one could get knocked down at the gate by lobbyists coming at one on behalf of their clients for access in various ways.  I do not have any particular objection to companies using PR people to make such representations so long as - as Deputy Collins said - it is transparent.  In many cases I do not understand why the companies themselves do not do the task rather than employ people to do it on their behalf, but that is a matter entirely for them.</p>

His Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, could examine the possibility of long-term leases for wind farm developers.  The State would have none of the risk.  Much of the land owned by Coillte is in areas where we have wind speeds that are suitable for wind farms.  We could still maintain some of the asset that is the forestry.  It would allow the State to access some of the value of the lands without risk.</p>

            <p eId="para_606">I acknowledge that the Deputy has a point that desires being entertained because we must continue to build up our renewable capacity.  We cannot have windmills at every crossroads in the country.  It is desirable that wind farms ought to be clustered.  The availability of land is most apparent in the case of some State companies, Coillte and Bord na Móna in particular, and we must have regard to that in any decision that is implemented in respect of the agreement with the troika.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">I have had some discussions on the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney.  In any event, I hope it is understood that the State does not propose to sell Coillte.  As the proposal currently stands the intention is to examine the sale of the harvesting of the timber but not to sell the land.  Deputy Mulherin has made an important point in terms of our capacity to carve out provision for the kind of development to which she referred.

            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_612">I am raising this matter to ask the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to allow graduate architects to participate in the JobBridge scheme to fulfil the employment condition in their registration as an architect.  The Minister will be aware that to become an architect graduates study for five years and that having successfully completed their study, they must register to use the title "architect".  To register, they must first pass a professional examination and then - this is where the difficulty lies - be in paid employment in a professional architectural practice for two years.  I need hardly remind the House or the Minister that the construction industry has been decimated since 2008.  Of all those hit by the downturn in the industry, the architect profession has been hardest hit.  There is almost no design work available and there are few opportunities for young unregistered graduates.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">Were graduates to be granted access to the JobBridge scheme they could take up an internship which would, in turn, open the door to their professional examinations which they cannot take unless they have obtained work.  Graduate architects are excluded from participation in the JobBridge scheme on the basis that as they have a further examination to take, they are unavailable for employment.  However, that is not the case.  The Department has, since commencement of the recession, recognised the people concerned as been eligible for unemployment benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">I am asking the Minister to allow these graduates the opportunity to complete their qualifications through participation in the JobBridge scheme.  There are only about 150 such graduates each year.  While the OPW takes some of them on and a limited number find work in the private sector, the only option for the majority is emigration.  However, they are not recognised abroad as architects because they have not attained their final qualification.  The Minister is aware, having been in the House during the passage of legislation in this regard, that this registration is recognised across Europe.  Graduates are required to sit an examination to obtain their qualification, but to do so they must first obtain work.  However, under the current JobBridge scheme rules, they cannot get work because they must take an examination.  I ask the Minister to review the scheme with a view to facilitating these graduates.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection  (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_615">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The objective of JobBridge, the national internship scheme, is to assist individuals bridge the gap between unemployment and the world of work.  It provides those seeking employment with an opportunity to undertake a six or nine month internship in a host organisation.  Participation in the scheme will assist in breaking the cycle, whereby unemployed persons are unable to obtain a job without experience.  On completion of an internship, participants will have improved their prospects of securing employment</p>
            <p eId="para_616">The JobBridge scheme was launched on 29 June 2011.  In excess of 5,200 jobseekers have commenced internships.  There are 2,130 opportunities available across a wide number of sectors.  All of these opportunities are advertised on the JobBridge website <i>www.jobbridge.ie.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_617">In the current labour market environment the JobBridge scheme provides individuals with a unique opportunity to secure work experience in a new field.  The scheme enables people to break the cycle, whereby unemployed persons are unable to secure a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers whose existing skills are not appropriate to the jobs that will emerge in post-recession Ireland.  Eligibility to access the scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the live register.  It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the register.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy will be to keep those on the live register close to the labour market and prevent their drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure live register members availing of activation measures, including the national internship scheme, will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top-up allowance of €50, receive an opportunity to engage in the workplace to gain work experience and thus be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.  For these reasons, eligibility for the scheme is targeted at those on the live register and in receipt of jobseeker payments or signing for credits for at least 78 days of the last six months.  In so designing the scheme the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources for those on the live register to increase their chances of leaving it and ensure a reduction in Exchequer costs overtime.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">The scheme is open to host organisations to provide internship opportunities for qualified architects.  To date, there are in excess of 20 architect internship posts advertised on the JobBridge website.  The Department is reviewing the operation of the JobBridge scheme and its possible extension, including broadening its eligibility criteria.  The issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in the context of the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_620">I welcome the Minister's response.  As stated by her, the purpose of the JobBridge scheme is to bring people closer to employment.  However, in this case - it is a bizarre anomaly - it is keeping people from employment.  The Government has gone to a lot of trouble to assist young apprentices to finish their apprenticeships and these young graduate architects are in a similar position.  As the Minister will be aware, they are limited in number and the OPW provides a number of them with well paid work experience which, in turn, allows them to take their professional examinations.  It is welcome that the scheme is being reviewed.  In that context, I ask the Minister not to close the door to these graduates.  This anomaly makes no sense, as it affects people who have done a great deal of study and have no prospect of gaining employment in this country in the immediate future.</p>

            <p eId="para_621">The Department has received requests to participate in the scheme from lone parents and people with disabilities.  A general review of the scheme which has proved very popular is being undertaken.  Many are anxious to avail of the opportunities advertised on the JobBridge website.  I will undertake to have graduate architects who have not formally completed their professional examinations included in the scheme and come back to the Deputy on the matter.  It is hoped the review will be completed in a couple of months time.</p>

            <p eId="para_622">I raise the matter of the need for reform of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan on the first anniversary of the murder of Mr. Shabaz Bhatti, a former Pakistani Federal Minister for Minorities who was an outspoken critic of these laws.  He also supported the case of Mrs. Asia Bibi who was imprisoned under these laws and whose case is on appeal.  The matter is being raised on a cross-party basis and with the support of Independent Deputies.  It is also being raised today in a number of parliaments throughout the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">I call on the Government to reiterate our support for Articles 18 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which acknowledges the rights to freedom of religion and speech and for the reform of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan.  A number of parties in Pakistan support the call for their reform and attempts have previously been made to this end, including by the ruling party in Pakistan.  A Bill brought forward last year by a Pakistan People's Party Member of Parliament aimed at their reform was withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">A great deal of pressure is exerted internally in Pakistan not to reform the blasphemy laws.  There are different reforms that could be introduced.  Many convictions are achieved in the lower courts and it has been proposed that such matters should, in the first instance, be dealt with in the higher courts.  It is important that a friendly country such a Ireland put pressure on Pakistan to reform the laws and the government will need the support of other countries in doing so.</p>

            <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
            <p eId="para_625">I add my voice to those of my colleagues from the other political parties and the Independent benches in support of Articles 18 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  They acknowledge the rights of freedom of religion and freedom of speech, which comprise some of the basic human rights a person can have.  At my party's conference over the weekend, I spoke on true republicanism and on liberty, equality and fraternity.  We are fortunate to live in a republic in which one can have freedom of speech and religion.  Unfortunately, for many years these were not always tolerated but, thankfully, that no longer is the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">I support my colleagues on this issue, which we have raised on the anniversary of the horrific murder of the former Pakistani Federal Minister for Minorities.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should bring forward all possible pressure to ensure Pakistan reforms its blasphemy law.  I support this because I consider the recognition of a crime of blasphemy to offend the basic human rights of freedom of religion and speech.  I believe all governments have a duty to protect their citizens from violent religious extremists.  We are fortunate we do not suffer in this country in that regard and I support my colleagues in urging the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring to bear any pressure he can on the Pakistani Government.</p>

          <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_379">
            <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_627">I acknowledge the work of Deputy Tuffy and Mr. David Turner in organising a petition on the case of Mrs. Asia Bibi last September, which was a first positive step.  Ireland is seeking election to the United Nations Human Rights Council for the 2013-2015 term, and we deserve that seat.  We have a fine reputation in respect of relationships with other countries and with regard to our development aid budget.  Like Deputy Mac Lochlainn, I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, at which this point was being made.  I also heard the same point last night at a presentation by various NGOs.  As we know Ireland has such a reputation and has a voice that is listened to, I believe it has a role in this regard, even though it concerns a country that is far distant from Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">Governor Salman Taseer was murdered in January 2011 and this was followed in March 2011 by the murder of the Federal Minister, Shahbaz Bhatti.  They were two brave men who spoke out against Pakistan's blasphemy laws and paid with their lives.  The situation now has arisen concerning the aforementioned lady, Mrs. Asia Bibi, who is in jail.  Part of her difficulty is that no date has been given and, consequently, she could remain in jail for a number of years before her case is heard.  In common with my colleagues, I advocate marking this anniversary by reiterating our support for Articles 18 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  In her response, the Minister might indicate any correspondence the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has had with the Pakistani authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">I welcome the opportunity to add my party's support to this initiative from Deputy Tuffy and Mr. David Turner of the Church in Chains organisation.  A series of reprehensible events has led to this initiative today.  Unfortunately and sadly, many countries lack genuine religious freedom which is a fundamental human right.  Huge challenges exist in Pakistan for its Government to grapple with, but it has not met these challenges to date.  They include the murder of one of its own Ministers, who was leading a campaign to reform the blasphemy laws and who was trying to address the injustices within that country.  The purpose of raising this Topical Issue matter is to show solidarity and unity.  I am certain that all political parties and Independent Members in this House will unite to send a message to the Pakistani Government that it must address this issue.  We are partners with Pakistan in the global community.  While it has an embassy in and relationships with this country which we value immensely, this issue must be addressed.  I hope the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will meet the Pakistani ambassador on foot of this topical matter and will engage with the Pakistani Government to convey the concerns of his House to it and to ask it to address these issues.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_381" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_630">I thank Deputies Tuffy, Troy, Mac Lochlainn and Maureen O'Sullivan for raising this important matter.  Human rights are and always have been a priority of successive Irish Governments and a key plank of their foreign policy.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources, including both official channels and non-governmental or civil society organisations.  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">The Government remains concerned about the case of Mrs. Asia Bibi.  In November 2010 a Punjabi court found Mrs. Bibi guilty of blasphemy and sentenced her to death by hanging.  This is the first time a woman has been sentenced to death in Pakistan under its blasphemy law.  When the case came to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the ambassador accredited to Pakistan at the time called upon the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad to convey Ireland's concern at the conviction and sentence.  He also expressed our disquiet at the nature of Pakistan's blasphemy law.  Since that time, a number of representations have been made to the Embassy of Pakistan by senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Mrs. Bibi's case and Pakistan's blasphemy laws were discussed at length during bilateral political consultations in Dublin in 2011, which were held with the Pakistani Additional Foreign Secretary for Europe.  In the course of these consultations, Ireland's concerns about the conviction, the sentence and the nature of Pakistan's blasphemy laws again were strongly expressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">At the European level, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, also has expressed her concerns at the Bibi judgement and others like it and has called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions to which it is a party.  The EU engages in regular dialogue with Pakistan on human rights and democratic principles, including religious discrimination.  The EU has called on the Pakistani authorities, at the highest level, to adopt measures to protect individual and minority rights in line with its constitution and with international human rights standards and conventions.  The EU has made clear to the Government of Pakistan that under its constitutional and international requirements, it has a responsibility to protect its citizens regardless of their faith.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">The controversial application of the blasphemy laws is a source of deep concern for the EU.  In the view of Ireland and its EU partners, the blasphemy laws in their current form are open to abuse.  Most recently in the EU-Pakistan dialogue on human rights that took place in February 2012, the EU expressed concerns at the rise of fundamentalist and sectarian violence and encouraged the Government of Pakistan to reform the blasphemy laws, emphasising nevertheless that the response needs to be broader and that real efforts to counter intolerance must come from Pakistan itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">Respect for human rights is a cornerstone of foreign policy for both Ireland and the European Union as a whole.  The Pakistani Government has made commitments to protect religious minorities and to promote religious tolerance.  However, real and tangible progress on the ground is what is required.  I urge the Pakistani Government to resolve Mrs. Bibi's case as soon as possible and to initiate a thorough review of its blasphemy law, including the use of the death penalty.  I also ask it to respond to the concerns of Ireland and the international community by addressing the conditions of Mrs. Bibi's detention.  Mrs. Bibi's case will continue to be followed closely by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and officials in his Department will remain in contact with the Pakistani authorities on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">The elimination of religious intolerance and persecution has been at the forefront of Ireland's human rights agenda for the past 20 years.</p>

I hope pressure will continue to be exerted in any bilateral discussions involving the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and both the Government of Pakistan and that county's embassy here.  I also hope that what the Minister for Social Protection stated in her reply will be conveyed to the Pakistani embassy.  I acknowledge the efforts of the Church in Chains organisation, to which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred earlier, in respect of this matter.  Church in Chains has done a great deal of work in the context of keeping this matter on the agenda and in keeping Deputies informed.</p>

I encourage the Government to continue on its current path in the context of highlighting this issue at every level to ensure that Mrs. Bibi's case will be resolved as quickly as possible.  As long as the blasphemy laws in Pakistan remain as they stand, there is a danger that similar cases will arise.  Unless the legislation in Pakistan is amended, there will be further problems.  The Government should continue to work with the EU to ensure religious freedom and freedom of speech will  be protected.</p>

            <p eId="para_638">One of the other alarming aspects of cases of this nature is the way in which death sentences are carried out by mobs.  I accept that the Pakistani Government has indicated that it is committed to this issue.  However, it appears to be talking the talk rather than walking the walk.  Given that the anniversary of the murder of the late Minister for minorities has just passed, I am of the view that strong representations should be made to the Pakistani ambassador and that he should be asked to take this matter further.</p>

A petition signed by 26 Oireachtas Members from various parties has been given to the Pakistani ambassador.  The Pakistani Government is, therefore, aware of the views of politicians of all hues in this House and that of the Government.  However, it is time for action to be taken.  It is intolerable that religious discrimination and human rights abuses are accepted in Pakistan to the point where even a Government Minister who was trying to take action on this matter was assassinated.  It is time to move beyond the niceties of diplomacy and demand that the Pakistani Government offer a more appropriate response.  I request that the Tánaiste communicate with the four Deputies who raised this matter and provide them with a report on the further steps he proposes to take in respect of it.</p>

We are on the eve of International Women's Day and the sentiments expressed by the Deputies provide a strong indication of the difficulties experienced by women in confinement.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">It is approximately ten years since the people voted to formally end the use of the death penalty in this country by having the appropriate clause inserted in the Constitution.  As a result, our opposition to the death penalty is now reflected in that document.  Ireland is acknowledged internationally as being one of the countries which is most strong in raising matters of this nature bilaterally with the relevant governments, at the EU and at the relevant UN fora.  I will convey to the Tánaiste the sentiments expressed by the Deputies.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_642">This issue relates to the loss of 41 long-term care beds at St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park, which is located in my constituency.  The closure of these beds follows on from a recommendation from the Health Information Quality Authority, HIQA.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, can imagine the concern and stress to which this has given rise among the residents and patients at St. Mary's and among their families and members of the wider community.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">Bed closures have been causing chaos throughout the hospital system for many years.  We have reached the point where not only are adults being left on trolleys but now children are also being left on them.  There are reports of sick children lying on trolleys in hospital corridors for up to 24 days.  I am sure the Minister of State is fully aware that there is a direct correlation between delayed discharges from hospitals, on one hand, and waiting lists for those who require long-term care beds in hospitals such as St. Mary's, on the other.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">We all know that the cost of placing a person in a long-term care bed is only a fraction of the cost of keeping them in a regular hospital bed.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and his special adviser, who is extremely well paid, are both aware of this.  It is worth noting that the Minister's most senior adviser, Dr. Martin Connor - the man responsible for the special delivery unit - was awarded a three-year contract worth €480,00 in December.  Dr. Connor devotes 80% of his working hours to the Minister and I understand the remainder are dedicated to his position as a research fellow at Stanford University in California.  Sara Burke, a health analyst and journalist, recently noted that Dr. Connor has attended just four of the 13 HSE board meetings held since his appointment last June.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">The HSE's regional service plan 2012 states that across the entire north-east region - which covers Louth, Meath, Cavan, Monaghan and Dublin city and county - between 200 to 250 additional long-term care beds will be provided in the current year.  The same document also states that in view of the staffing and financial challenges which the HSE faces, the closure of some beds is unavoidable.  It further states that it is not expected that closures of public long-term care beds will exceed 105 for the north-east region.  We are just over two months into 2012 and now one hospital in north Dublin is due to lost 41 beds.  Is the Minister of State in a position to make a commitment to our citizens that the net loss of public long-term care beds will not exceed 105?  I suspect that she will not be in a position to give an undertaking in this regard.  In the context of St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park, the Minister of State must indicate how the 41 beds that are due to be lost will be replaced.  She must also state whether these beds will be replaced within the north Dublin catchment area.</p>

            <p eId="para_646">I will adhere strictly to the script with which I have been provided when making my initial reply but I hope the Deputy and I might be able to engage in a little more free-flowing exchange of views thereafter.  I thank her for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">St. Mary's Hospital was built in 1769.  It was originally the Royal Hibernian Military School.  The building was subsequently developed as a hospital by the Irish Army.  In 1948 it was transferred to the Dublin Health Authority and developed as a chest hospital.  In 1964 the hospital became a facility for older people.  St. Mary's primarily provides accommodation to dependent older persons aged 65 years or over who require admission, assessment, rehabilitation, respite and continuing care.  Following an inspection by HIQA towards the end of 2011, the HSE decided to close two wards at the hospital.  The Deputy will appreciate that certain wards in the older parts of the facility are extremely antiquated and are, by their nature, unfit for purpose.  It should be noted also that at the time of building the new community nursing units at St. Mary's Hospital in 2008, it was envisaged that bed numbers in the older part of the facility would be reduced.  One such ward has closed and the residents have been transferred to more appropriate residential care facilities in the area.  A second ward is being closed, bringing the total reduction to 41 beds.  Staff are working with the residents and their families to ensure residents are placed in the most appropriate care settings for their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">As the Deputy is aware, the HSE is facing challenges in respect of all services in 2012.  In the case of community nursing units, these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.  The HSE national service plan anticipates that between a minimum of 555 and maximum of 898 residential beds in public nursing homes could close during 2012.  We are working very intently on that issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has requested that the HSE provide him with a plan which seeks to protect the viability of as many units as possible within the funding and staffing resources available.  It is accepted that this will require a combination of actions such as consolidation of services and changes in staffing, skill mix and work practices.  The plan will also have to take into account different types of services required, the age and structure of public units and the capacity available within an area.  All developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and any decisions taken by the HSE must have regard to this and the current moratorium.  I trust the House and the Deputy will agree that we need to ensure that the highest standard of care will continue to be provided to all residents in a safe and secure environment.  Providing quality and safe care will always remain at the heart of any consideration.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_650">Quality and safe care must be at the heart of service provision.  The manner in which very many of the families discovered the news that beds were being lost and a second ward was to be closed was much less than satisfactory.  It began as a sort of whisper and rumour and I should reiterate the level of anxiety that this caused.  I appreciate entirely that budgetary considerations are real and the moratorium and other strands of Government policy are causing significant difficulties in the health service.  In the case of care for older people, other factors must also be calculated, including the attachment of the person in question to their place of residence, the concerns and anxieties of the families and the adverse consequences of moving an older, weaker and perhaps vulnerable individual.  It is all very well to say that people have been moved to other appropriate facilities but one must also calculate the ability of families to access those facilities, and in this case those matters have not been properly calculated.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">I asked the Minister of State during the course of my remarks about the HSE service plans, which were mentioned in the response.  The HSE indicated that closure of some beds would be unavoidable and it did not expect that in the case of the north-east Dublin region the closures would exceed 105 beds.  Nevertheless we are 41 beds down in March.  Does the Government stand by the 105-bed figure and is it the case that those 41 beds will be replaced elsewhere?  Have they been counted out?  Does the Minister of State share my view that in dealing with these particular circumstances for older people the HSE, specifically, must be mindful of the age of the people concerned and the sensitivities of the families, which was not the case this time?</p>

            <p eId="para_652">As I do not have direct involvement in this issue, I am very much going on the information provided for me.  The ideal is for nobody to be disturbed but the condition of certain units means that people will have to be moved as patients cannot stay in units unfit for purpose.  This arises from independent evaluation from HIQA.  Such issues will occur and will continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">I have no reason not to believe the HSE service plan despite the Deputy noting that we are already 41 beds down very early in the year.  That had been planned since 2008 and the additional six new wards built on the site will accommodate 150 people.  People may be attached to where they live despite the conditions of the unit, which I understand perfectly, but nevertheless the new environment is far better, which we must accept.  I have no doubt the figure in the service plan will be adhered to.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">I have just come from the Sue Ryder Foundation facility in Dalkey, which is an extraordinary complex dealing with older people who live independently but who are supervised with supports.  There are people in our charge who need the type of long-term intensive care that people in nursing homes have; we must deal with them and be conscious of their needs and families.  Nevertheless, we must begin to change our processes and leading from this we can speak to the people living in the Sue Ryder complex, for example.  The Deputy knows them as well as I do.  They are living very happily without the type of intensive medical model that can be seen in other areas.  We must start to look at alternatives, including talking about stepping up as opposed to always talking about stepping down.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">With regard to facilities like St. Mary's Hospital, the new facility is far superior to the older one; it must be when one considers the age of the building and the needs of older people now as opposed to then.</p>

            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
            <p eId="para_656">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue and the Minister for being present to discuss it.  I welcome the Minister's publication of the Booz &amp; Company report, which is very comprehensive.  The company consulted widely and brought considerable experience to the report while reviewing international models for ownership and management of airports, which is helpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">The Minister is well aware that the report has identified five options and evaluated each in order to distil them into two broadly based recommendations identified in the report.  The first is termed a restructuring of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, with each airport given status as an independent subsidiary within an overall airport grouping, with each airport having an independent board with the capacity to set strategic direction, appoint management teams and develop business plans.  I would favour this and recommended it on behalf of my party in our submission to Booz &amp; Company.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">The second recommendation indicates that Shannon Airport could be separated from the other two airports, with a local concession established involving local authorities in Clare and Limerick and a regional development agency in the guise of Shannon Development.  It is clearly indicated that the capacity of Shannon Airport to survive either on its own or in a new structure would be less than viable if there were fewer than 5 million passengers.  There is mention of the airport being in real jeopardy in such a case and we are all concerned about that.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">Either of the two options recognise that Shannon has a significant problem and the difficulty is in a separated environment where it is cut adrift from an overall airport umbrella or the DAA.  In such a case it would be left with a cash requirement of approximately €8 million per year.  Involving the local authorities and Shannon Development or expecting that the land bank can be monetised in the current climate is farcical.  I accept the Minister has not made a determination on it, but I want to use the opportunity to clearly state the future viability of Shannon Airport would be compromised greatly if local authorities or Shannon Development were expected to provide additional revenues to meet the ongoing running costs of an airport which is the default location for transatlantic emergencies and required to be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  This service cannot be provided without a subvention, unless the number of passengers is 5 million.  The report clearly indicates this is not possible or feasible, even in the medium term.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">The report calls on the Government to clarify its overall aviation policy, which is important.  I expect in any review or restatement of the Government's policy on aviation regional development to be rightly identified as an important component.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">The report speaks about whether the Government needs to restate its position on competition.  I am not sure competition between the three State airports is such a big issue because they serve very different markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">The report mentions the benefits in having a less crowded airport landscape which may require the Minister to move towards reducing their number.  It also mentions the issues of debt and pensions which need to be addressed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport  (Deputy Leo Varadkar)</from>
            <p eId="para_663">Tá a fhios ag an Teachta gur chuir an Aire Iompair a bhí ann i 2008 an cinneadh maidir le scarúint Aerfort Chorcaí agus Aerfort na Sionainne, mar a bhí beartaithe faoin Acht um Aerfoirt Stáit 2004, ar ceal go dtí an bhliain seo caite.  Ar cúpla fáth, bhí an cinneadh sin curtha siar i ndiaidh achtú an reachtaíocht chumasúcháin.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir leanúint i bhfad níos faide leis an socrú atá ann ó 2004, ina bhfuil a mboird féin ag Aerfort Chorcaí agus Aerfort na Sionainne ach gan mórán saoirse ó Údarás Aerfort Bhaile Átha Cliath a bheith acu.  Ní féidir leanúint ach an oiread leis an meicníocht ina bhfuil caillteanais Aerfort Chorcaí agus Aerfort na Sionainne á ghlacadh ag Údarás Aerfort Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Tá mé den tuairim go bhfuil sé in am cinntí daingne a thógáil faoi todhchaí na haerfoirt.  As a first step in the process, I consulted the Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airport authorities on separation and their unanimous view was there was no support for separation, as originally envisaged under the State Airports Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">Taking account of these responses and following a public procurement process, I commissioned Booz &amp; Company to identify and analyse all likely options regarding the ownership and operation of Cork and Shannon Airports and make clear recommendations on the optimal ownership and operational structures for them.  The consultants who are experts in aviation matters with international experience were asked to consult as widely as possible with stakeholders in Cork and Shannon on sustainable options for the two airports.  Their report was finalised and submitted to me in December.  The report analyses the viability and sustainability of Cork and Shannon Airports and, on this basis, suggests two recommended approaches with regard to their future.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">A redacted version of the report is available on my Department's website at <i>www.dttas.ie</i> with any commercially sensitive information omitted.  I do not propose to go into the detail of the consultants’ recommendations now, as, even with these redactions, their recommendations are clear for anyone interested in accessing the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">The contents of the report were noted by the Government at a meeting at the end of January.  We are now engaging with relevant stakeholders and the Deputy will appreciate a number of complex issues must be resolved before final decisions can be made.  These include the financial implications for the airports in the event of a change in the <i>status quo</i>; the DAA pension deficit; the continued downturn in the aviation market and the possible need for legislative changes.  However, when I have consulted all relevant stakeholders, I intend to bring proposals to the Government on the future of Cork and Shannon Airports.  I hope to be in a position to do this around Easter.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">We can all agree that the <i>status quo</i> at Shannon Airport is not working well and that this year its passenger numbers continue to fall, particularly as a result of the reduction in the number of military flights.  Passenger numbers at Cork Airport are increasing, while those at Dublin Airport are falling slightly.  As the Deputy pointed out, two models have been put forward.  One of these is the CIE model which is an option, but I am not yet satisfied it would result in sufficient change because an independent subsidiarity which requires another for subvention is not really independent.  The other option is full independence, the detail of which must be figured out because I can only recommend it to the Government if I believe it will be financially viable.  I am not willing to do anything that I do not believe in my heart will be a success.  The whole point of the process is to make a success of an airport which has been in decline for some time.  Whatever happens I assure anyone with concerns that the airport will stay open.  Business interests have raised concerns that there could be a risk to Heathrow flights.  Certainly, the airport will remain open and there are no concerns about flights on any of the existing routes.  I have discussed the matter with the airlines and assure people in the business community in the region that, based on the information I have available, there is no threat to long-term access.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_393">
            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
            <p eId="para_668">I thank the Minister and appreciate his clarification.  He spoke about subvention and the difficulty that a subsidiary would not be independent if it was dependent on another for subvention.  The Booz &amp; Company report makes it clear that an airport with fewer than 5 million passengers would not be self-sustaining.  Therefore, it would require a subvention from somewhere and it would be from one arm of the State or another.  One cannot expect local authorities to find a fanciful pool of money in the current climate.  The Minister is sitting beside the Minister of Finance who is well aware that local authorities do not have the money required; neither does Shannon Development.  There was a time when it had a strong rent roll or revenue generating capacity from its asset base, but this has been well compromised because of the downturn in its revenue streams.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">The Minister is looking at allowing the local authorities to close the airport should it fall into their hands, as they would be left with no choice but to scale down operations and ultimately close it because of the very significant cost of running it.  Even with trimming back airport operations further, I cannot see how it has the capacity to survive.  The Minister has made the point that what is needed is something that will initiate growth.  I do not know how this growth in passenger numbers will be generated in the short term.  At best, as some seek to suggest, with independent status, the airport could somehow compete with Cork and Dublin Airports, but I doubt it has the capacity to compete effectively in this space.  All that would happen is passengers would be taken from these airports, which would ultimately compromise their balance sheets and revenue streams.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">We need an overall policy.  In fairness, the Minister has been working on such a policy through some of the measures he has introduced to increase the level of inward activity which will help all of the airports.  However, he must look at the provision of a subvention as the only realistic method of retaining the airport and ensuring its future viability.  I question his capacity to subvent it in a separated environment.  He can continue to do so while it is attached via an umbilical cord to the umbrella group or the CIE model but outside this he would have real difficulties.  Whether he likes it, he may not be in a position to prevent its ultimate closure if there is a further deterioration in economic activity or the level of airline travel.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_394" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_671">I appreciate what the Deputy says about airports with fewer than 5 million passengers not being sustainable, but there are airports throughout the world with passenger numbers of approximately 1 million which are sustainable.  They have to match their operations with the level of sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">Local authorities may have a role to play in ensuring the future of Shannon Airport, but I do not believe it will be their role to subvent or run it.  Notwithstanding the fact that there are very strong local authorities in the region, they do not have the skills to do this and it is not what was intended.  When the consultants were examining this issue, they might have been thinking more of Manchester and Leeds-Bradford Airports, but they are within the remit of very different local authorities for areas of population of 1 million to 4 million people.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">The overall policy has been to reduce the number of airports.  To this end, subvention has been withdrawn from Galway and Sligo Airports.  Over time other airports being subvented will have to break even.  By 2014 it will be unusual or unique for any airport to receive a subvention.  This needs to be borne in mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">On the future of Shannon Airport, its debt presents a big issue.  As the Deputy mentioned, it needs approximately €8 million in cash to break even.  If this debt can be written down or part of it left with the Dublin Airport Authority, it would drastically reduce the subvention.  This is one of the issues that must be considered.  Notwithstanding what action will be taken, at a minimum some form of golden share arrangement will be required to ensure the Government can step in again to ensure there is no risk or concern of closure at any stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_675">Bearing in mind the discussions on the forthcoming referendum, the main crux of the issue arising in respect of Greece is that we must be mindful of the member states of the European Union which make a net contribution to the financing on which the remaining countries rely.  We must, therefore, establish structures to ensure the problems facing Greece and, to a lesser extent, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain, cannot recur.  While we have an economic union and a semi-political union in Europe, the strict criteria required to bind the Union together and provide governance and supervision was wholly absent in the case of Greece.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">As I noted yesterday, the Greek people have taken on a major burden, as have people in this country.  Comments made in the House yesterday about how the Greek Government has addressed problems in Greece were insensitive.  It is a sovereign government which has dealt effectively with its problems and has taken some difficult decisions.  In fairness to the other 26 member states, this has been shown to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Circumstances in Greece and, to a lesser extent, Ireland show the importance of passing the forthcoming referendum to secure access to the European Stability Mechanism in future.  We do not know what lies ahead.  Countries which find themselves in difficulty in future - I hope they will be few and far between and their difficulties will be much less severe than those Europe currently faces - must have access to the mechanism that will act as a firewall to prevent their economies from collapsing.  There is currently no mechanism in place to allow a country to leave the euro, nor should countries be forced out of the single currency.  We must ensure that taxpayers in compliant member states that live within their means have an assurance that their taxes are being spent wisely, their efforts respected by other member states and everyone is playing by the same rules.  This has not been the case until now.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">I wish the Minister well in the difficult negotiations that lie ahead and on Ireland's role as EU President.  I do so not only because he and I are both natives of west County Limerick but also because he has an unenviable task, one that could shape the future of the economy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_679">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2012.  The legislation aims to ensure the financial stability of the European Union and safeguard the stability of the euro.  It is required to give effect in law to amendments and measures agreed by EU Heads of State and Government last July.  In recent years, we have had unprecedented volatility in the financial markets in Europe and every country has struggled to ascertain the implications of these developments for its citizens.  During this time, debate on the European project has ground to a halt, as every country seeks to ameliorate the extent to which it is affected by the Europe-wide volatility.  We must not lose sight of the tremendous benefits the European project has brought to Ireland and Europe, namely, peace and political stability, mechanisms for agreeing a way forward in the interests of all European citizens, the Single Market and the common currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The Euro Area Loan Facility Bill is a common sense measure.  We must learn from the mistakes that led to the current financial impasse and plan ahead to ensure such mistakes are not repeated.  Excessive lending and budget deficits were at the heart of the creation of the current crisis.  The Bill seeks to establish protocols to avoid repeating the mistakes of yesteryear and create a financial environment that is safer for citizens across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">There is a price to be paid for the Bill and the stability it aims to create.  Essentially, the interest Greece is required to pay to Ireland will be reduced by €5.2 million.  This is only a small part of the burden faced by our Greek partners.  It should be noted that Ireland has benefited from a €9 billion reduction in the interest to be paid on our loans from EU sources.  Some 400 years ago, the logic behind the euro area loan facility was recognised when the Bard of Avon stated succinctly:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_682">Neither a borrower nor a lender be,For loan oft loses both itself and friend,And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">We must look to the future, one in which neither excessive borrowing nor lending are features of our economic policy.  To do otherwise would undoubtedly result in losses for Ireland and our friends in Europe and beyond.  The Shakespeare maxim I cited is used in household budgets across the land.  The same logic must be applied to the nation's finances as we seek to keep borrowing and spending to a minimum to ensure essential services are maintained while constantly reducing the budget deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The Minister for Finance has faced up to a number of difficult budget decisions and more will surely follow in the period ahead as he seeks to rectify the mistakes of the past when excessive borrowing dulled the edge of our economic husbandry.  Ireland will clearly need to access finance in 2013.  Thus, it is in the interests of all citizens that the groundwork be done now to reduce market volatility and plan a way forward.  This would ease the current crisis and reduce the possibility of a repeat of the calamitous events of recent years.  The Bill before us goes some way towards achieving this objective.  While people's fears and worries must be taken on board, it is fundamental to the future of the country that this legislation is enacted here and elsewhere in Europe in order that the Continent proceeds in a cohesive manner in terms of the parameters for the new loan facility.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_397">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_685">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2012, the purpose of which is to enable Ireland to confirm acceptance of the second amendment to the Greek loan facility, GLF, as part of the proposed new programme of assistance for Greece.  While the legislation contains numerous measures, at its core it is simply about showing benevolence to our fellow man.  This will have an economic cost to the State in the form of the reduced interest payments we receive from the Greek Government.  At approximately €5.2 million per annum, these reduced sums are not insignificant.  However, these payments are based on a sum of €345 million we provided for Greece before entering our EU-IMF programme.  As Deputies will agree, those were different times.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The Government, specifically the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has since successfully and skilfully negotiated a €9 billion reduction in the interest cost associated with our borrowing from EU sources.  Does anyone seriously suggest that we should benefit to the tune of €9 billion while denying or, to put it another way, begrudging a country such as Greece a reduction of €5.2 million?  I may be many things but a hypocrite I am not.  Given that the amendment is being made in the spirit of solidarity with our Greek colleagues, I share the Government's view that this is a small amount to assist a country in serious difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Another aspect of the Bill should not be overlooked, namely, the objective of facilitating, in the public interest, the financial stability of the European Union and safeguarding of the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.  Financial stability must be of the utmost importance because stability in anything, whether markets, currencies, interest rates or peace processes, has an immense collective benefit.  It provides assurance, and when people are assured, they develop confidence, which opens up new opportunities and breathes life into communities and markets.  I have witnessed this at first hand in Drogheda with the recent and continued success of the "Local Heroes" initiative.  Not content with the success of an initial trade mission, a second trade mission will leave the town bound for Silicon Valley later this week, with the explicit aim of encouraging new business for the town and greater area.  In addition, the mission will showcase some exciting new emerging companies from the greater Drogheda area.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Also in my constituency I have witnessed at first hand the benefits of stability and consistent tax rates with the recent high profile arrivals in Dundalk of companies such as Prometric and PayPal.  These highly welcome investments provide a welcome boost to the town and will greatly change the unemployment landscape.  As a result, it would be remiss and almost hypocritical of me not to favour bestowing such benefits on our Greek counterparts when they are in severe financial difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">My constituency, in particular the town of Dundalk, has suffered more than most from currency and interest rate movements over the years.  There is a simple saying in the greater Louth area which is particularly pertinent to our Greek friends: "One never kicks a man when he is down."  With that thought in mind, I do not have any hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_690">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The purpose of the legislation is to enable Ireland to confirm its acceptance of the second amendment to the Greek loan facility as part of the proposed new programme of assistance for Greece and to facilitate, in the public interest, with which all of us will agree, the financial stability of the EU and the safeguarding and financial stability of the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">It was agreed on foot of an intergovernmental treaty in May 2010 to set up the Greek loan facility to provide bilateral loans totalling €80 billion to Greece from eurozone member states in conjunction with an IMF assistance programme of €30 billion over a three-year period.  This was a few short months before Ireland had to enter a similar agreement with the IMF, the EU and the ECB.  All signatories to the Greek loan facility agreement have been requested to provide their acceptance to this amendment to the facility by 13 March.  This was finalised only on 27 February.  The Bill has been presented to the House at the first available opportunity and we are happy on this side of the House to facilitate its passage.  I understand the President will sign the legislation as a matter of urgency in order that there is no hiccup regarding the deadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">One of the Bill's provisions reflects agreement among the Eurogroup ministers on 20 February that there would be a reduction in the margin payable under this loan facility of 150 basis points.  The Minister made it clear last night that Ireland provided €345.7 million to Greece through the original loan facility before it entered the EU-IMF programme.  When we entered the programme, we left the Greek loan facility because countries in an IMF programme are not expected to contribute and, therefore, we are relying on countries that are not in such programmes to carry the can.  However, it is important that quarterly interest payments are made by Greece.  The reduction in the interest rate by 150 basis points will mean the Exchequer will receive €5.2 million per annum throughout the lifetime of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">An extension of the grace period from four and a half to ten years before Greece begins to repay the loan principal is provided for and the maturity of the loan will be extended from 7.5 to 15 years.  Is it possible for Ireland to exit the agreement and seek early repayment of the €345.7 million we put in in good faith before we entered the IMF programme?  I am not sure of the status of such a proposal but if there is a reduction in the interest repayment the Exchequer receives on an annual basis, I assume the capital amount we put in before we entered our IMF programme is still in this loan facility.  Could a mechanism be agreed as part of the Minister's discussions with the troika to retain the €345.7 million for at least the next ten years?  Everybody knows the difficult position Ireland is in and would agree that this amount would be beneficial in the context of dealing with our own debts.  I recognise we provided the money in good faith but events overtook us quickly and, perhaps, it is an issue that should be tabled for future discussions with the troika to ascertain whether a mechanism could be provided for Ireland to regain that funding to use it for its own purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">The agreement has not been arrived at without the people of Greece suffering a great deal of pain.  We see Greek people on the streets almost every night.  A new government and Prime Minister are in place but it must be recognised the government is not democratically elected.  The democratically elected government had to be replaced at the insistence of the people who were owed money by Greece and I look forward to the return of democratically elected governments in Greece and Italy at the first available opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">To achieve greater compliance, new efforts are under way to install "an enhanced and permanent troika presence on the ground" in Greece. I do not like this phrase used by the troika because it is too similar to "troops on the ground".  In addition, the troika will open an escrow account for Greece.  In other words, from now on the troika will pay off Greek bondholders and withhold funds to the Greek Government.  It is taking charge of banks accounts on behalf of the state and Greek acceptance of the new account was the greatest surrender of fiscal sovereignty by an industrialised country in recent history.  A government, which was not democratically elected, has agreed to the troika taking control of its bank accounts and the troika will pay the bondholders and meet Greece's international commitments before paying for health and social services.  Apart from having people on the ground, the troika is taking full control.  This is the equivalent of a company going into receivership with the receiver <i>in situ</i> on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Ireland is not Greece, as the Minister has stated several times, and it is important to restate that.  Greece is in a much worse position.  Part of the problem is people could not accept or believe some of the figures coming out of the country.  An element of the agreement is private sector involvement.  It will be different from all previous agreements because it provides for a bail-in where Greece's private sector creditors, albeit on a voluntary basis, will be encouraged to exchange their existing bonds for new ones with a lower nominal value.  If this is done voluntarily, it will avoid triggering a credit default.  Those who issue credit default insurance will not consider this to be a default and there will not be a payout.  Some people in the private sector would prefer to trigger a default in order that they could cash in their insurance policies.  However, under this agreement, they will voluntarily agree to exchange bonds under pressure from various governments.  Private sector involvement will result in the value of debt held by Greek bondholders being reduced by 75% and with the additional participation of external bondholders, the debt burden will reduce by approximately €100 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The ECB and the central banks of eurozone members are not included in the private sector deal.  The ECB is the largest holder of Greek debt with some saying it is of the order of €40 billion.  It was acquired as part of the securities markets programme last year.  In the past year, because people were concerned about a Greek default, senior bondholders were selling off Greek debt because they were afraid they would take a hit in the long term and the ECB through various mechanisms purchased them at a reduced price.  This means the bank will make a killing in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">Recently, the European Commission President, José Manuel Barroso, said more than €20 billion in Structural Funds are available to Greece under the 2007 to 2013 programme.  To date, €8 billion has been released but there is scope to do much more between now and next year.  Another €7 billion could be released.  The Structural Funds are part of a long-standing set up where money is spread around the EU according to economic need.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">In response to concerns about Greece's history of mismanagement of EU funds, President Barroso stated, "Now the sense of urgency is completely different," and hoped Greece would manage the structural funds properly from now on in the interest of achieving some level of growth in the economy.  The head of the group of eurozone finance Ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker, said only a week ago - this is possibly the troubling aspect of what we are talking about - that Greece might need a third bailout.  He also said, however, that he wanted to concentrate on the second bailout of €130 billion, which we are facilitating in this legislation and which aims to cut Greece's debt to 121% of GDP by 2020.  We must bear in mind that our debt is expected to be of that magnitude in the next few years.  If Mr. Juncker is saying that a certain level of debt could lead to a further bailout, although he was not speaking about Ireland, it is not unreasonable to extrapolate that his comments could also apply to countries in similar financial situations.  The Irish financial situation is not a whole lot different because our debt-to-GDP ratio will be of the order of 120%.  In this regard, it is important that the Government seek a reduction in the bank debt portion of our overall Government debt.  Overall, the banking crisis has cost us €60 billion to €70 billion, which represents about 40% of our total debt as a State.  Most people will accept that a debt-to-GDP ratio of 120% is too high and too close to the Greek figure that is causing alarm.  Those who are owed money as part of our bank debt must reduce this bank debt to Ireland.  Our debt must be sustainable in the future.  As I have just mentioned, Jean-Claude Juncker is afraid that a debt of 120%, which could be owed by Greece by 2020, might not be sustainable and might necessitate a further bailout.  The view is that such a debt-to-GDP ratio is a particular difficulty.  Our debt must be sustainable, but at that level it is on the edge of unsustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I welcome the Government's action, as mentioned in reports on RTE recently, on promissory notes.  It should not be a matter of restructuring interest rates and schedules of repayment; there must be a reduction in the actual debt.  I am separating the 40% or so of our total debt that relates to the banking collapse from the amount of money the State ran up in deficits on an annual basis and that are still being run up, albeit at a lower rate, to pay for basic public services.  Nobody can dispute that we did that to pay our doctors, nurses, teachers and social welfare recipients.  We cannot get away from that.  However, there must be a reduction in the bank debt.  Those people who lent to Ireland for this purpose must agree to reducing the level of debt.  They must be asked to do this by the Government and they must be genuinely pressed to reduce the amount.  They must agree to an actual reduction in the debt and not just a jiggling around of rates of interest and schedules of repayment.  Movement around the edges is not sufficient on this important issue.  There have been bailouts in various countries, and these creditors must be now asked to bail in and be part of the solution.  It is in their own financial interest to do this.  They must, as part of this process, reduce the bank debt they are holding on behalf of the Irish State, which accounts for approximately 40% of the total Government debt.  We can go nowhere in terms of revitalising the economy unless there is an actual reduction in the level of bank debt.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_703">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate and to show solidarity with our European partners and the people of Greece.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">It is ironic, and worth noting by the members of the Fine Gael Party who are here - since there is nobody else in the House - that although there has been much criticism of the German parliamentary committees' discussions of matters to do with Ireland, we now have the opportunity to discuss matters concerning Greece.  It must be acknowledged that countries in a Union are linked in terms of their operation and functioning.  It is a credit to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that this morning the Opposition started to suggest that the once impossible prospect of any renegotiation of interest rates or rescheduling of loans will now not be good enough.  One Independent Deputy, who is one of the most negative and pessimistic individuals in the country, said that even a full and total write-off of our banking debt would still not be adequate.  This serves to show exactly how negative our Opposition has become.  I wish the Minister continued success in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">That Greece is in a worse position than Ireland is not something that should give us any satisfaction, but it is important to emphasise that the nature of our debt is very specific and is different not only from that of Greece but also from those of other European countries.  Our debt was caused by a property bubble, bank failure and a failure of Government oversight in the past number of years.  Our other key economic indicators are continuing to improve slowly but steadily, which goes against four or five years of steady disimprovement.  Today we have seen small increases in the number of people in employment; our economy grew last year and it is believed it will continue to grow this year.  Perhaps most importantly, our competitiveness has significantly improved in recent years.  Those measures combined will show that Ireland has a strong future.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">There has been discussion of a second bailout, and today I heard members of the Opposition talking about a third bailout for Greece.  There is no doubt such talk, particularly in Ireland's case, is extremely unhelpful.  Based on most of the economic predictions, it seems we will not require a second bailout; nor should we wish to see a third one in Greece.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">There has been some pretty unfair commentary about democracy in Greece.  The leadership of Greece has been established as the democratically elected Parliament.  While few could argue that it is ideal, it is wrong to suggest that somehow the people of Greece, and the people of Italy, have lost their democratic leadership.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">With the Greek write-down of debt, its debt-to-GDP ratio will come close to Ireland's in the next few years.  It is extremely important, however, to note that our projected debt-to-GDP ratio of 119% by 2013 represents a maximum figure which has been achieved by working through our programme.  There is significant potential for reduction of that figure.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_404">
          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_711">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, the aims of which I support.  Without repeating what previous speakers have said, I appreciate the difficulties and hardships that have been inflicted on people in Greece in recent years.  They certainly do not deserve to be preyed on or spoken about in the House in the manner in which they have. People in Greece are suffering.  This legislation is an attempt to provide a longer term solution to the difficulties in Greece.  A number of important dates will emerge in the next few days with regard to what is proposed in the legislation.  I understand tomorrow is the last day for signing up for private sector involvement, which is a crucial aspect of the legislation.  Tomorrow, 8 March, is the last day to sign up for the Greek bond swap offer.  This legislation is noteworthy in that it is very different from many of the discussions we have had on this issue previously.  That private sector involvement is included is a significant new departure.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">I commend the Minister, Deputy Noonan, for his ongoing negotiations on the promissory notes issue and wish him the best in that respect.  To listen to several members of Fianna Fáil - essentially all the speakers prior to the previous one - talk about the urgent need to renegotiate the promissory notes and that action must be taken now, when that party so recently landed the country with the promissory notes as they currently exist, is the height of hypocrisy.  The Minister spoke about the importance of this renegotiation long before it became popular in the mainstream media and I wish him well in that regard.  I echo some of the sentiments expressed earlier about the possibility that it would include not only interest rates and the terms but the capital amount and the possibility that some negotiated settlement can be reached in that regard.  I am not sure if that is feasible but it is that towards which we should negotiate.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I listened in almost disbelief to the previous Fianna Fáil speaker speak of the necessity for an agreement across Europe for a write-down of all of the banking debt.  These are the people who made a political decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank, which effectively was the bank of their friends and cronies, and landed a significant amount of debt onto the shoulders of the Irish people.  I cannot let that comment be made by that Member in this House without challenging the hypocrisy of it.  I do not know if Deputy Fleming was using the royal "we" when he spoke about the debts we ran up and how we ran them up on the basis of paying doctors and nurses.  His party ran them up on the basis of winning elections and buying people's votes and perhaps that is what he was trying to get at in the point he was making.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">It is worth pointing out that in respect of the difficult decisions the Minister has had to take since he assumed office, we have heard as recently as last week the ESRI state that the Government is on target for its budget deficit targets for the end of the year.  Last year it exceeded those targets and that has a real impact on people's lives.  Often politicians and members of Government lecture households and businesses on the need to balance their books and that is why I particularly support the stability treaty.  Twice in my lifetime, once when I was very young in the late 1970s and now in more recent times, the Fianna Fáil Party has broke the country by ramping up public expenditure on the back of election promises and gimmicks.  The stability treaty is to be supported because it will not allow it, in whatever incarnation it takes in the future, to do that ever again.  For that reason the treaty is to be welcomed.  I fully support the Minister and his officials in the difficult task of trying to negotiate a better deal than the deal Fianna Fáil left for them as they go about their business in the European Union.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOReilly" eId="spk_405">
          <from>Deputy Joe O’Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_715">I support the legislation which essentially gives effect to a second bailout for Greece.  I do so in solidarity with the Greek people and our euro partners.  It is important that we do that while recognising the suffering of the Greek people.  This measure will facilitate €130 million additional funds being made available to Greece, it will allow for the Greek private sector to take a 53.5% write down of its debt, a longer grace period of up to ten years for paying back the loan principal and a lengthening of the maturities of the loans to 15 years.  It will mean the interest we will receive from Greece will be reduced by €5.2 million annually but this is not significant in terms of this exercise in solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">It must be borne in mind that we benefited from a €9 billion reduction in our debt through the reduction of interest rates.  It is in the context of that reduction and the saving of the €9 billion that I pay a warm tribute to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, for the way he has built up confidence in this country among our euro partners within the enlarged EU and at an international level generally, which will have implications for inward investment.  That €9 billion saving is a derivative from that confidence building.  Similarly other benefits will accrue from it.  I wish him and the people around him well in the renegotiation of the promissory notes in terms of the implementation of the payment patterns.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I could not adequately endorse the words of my colleague, Deputy Phelan, regarding the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil on this issue and its failure to publicly admit on each occasion its members speak that the entire issue has its origins in its profligacy, mismanagement and viewing of the national finances as an election slush fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">We should note the suffering of the Greek people.  Rather than engage in triumphalistic talk about us thankfully being in a better position than Greece, we should acknowledge the pain they have gone through and the huge sacrifices they have been making.  I had the privilege of meeting Greek parliamentarians through my membership of the Council of Europe and I have anecdotal evidence to support that but they have suffered a great deal.  It is an arguable thesis that they may not have been as fit or as well prepared initially as other countries for entry into the eurozone, and they did have structural difficulties but that makes their achievements and the pain they are enduring all the greater.  It is in that spirit we should address the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">We should not only pass this Bill before the House but endorse with enthusiasm the fiscal compact treaty and the referendum thereon.  It is very important that we do that.  Our membership of and access to the European Stability Mechanism will act as a safety valve for us.  We do not aspire to a further bailout, which we are hoping to avoid, but the ESM will act as a security net for us in that it will make it easier for us to borrow on the open markets in the future because of the realisation that we have a fall-back position.  It will also facilitate and provide confidence for inward investment.  Were we not to pass the referendum we would not be as attractive as a window into Europe or as an English-speaking country into the eurozone.  It is important that we support it from that perspective and from the perspective of organising an effective job stimulus which is allowed within the fiscal compact treaty, despite Opposition attempts to portray it as an austerity measure.  It will bring only best budgetary practice into place.  It will allow expenditure. We will not be affected by its terms while we remain under the EU-IMF programme, but it will allow expenditure for job creation projects and constructive economic activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">I endorse the legislation.  I believe it is another sign of us, as a mature Parliament, taking our place within the eurozone.  I think we will go from strength to strength and all the indications are that we will do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterMathews" eId="spk_406">
          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews</from>
          <p eId="para_721">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Greece needs the support of all the members of the eurozone.  This Bill seeks to support the legislation which will achieve the second Greek bailout.   However, we must consider what has happened in the past 18 months.  It is as if a storm cloud has gathered over what is normally the sunny parts of Europe and the Mediterranean.  As Deputy O'Reilly pointed out, the pain and suffering in Greece is enormous.  It is not true, as sometimes has been suggested in low tones, that the Greeks did not face up to their responsibilities.  Greek expenditure has been slashed by one third.  For every €3 million Greece was spending before the crisis became chronic, it is now only spending €2 million.  These cuts are twice as high as the cuts in Ireland, five times higher than the cuts in Portugal, eight times higher than the cuts in Spain and 17 times higher than the cuts in Italy.  This is severe and it suggests where the dominant political countries of Europe have been making the formulas for recovery and for rehabilitation.  There is a slight ring of the word "reparations" because the Greeks overspent, did not work and indulged.  That is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Helmut Kohl, one of the really outstanding leaders of Europe some years ago, only last Tuesday week pointed out that the so-called evil spirits had not totally gone away.  He said that hand wringing and petty politicking should be set aside and that leadership of stature was now required.  I agree with that.  While we look at fiscal adjustments and fiscal architecture for the years ahead, there is now a huge debt burden that is patently unsustainable across the eurozone, and particularly in Ireland.  I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform where statistics showed the increased levels of household debt, non-financial corporate debt and national debt.  Our national debt is growing as we have to attend to paying out on foot of the promissory note.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I would like to make one last point.  There is a misunderstanding about this promissory note construct.  Under the euro system rules, which apply to the ECB and to the central banks under its umbrella, there is a prohibition against lending to any institutions that are deemed to be insolvent or approaching insolvency.  In order to redeem the bondholders in the busted banks, namely, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, and because the loan losses had not been estimated at that stage, there had to be a manufacture or construct of the promissory notes to give the viability of those institutions some substance.  However, the lending was provided by our Central Bank and the ECB to those institutions which enabled them to redeem the bonds in full.  Therefore, that is where the problem lies and tomorrow we hope the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, will insist yet again that the restructuring of that creditor obligation to the Central Bank of Ireland under the euro system can be written down in order that the promissory notes on the other side can be extinguished rather than restructured.  If they are only restructured, the liability still remains.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_727">I will need at least a two minute warning.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The Government has sadly parroted the lie that this programme for Greece is a bailout or some kind of act of solidarity with or assistance to the Greek people.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This programme for Greece is purely and simply a bailout for the banks and the bondholders in Greece and across Europe who turned the European economy into a gambling casino.  They caused the crisis, but ordinary Greek people are being asked to pay the price with the most savage austerity.  We need to be absolutely clear.  This is not an act of solidarity.  It is not a bailout.  It is a crucifixion of the Greek people and a robbery of their state assets, state enterprises and natural resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The proof of these assertions is that the loans being given to Greece are not even being given to the Greek Government or state and they are most certainly not being given to the Greek people.  They are being put into a special account which is not controlled by the elected representatives of the Greek people and has as its priority the repayment of the gambling debts of the bankers and the bondholders.  That is what it is about.  Who pays for that?  The Greek people pay for it with the most destructive, barbaric austerity measures imaginable.  The consequences have been absolutely devastating for the Greek people.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">One in five Greek people is now unemployed.  Fifty per cent of Greek youth are unemployed.  There are 22,000 people homeless in Athens alone.  An estimated one quarter of the population are dependent on soup kitchens and charity and voluntary organisations to eat.  A huge proportion of the population is not even eating every day.  Virtually every state asset, enterprise and natural resource is up for sale.  Greece's assets are literally being stripped away.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">Has this resulted in any improvement in the economic fortunes of Greece?  No.  It has led to a devastating collapse of the Greek economy.  It contracted by 7% last year and it is estimated to contract again by 7% this year.  That makes a complete mockery of all the targets of the so-called programme.  The Government often suggests that we live in fantasy land on this side of the House.  The Government and other EU leaders are living in fantasy land if they think that Greece will be able to reach the debt to GDP ratio of 120%, given the collapse of the Greek economy.  Their entire programme is based on renewed growth in the Greek economy.  They must be living in cloud-cuckoo-land if they think that the Greek economy can grow under the conditions being imposed on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">All the evidence has shown that the Greek economy is collapsing and that the collapse will continue.  Therefore, it will miss its targets and its debt-to-GDP ratio will almost certainly rise.  Even a couple of percentage points off the mark on the growth projections would mean that their debt-to-GDP ratio could go as high as 160% or 170%.  After all this suffering, asset stripping, the imposition of brutal austerity and suicide and poverty rates having gone through the roof, the end result is that the Greek economy will be in a far worse position than it was before this programme began.  Of course, that should not surprise us because that was the consequence of the first so-called Greek bailout.  They cut jobs, they cut pay and incomes, they cut social welfare and they privatised state assets, and the position got worse.  That is why they were unable to meet the targets of the first programme, why they were forced into a second bailout and why the austerity demands put on Greece were ratcheted up to an even greater and more intense degree.  That is the working out of this insane logic of austerity being imposed on the Greek people.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">The only bright spark in the Greek picture is the tremendous resistance of the Greek people, who are making it extremely difficult for the troika and their Government to impose this austerity on them.  Massive demonstrations, strikes and protests have physically prevented some of the austerity being imposed.  The popularity of the parties in Greece which have imposed this - the Government should watch this space - has collapsed such that the political parties of the left of the sort which oppose this austerity agenda in this country are now up to 40%.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The response to the dramatic collapse in support for the pro-austerity parties in Greece and the dramatic rise in support for those who oppose the austerity of, for example, the German Finance Minister, Mr. Wolfgang Schäuble, is that perhaps we should call off the elections that are due in a few months, and that really sums it up.  This austerity is rammed down people's throats, poverty, destitution and suicide increase and the country is asset stripped, and when the people revolt against it and threaten to put in power a different Government that will not go along with the austerity agenda, the EU masters state we should consider calling off the elections.  That just about sums up the trajectory of the austerity that is being rammed down the throats of the people of Greece and, increasingly, of the people across Europe.  It is a devastation of society and the economy and a subversion of democracy to ensure they can carry it all through.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">The important point to make about what is happening in Greece is that it is not by any means an isolated phenomenon.  It is living in fantasy land if the Government consoles itself with some notion that we are not Greece.  All that is stopping Ireland being in the same appalling position as Greece is that approximately 150,000 people have left this country in the past two years.  That is all that is saving the Government.  Otherwise we would be at similar levels of unemployment and social destitution as Greece.  However, when we are forced into a second bailout programme because we will still not be able to access borrowing on the international markets given the fact that we have taken on the bankers' gambling debts, the same intensification of austerity demands that has been imposed on Greece as part of the second so-called bailout will then come visiting these shores, and then even the escape channel of emigration will not save the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">All the people of this country need to learn from Greece, or for that matter, increasingly, from Portugal and Italy, and clearly the Government will not learn it, is how to protest, how to get out on the streets and resist this madness because this juggernaut is devastating our society.  All the signs are there: 14% or 15% unemployment, rising suicide rates, rising child poverty, hospitals or services being closed, just like in Greece, and more austerity promised year on year until we go into the second bailout when it will be intensified.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">We must stop this madness, and one opportunity for the public to do that will be on the 31st of this month when the Government plans to hand over another €3 billion to the toxic Irish Bank Resolution Corporation.  I believe Fine Gael is also holding its conference on that day.  There will be a massive demonstration in Dublin, from Parnell Square at 1p.m., and I hope we will see thousands, if not tens of thousands, taking Greece lessons in how to protest on that day.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">There is a real desire, right across Europe and in this country, for certainty and stability.  That is understandable because there have been several years of near chaos.  The word "bailout" tends to suggest something positive.  If I was getting a bailout from someone, I would expect to feel better about it and that it would lead to something more sustainable.  When one looks at the numbers, that is not what is happening here.  The numbers are impossible.  The people are reaching to turn off the television.  They have stopped buying newspapers.  They want to switch off from the bad news.  However, we must look at the numbers, at what underpins what is being proposed and at the vision that might be behind it.  What worries me is there is no hope in this for people in Greece and there is no group of people more dangerous than one which has nothing to lose.  As I say, the numbers will tell us everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The current Greek sovereign debt is in the order of €325 billion.  The agreement reached, which depends on buy-in by Thursday from those who hold Greek Government bonds, involves an acceptance of a 53% haircut.  From bonds worth roughly €206 billion, the haircut will be approximately €100 billion.  Theoretically, that is supposed to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio from 163% in 2011 to 120% by 2020, but that will only happen if there are other developments in the economy such as growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">One positive aspect, if one is looking for positives in such an awful situation, is that there is an acceptance that the banks and the bondholders should accept a write-down.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, dared suggest that when in some part of the United States, he was quickly rebuked by the European Central Bank, which stated that could not be done.  If there is a positive in it, it is that it certainly shows that it can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">This will be put across as if it were positive because Greece can remain inside the eurozone, but I would ask the question, for how long?  I looked at some of the numbers.  If one puts them on a table, one can ask what this means.  The population of Greece is approximately 10 million.  They have roughly the same GDP as ourselves.  Obviously, their debt is slightly different in that there is a bigger sovereign debt and less personal debt.  However, when one starts looking at the numbers, they go right to 2026, when the last payment would be made.  In 2021, for example, they must make the following quarterly payments: €2.3 billion, €2.6 billion, €2.6 billion and €2.6 billion.  That is set out, right up to 2026.  When one begins to realise the scale of this, given one was already at the point of cutting into bone, the figures are phenomenal.  The timeframe does not allow for inflation to make the kind of dent that would be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">Theoretically, this so-called bailout stops contagion in countries like Ireland, Italy and Portugal, and in practice it reduces the overall burden of debt on Greece.  However, it must be asked what kind of a country there will be and what kind of a Europe this is.  Where is the community method, the social solidarity or the Charter of Fundamental Rights?  The only thing we seem to talk about when talking about Europe is the money markets.  There is a huge population in Europe.  When do we begin to talk about the people of Europe and the vision for the kind of Europe to which we want to belong?  This has to be talked about in the context of how we lead countries to recovery.  There must be hope, but hope is not a long-term emotion.  It has to be within the sight of people because it is very dangerous not to have hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">An astonishing level of debt servicing will go with this so-called bailout.  It is clear that no longer can one country take on board the responsibility for the banking system.  We have to get to a point where there is a united approach and where we get to some measure like eurobonds in order that countries are not exposed in the way many have been.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I go back to the question of the Lisbon treaty and this whole intergovernmental approach.  Intergovernmentalism is not necessarily a bad thing but the particular approach taken here flies in the face of what was proposed in the Lisbon treaty, where it was suggested that, instead of the two or three strong countries dictating, it would be possible to have a consolidation of smaller countries that would together wield a power that would at least not expose them in the way this intergovernmentalism is exposing them.  Obviously, that refers to the fiscal compact.  This approach is very one dimensional.  It refers only to the financial side of things whereas Europe was supposed to be about so much more than just the financial side.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Many left-wing parties bought into the European constitution through the Lisbon treaty because it had the European social charter, where civic, political and economic rights were afforded.  They might as well forget about that.  In that context, one would have to ask what exactly the project is here.  There is a very definite politics underpinning it, and a very conservative, Christian democratic axis driving it, without reference to the weaker people within societies.  It involves issues such as being able to afford schooling for children, supports for people who are sick and pensions for those who have gone past their working life.  These are issues one would not expect to see in a modern society such as that of Greece.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The numbers tell us that we are looking here not at saving the euro or giving the kind of certainty we all would like.  Instead, we are looking at postponing a problem and we are looking at conflict.  If people are not given hope, there is nothing surer than there will be some sort of response.  We have already seen some of that response but it is not the response I want to see.  I want to see people saying we can work our way out of this situation.  However, what is happening in regard to what is on the table for Greece will not be a solution that puts hope into the equation in anything like an acceptable timeframe.  We are storing up terribly serious problems in a continent that knows what conflict is about, given two world wars have started from it.  We had better keep our eye on the bigger picture, namely, why the European Union was founded in the first place.  I have real fears about what is being proposed.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">The purpose of the Bill is to provide further financial stability in the interest of the public, the European Union and the safeguarding of the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.  Members will notice that it is in the interest of the public, not in the interest of one particular party.  It seems that some in this Chamber do not understand the importance of financial stability and are willing to run the gauntlet on this matter, or they do not comprehend the implications of financial chaos.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">The Greeks are a proud people and, as we are unfortunately well aware in Ireland, it is a very sad day when a nation loses control of its economic sovereignty to the troika, a lender of last resort, due to reckless fiscal planning by previous governments.  However, the sovereign debt levels in Greece got to a point from which there was no returning without external aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The rationale of the lending facilities within the euro area is to counteract the unsustainable fiscal policies that were being implemented by governments within Europe and the ECB.  As a Labour Party member, I resent having to push through very painful spending cuts, which can push economies into recession, without counteracting growth agendas.  The euro area loan facilities are in place to counteract the huge rise in the cost of borrowing that these countries faced recently and to ensure wages and services are not slashed or cut off overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">As we all know, Greece's national debt-to-GDP ratio was as high as 160% recently.  Its borrowing costs were unsustainable and, following lengthy negotiations, another bailout for Greece was agreed recently as €14.5 billion of Greek bonds were about to expire.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">What went wrong in Greece?  Some of this story may sound familiar.  Upon joining the euro, it became easier for the country to borrow money.  Greece went on a debt-funded spending spree, including paying for high-profile projects such as the 2004 Athens Olympics, which went well over budget.  The country was hit by the downturn, which meant it had to spend more on benefits and received less in taxes.  There were also doubts about the accuracy of its economic statistics.  Greece's economic problems meant lenders started charging higher interest rates to lend it money.  Widespread tax evasion also hit the Government's coffers, as has been well documented throughout.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Spring</from>
          <p eId="para_755">I told the Deputy it would sound familiar.  Greece has won a 53.5% reduction in its debt burden to private creditors, while any profits made by eurozone central banks on their holdings of Greek debt will be channelled back to Greece.  It has secured a second bailout worth €130 billion and, in return, its lenders have attached strict conditions to the loan.  This new bailout requires that the Greek Government considers by 2015 whether the position of 150,000 public sectors workers is sustainable.  This is the gravity of the situation the Greeks are left with.  As an Irishman, I am proud we are tackling the eye of the storm without having to go down the same road.  I accept there will be further negative implications for Greece, which is unfortunate.  As previous speakers pointed out, this measure is not enough.  We must have a growth pact and the ECB must acknowledge this.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">There is an element which proves that, as a Continent, we acknowledge the problems among us.  Among the rich, the poor, programme countries and non-programme countries, there is a generation of people whom I call the jinxed generation - the young people of Spain, Greece, Ireland, and the migrants to whom previous speakers referred.  They must be given the capacity to develop a substantial standard of living.  I constantly refer to the need for quantitative easing.  We know what austerity is, but we must have growth.  There must be more co-operation throughout Europe.  The idea that conflict is far away is nonsense given that a German flag has been burnt in Greece.  It shows that people are at the end of their tether.  We will take this step, which I welcome, because we are helping the Greek people.  I truly believe that.  However, a great deal more must be done not only for Greece but for the Continent also.</p>

        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_757">I support the legislation which is aimed at the financial stability of Europe.  It is not just Greece; it is this country and all of the other countries in Europe.  This is the second Greek bailout, bringing it to an eye-watering €240 billion.  Our contribution is small enough but it is a considerable sum given our domestic circumstances.  However, it is correct that we show solidarity with our partners in Europe, in particular as we expect the same from them.  It is encouraging that one aspect of the package is the troika's willingness to retrospectively reduce interest rates, which can bring down the debt burden for countries, not just for Greece but for other countries such as this one with high debt levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The entire package for Greece, the debt write-down, the restructuring of bond maturity, interest rate reductions and a direct cash transfer has, just by the promise of it, settled markets.  I hope it will help Greece survive at least temporarily because settling markets is vital to their interests, our interests and to the interests of the entire European Union.  It should be the focus of all our endeavours.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">To be honest, however, I do not have great confidence that it will be a long-term solution to Greek woes as their problems are enormous with debt to GDP ratios of 168%.  Even with the most imaginative financial gymnastics and the most optimistic assumptions no one can quite make Greece's debt to GDP forecasts reach 120% by 2020.  A ratio of 120% for debt to GDP is regarded as sustainable only in efficient and growing economies.  I am afraid Greece is neither of those.  It is a country of the most unwelcome superlatives.  It is receiving the world's largest ever financial restructuring deal.  It has the largest balance of payments in the industrialised world as a share of GDP.  It is less competitive than Rwanda and Namibia.  Now there is also political uncertainty in Greece at a time when it is least needed.  All of that has the potential to be serious trouble for the future of Greece but also for the future of Europe, in particular for peripheral countries such as this one and others with ailing economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Greece is in the unhappy position where neither austerity nor a stimulus package can work because of the total inflexibility of its economy and the absence of public support for the kind of change and the quantum of change that is needed.  There are lessons for those in this country who resist change.  Unlike in this country, despite the grave position in Greece, prices there have not fallen significantly.  That is largely due to inflexible wage rates and practices.  For instance, the price of houses, which as we know has fallen by 50% in this country, has fallen by only approximately 13% in Greece.  Labour costs have risen in the past decade by 35% compared to 2% in Germany which has killed its tourism industry on which it is totally dependent.  Greece remains uncompetitive and it continues to import more than it exports and, as other speakers have said, its economy continues to contract.  Without structural reform to drive down costs the economy cannot grow and Greece's debt will remain stubbornly high.  It is not austerity alone that is causing that; it is the inflexibility of the economy and the resistance to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">A stimulus package for Greece now would be a waste of money because it would feed into higher wages rather than growth.  Everyone in Europe knows that.  Investors know it.  The troika knows it.  The eurozone countries know it.  The European Union has done the unthinkable - the thing it said it would never do - it wrote down debt.  It went further; it legislated to prevent the write-down of the replacement debt in Greece.  That leaves Greece with nowhere to go.  It cannot write down further debt.  No private investor is willing to lend to Greece and now the appetite in Europe for further bailout is lessening by the day.  I do not know where Greece can turn for further bailouts. It has been almost conceded, if not publicly, that Greece may well exit the euro before very long.  The lesson for this country is that it must strengthen our resolve to sort out our finances and restructure the economy so that if the worst does happen to Greece we are not so vulnerable that we are caught in the maelstrom of the contagion that will undoubtedly follow.</p>

        <speech by="#JimDaly" eId="spk_418">
          <from>Deputy Jim Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_762">It is an interesting debate with many angles but one must look at the bigger picture and view everything in a European context.  For the past 30 years we no longer have the luxury of discussing countries on their own and examining their individual merits and attributes.  We must see the bigger picture.  I was in Brussels at the beginning of last week.  One of the interesting things I learned there is that it is not possible for Greece to exit the euro without exiting the Union.  The scenario of breaking up the Union bit by bit is a scary one and one that cannot be lightly contemplated.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Many are complaining about the austerity that is being implemented in this country and how we have, collectively, as a nation reduced our living standards.  Comparatively, we are in or around the standards we enjoyed in 2005.  One can only imagine what we would have to return to if we were to take the Union apart, forgo the currency and return to the living standard we enjoyed in the 1980s.  What we would have to do is unimaginable.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">A total of 23 million people are unemployed across the Union.  Unemployment is the single greatest threat to the European Union.  It was interesting to hear our colleague members of other parliaments compare their experiences.  Our Spanish counterparts have 5.3 million people unemployed, which is almost a quarter of the workforce.  Up to 60% of people under the age of 25 years are unemployed in certain regions and the rate is 40% and 50% in other regions.  There is no doubt the issues and the challenges they present are stark.  Without a shadow of doubt, unemployment is the single greatest challenge we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">It was also interesting the note the divide in ideas and ideologies in Europe.  In particular, I noticed that our colleagues in Britain are divided among themselves on the approach the EU should take on the future of the Union, the currency and on the future of Greece.  The experience provided much opportunity for learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">One of the solutions proposed was obvious, namely, that while there are 23 million people unemployed there are 23 million small to medium enterprises in the European Union and if each one of them was facilitated to create one single job it would provide a solution to the unemployment crisis.  One could ask how we would go about that.  It is important that with a 10% budgetary deficit and 190% debt, we have strong trading partners surrounding us in the Union.  It is important for our viability and future that there is strong Union.  That is why the debate brings a focus to the Greek situation but it also introduces the bigger picture of stability across the Union if we are to trade our way out of the current difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">In bringing growth we must also deal with austerity.  I said previously that austerity is not a dirty word; it is not a word that should have negative connotations.  Austerity is merely cutting one's cloth according to one's measure.  It is a pity we did not have austerity in this country in the decade preceding this one.  Austerity is needed across Europe.  People must stay within budget and deal with deficits, which has absolutely nothing to do with the banking debt.  It is a question of bridging our income and expenditure on an annual basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_768">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill, the purpose of which is not simply to bail out Greece.  It is also in the interests of the Irish economy by ensuring the financial stability of the European Union and safeguarding the financial stability of the euro as a whole.  It is in all our interests to support Greece because we have been supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">I disagree with Deputy Catherine Murphy's view that the Bill provides no hope.  It provides much hope, in particular to the people of Greece, this country and Spain, as we have found ourselves in serious difficulties in recent years for a variety of reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Without measures like this, we would have no hope.  It is the responsibility of every euro country to provide hope for those countries in difficulty.  In strengthening the crises tools within the euro area we will make further progress in integrating economic and fiscal policies and reinforcing co-ordination, surveillance and discipline which, sadly, was lacking in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">It is evident from the troika's report of October 2011 that the Greek economy is in deep recession.  Greece will not be able to sustain recovery without official debt relief.  Ireland has benefited from a €9 billion reduction in the interest costs associated with its borrowings from EU sources.  The German Chancellor, Dr. Merkel, stated in 2011 that Ireland had not only met but surpassed its deficit targets, had carried out important reforms, particularly in the financial sector, and that, on foot of rising competitiveness, investors were returning to Ireland, which was welcome.  In the true spirit of the European Union it is not only equitable but fair that Greece receive similar assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The new Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Lucas Papademos, is a breadth of fresh air and a steadying force in favour of a rational approach to the enormous problems facing his country and its people.  Greece has taken decisive and swift legislative action in the area of fiscal consolidation, revenue administration, pension reform, financial sector regulation and supervision and growth enhancement of structural reforms.  In the spirit of solidarity with our Greek colleagues, I support the Bill which will assist a country in serious difficulty.  It will be a long and painful process, but there is no other palatable alternative, politically or socially, for Greece.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The purpose of the Bill is to further facilitate, in the public interest, the financial stability of the European Union and the safeguarding of the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.  In supporting Greece we are also supporting the recovery of the eurozone and the Irish economy, something of which Members on all sides should be supportive.</p>

          <p eId="para_774">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  In discussing the Bill and agreeing to an additional bailout programme for Greece we are showing our solidarity with the Greek people.  It is extremely important that Greece, like Ireland, meet its requirements under the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">In the limited time available to me I would like to touch on Ireland's solidarity with its European partners.  It is stated in media reports that the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, is attending a meeting of the ECB Governing Council in Frankfurt today.  What we need is solidarity from the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the EFSF.  We also need flexibility, in particular from the ECB which of late has shown a degree of flexibility not seen heretofore by way of the provision of €1 trillion in funding for three years at a rate of 1% to the banking system, in respect of which banks can bid on an unlimited basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">We need flexibility on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note for a number of reasons.  The promissory note, in terms of construct, wa artificial.  Interest was set at the prohibitive rate of 8%, which has had a major effect on our budgetary position on an annual basis and debt levels.  If we are given flexibility in this area, particularly by our European partners and the ECB, we will be in a position to meet our 8.6% deficit to GDP target for the current year and our deficit to GDP targets in future years.  We would also save approximately €1.9 billion in interest charges, which would have a positive impact on our day-to-day expenditure and benefit the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The Anglo Irish Bank promissory note needs to be restructured.  The Government is in negotiations with the troika in this regard.  It is important that sufficient time is provided to get this right.  In the meantime, deferral of the €3.1 billion due on the promissory note at the end of this month should be facilitated by the ECB, the European Commission, the EFSF and our EU partners.  This deferral could be accommodated by way of Government bonds or an additional promissory note.  Sufficient time must be provided to allow the troika consider how best to restructure the promissory note, thus ensuring the burden on the general public and Irish taxpayer is reduced and our recovery continues.  What is good for Ireland is good for the European Union.  It must be made clear to our European partners that a restructuring of the promissory note and, in the event of a conclusion not being reached by the troika, deferral of the payment of €3.1 billion due at the end of this month would benefit Ireland and the European Union, as we are in this together.  This is all about solidarity which we are showing today for Greece.  We need continued solidarity throughout the European Union.  I wish the Government and Professor Honohan well in their discussions on the restructuring of the promissory note.</p>

          <p eId="para_780">It is welcome that there has been a move towards a significant write-down of the debts the Greek people are being asked to repay.  It is true that serious structural reforms are needed in Greece and that the Greek Government needs to modernise several of its national institutions, particularly its tax collection service.  It is also true that Greece has unsustainable practices in some sectors, including its low retirement age relative to that in other European countries.  However, we must be cognisant of the extraordinary social pain the Greek people are being asked to endure to secure these write-downs.  Every day we hear stories of pension funds being wiped out, hospitals being unable to afford life savings drugs and workers in the public and private sectors taking enormous pay cuts.  I have heard that doctors are taking pay cuts of 80%.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">It is clear that the Greek people are being asked to endure a level of austerity which no one else would accept.  I do not believe we would accept it or that the German, French, Italian or Spanish people would accept it.  In this context, we need to be aware of the arrogance and condescension in our tone when speaking about Greece.  One often hears on radio that Greece is a dysfunctional society, that Greek people are lazy and will not work long hours and so on.  I recently read a piece of research that the average working week in Greece was significantly longer than in Germany.  I am sure other Deputies have, like me, noted the tone of arrogance and condescension of people in Ireland and across Europe when speaking about Greece.  We need some humility in Ireland - we have made a lot of mistakes - and throughout Europe.  Some of the commentary I have heard from senior European officials has been condescending.  I note it comes from those same officials who are making mistakes year after year that are driving the European crisis from bad to worse.  Consequently, a little humility would be in order for everyone.  I will support this Bill because the Greek people need this significant write-down.  However, I do not believe it will not be enough as it will reduce their debt from 160% to approximately 120% of GDP and, therefore, the Greek people will be back for a third write-down, this being their second major write-down.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">This Parliament and the Irish people can learn from what is going on in Greece and can learn a thing or two from the Greek Government.  Whenever I suggest in this Chamber that Ireland could learn a thing or two from Greece because, unlike Ireland, it has managed to secure write-downs and has managed to bring bondholders voluntarily to the table to take write-downs of between 70% and 75%, members of the Government throw their arms in the air and state that I want Ireland to be Greece, want the hospitals to be closed down and wish for riots in the streets.  Of course I do not and it is nonsense to suggest that I or anyone else does.  An analogy that occurs to me is that of a man who is sitting at home, having let himself get out of shape.  He has put on a lot of weight and has not been exercising.  He then looks out the window and sees his neighbour who is in even worse shape but who has decided to go out jogging.  Sweat is pouring off the neighbour and he is in a great deal of pain but while he wishes he was not obliged to jog to get fit, he is doing it anyway.  The man sitting at home thinks he could learn a thing or two from that guy and that perhaps he needs to go jogging, only for someone else to tell him that is ridiculous because he then would end up like his neighbour.  That is how I consider the response given whenever I suggest there is something we could learn from Greece.  The response is Ireland could not possibly do so and that I want Ireland to become like Greece when, obviously, I do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">There are some serious lessons Ireland can learn from Greece.  One is that senior bondholders voluntarily will take write-downs of 75% in their bonds.  Another is that other private sector investors will take massive write-downs in sovereign debt once they accept the ability of the country in question to pay them back the full amount of that debt is gone.  If one applies this lesson to Ireland, I note that next year our debt will hit approximately 120% of GDP.  Depending on who one believes, unsustainable national debt kicks in somewhere between 90% and 120% of GDP.  The argument with Greece is easier as its debt is at 160% of GDP and no one is suggesting the Greeks ever will be able to pay down that quantum of debt without having their own currency, quantitative easing and so on.  My assertion is that for Ireland, a debt level of 120% of GDP is unsustainable.  It is right at the top end of what any commentator suggests can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Ireland has paid back most of the senior bondholders.  That argument has been fought and unfortunately it has been won by the bondholders and speculators.  I accept no Deputy in this House wanted to pay back the full amount to the bondholders.  When appearing on "The Frontline" television programme on Monday night, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, stated the Government made an explicit decision to pay the senior bondholders to try to get a massive write-down in respect of the promissory notes.  I wish the Government well in this regard, as there is a huge amount to play for and I hope it succeeds.  However, I keep hearing phrases from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to the effect that Ireland will pay its debts, is not seeking a write-down, has never sought a write-down and never will seek a write-down in its debt.  This is a perpetuation of a mistake made by Fianna Fáil in the previous Government, when Ireland paid the bondholders month after month.  The rationale people then were given was the Government was obliged to pay them or they would lock it out of the markets.  However, exactly the opposite is true.  They saw Ireland mounting up this debt, which consisted of other people's debts, and locked us out of the markets.  They decided not to lend Ireland any more money because it was trying to pay its own debt and everyone else's debt and therefore they certainly were not going to lend any more money to it.  My concern is the Government continues to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">When I hear the Taoiseach state that Ireland is not seeking and never will seek a write-down in the debt, there is a certain moral tone that states Ireland is a country that will pay its way.  I understand that, as everyone wishes to do so and no one wishes to look for a write-down in the debt.  However, this is not what the markets have been telling me.  I spent two days in London last week when I spoke to venture capitalists, specialist investors and bond traders, who are the people who buy and sell sovereign debt.  They told me they did not really care about the fiscal compact, as it did not make Ireland more or less attractive as a country to which to lend money.  They really only care about the total quantum of Ireland's debt and, because it stands at 120% of GDP, they will not lend Ireland any money.  Furthermore, they were perplexed that they keep hearing from our senior team, that is, from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, that under no circumstances will Ireland seek the one thing they, the people who actually buy and sell debt, believe we need.  These words matter.  When the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste state that under no circumstances will Ireland seek a write-down, it matters because it makes it more difficult for Ireland to get a write-down.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, declared in the New York Stock Exchange that Ireland would not pay the senior Anglo Irish Bank bondholders all of their money, it mattered and the senior debt dropped dramatically on the markets immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">As for what Ireland can learn from our partners in Greece, we can learn that a pure austerity-based approach does not work.  When one does not have one's own currency, does not seek a write-down and enforces austerity while hoping for growth, it does not work.  Economic history shows this does not work.  Moreover, when one's debt is unsustainable and one names it as being such, it matters and it brings people to the table.  Furthermore, attempting to pay debts at a level of 120% of GDP will condemn Ireland to a decade or more of increasing economic and social pain.  Earlier today, a Government Deputy mentioned that he did not want to see a return to the conditions that obtained in the 1980s.  Unfortunately, that is precisely what is happening and the social indicators are moving backwards.  I have learned from the Greek situation that there is nothing shameful about seeking a reduction in the debt.  It is not immoral and is not selfish.  It is prudent, is good economics and is good finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Ireland has paid in excess of €60 billion to a bunch of people to whom it did not owe the money and consequently, its debt will hit approximately €200 billion next year.  I believe a €60 billion reduction in that debt probably would mean we still were in the markets and the troika would never have been here.  There is a very strong argument for naming our debt as being unsustainable.  There is an argument for learning from the Greeks by telling Europe and those in the private sector who hold Ireland's debt that while we cannot manage 120%, we want to help them and will negotiate.  Ireland should then try to get the debt down to a level at which the markets consider it to be low enough to again lend to this country at reasonable rates and then, we can begin to invest.  While I believe we must cut the deficit as fast as we can, we must have real stimulus, which we are missing.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I support the Bill and will vote for it.  I wish our colleagues in Greece the very best and call on the Government to learn a thing or two about what can happen if one changes the narrative in respect of getting a write-down.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_424">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_789">This Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill has led to an interesting debate in this House.  As it is related to Europe, unlike most other Bills no amendments can be tabled.  There is no debate about the detail of the Bill and it is not being dealt with section by section to ascertain what can or should be changed or what is required.  The Government has portrayed this Bill as being required simply as a measure of support for the Greek people and as a measure to reinforce Ireland's solidarity with them.  This is because there are no financial implications for Ireland in respect of this legislation because like the Greeks, we are in a bailout programme and therefore will not be required to contribute to this loan facility for them as envisaged under this legislation.  The debate on this Bill has developed into an interesting discussion that has given Members an opportunity to discuss the Greek situation, make comparisons with our own position and tease out ideas in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">The Greek situation is very interesting.  Like Ireland, Greece is a former colony and for many years the Greeks were subject to a colonial power.  In their case, they were under the Ottoman Empire, while Ireland was under the British Empire.  Thereafter, they suffered under dictatorship for many years until finally in 1974, Greece became a democracy.  Many of the problems with the Greek economy stem from that time.  When a country is being run by a colonial power or a dictatorship, people indicate their opposition - there is still an element of this in Ireland - by refusing to pay taxes.  They refuse to fund the entities responsible for keeping them down.  Such entities use the mechanisms by which they remain in power to punish either their colonial subjects or their own people, whichever is the case.  A culture has developed in Greece that the way to oppose those in power is to withhold one's taxes.  As a result, people do not see the payment of taxes as a way to contribute to the functioning of the state.  Neither do they perceive the payment of taxes as being essential in ensuring services will be provided for all citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">I read an article late last year in which it was indicated that in the first three months of 2011 in the city of Sparta which has a population of 40,000 only €24,000 was raised in VAT.  If one considers the position in Dundalk or any other town of similar size in Ireland, one will discover that many millions in VAT would be raised in such a period.  This underlines the problems in Greece, particularly in encouraging its people to accept that the duly elected government is theirs and that it is their state.  The Greeks must be encouraged to have a sense of ownership and belonging when they pay taxes and make their contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">I was interested to discover the extent of tax evasion in Greece.  I have seen evidence to the effect that in the region of €40 billion in tax goes unpaid each year.  In most cases, it is those in the professional classes who are avoiding paying tax.  There are stories which indicate that hospital consultants who live in the richest parts of Athens are declaring incomes of between €3,000 and €5,000 per year.  It is not that long ago that similar things were being done in this country.  All through the 1980s there was massive tax evasion on the part of the professional classes.  They used Ansbacher accounts, other offshore accounts and various tax-avoidance measures in order to avoid paying their dues.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">We should act in solidarity with the Greek people by helping them to develop a new taxation system in order that they might develop a sense of ownership of their state and feel they are contributing to it by paying tax.  If the Greek Government could target those who are not paying tax and collect the €40 billion in unpaid taxes to which I refer, it would solve many of the problems Greece faces.  However, we have seen fit to force on the Greek people further austerity and increased taxation.  Greece has a huge public sector and those who work in it pay their taxes.  Therefore, it is they who are suffering most as a result of the austerity programme.  We are also forcing on the Greeks a massive programme of privatisation.  I accept that they are getting a debt write-down which is welcome, but it remains to be seen whether this will actually come to pass.  There has been a slight fudge in the context of some of the money involved being made available and a deal has still not been concluded on private sector involvement in the write-down.  I hope this write-down will come to pass because it might be of some benefit to the Greeks in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">In the interests of solidarity, we should be assisting the Greek people and helping them to grow their economy and change their taxation system in order that they might collect the funds needed to run their state.  We should not be forcing them to sell off their assets, mineral rights, airports, ports and all those public sector companies which could generate income for the Greek state.  We should not be enforcing an ideologically-driven austerity programme which has been foisted upon us by Germany, France and, in view of David Cameron's comments in recent days, Britain.  The model being imposed is one the proponents of which believe the market is king and should be protected at all costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">In the context of the referendum on the fiscal compact treaty, Ireland is moving into territory where the ideology to which I refer is going to be enshrined in the Constitution.  It will also be enshrined in law in other European Union member states.  This ideology will tie us into austerity programmes and ensuring we will have balanced budgets forever more.  That runs contrary to the previous orthodoxy which held sway in economics, namely, that in a time of boom taxes should be increased, while spending should be increased in a time of decline.  Although we had boom and bust cycles, to a large extent, this approach worked for many years.  Forcing austerity on the peoples of Greece, Ireland and other states across Europe is to the detriment of democracy and will only benefit the European banking system and the leaders of France, Germany and Britain.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_426">
          <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
          <p eId="para_797">I will take five minutes and the remainder of the time can be divided among those who are due to follow me.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">I agree with Deputy Thomas Pringle that this has been an extremely interesting debate which has given Members the opportunity to discuss the various issues relating to both the economic situation across Europe and the fiscal compact treaty which we will, of course, be debating in the coming months.  It is important, however, to remind ourselves of what we are being asked to do in respect of the legislation before the House.  As the Minister pointed out and Members are aware, we are being asked to give our consent - nothing more - to the implementation of amendments to the Greek loan facility already in existence.  In saying this, I am not stating our consent is not worthy of consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">I am fundamentally of the view that this is an issue of solidarity and that this debate ought to centre on the necessity for and importance of solidarity expressed by Ireland to a fellow member state of the European Union and the eurozone.  I agree to a large extent with what Deputy Stephen Donnelly stated about the general approach which should be taken to this matter.  If I understood him correctly, he made the point that it was a pity that there appeared to be so much moralising taking place - there has been a certain amount of it in this debate - across Europe in respect of the situation in Greece and other countries.  The finger is being pointed at countries because they are supposed, as a result of some historic considerations, not to be able to manage their own affairs.  Countries are also being accused of acting in a profligate way at all times and it has been stated they do not understand financial or economic management.  In parts, Deputy Michael McGrath's contribution smacked of being a lecture.  Giving a lecture to the Greeks does not reflect, in any shape or form, where we stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">I do not believe people in this House or elsewhere should engage in arrogant posturing which, in some quarters, is becoming part of the debate on the situation in Greece.  Unfortunately, as Deputy Stephen Donnelly or another Member indicated, this attitude of finger-pointing is reflected at high levels throughout Europe.  It is fair to state the difficulties being experienced in Greece are attributable, perhaps in considerable part, to domestic developments.  However, they are also a feature of the crisis at the heart of the eurozone project and what happened during the past eight to ten years.  Very serious macroeconomic and other imbalances have emerged in Europe.  I am not making excuses for particular forms of conduct, whether in respect of the payment of taxes or otherwise, in certain countries.  The serious and major imbalances to which I refer have emerged at the very heart of the eurozone project and an attempt is being made - perhaps belatedly - to address them.  It is not, however, merely a case of wagging the finger of blame at one country simply because it seems to be the one which is in the eye of the storm.  I am not seeking to imply that reforms are not necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">The post-colonial comparative analysis in which Deputy Thomas Pringle engaged of the situation in Greece may have a great deal going for it.  The Deputy recounted the history of that country and referred to the reasons for  people's unwillingness to pay taxes, etc.  When he was speaking, I could not avoid thinking there might perhaps be a basis for believing there is an element of this in our own political culture and that we need to realise and understand - I do not wish to be accused of wagging the finger at anyone in this regard - that there is a need to pay for public services.  Public services must be paid for and there are not that many ways of doing this other than through the payment of taxes which sometimes include income or property taxes.  We should be clear that in order to provide public and local services, we may need to levy property taxes.  I wonder, however, if we have such support in all quarters.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">If I was abroad and looking at Ireland to judge its mood, I might look at the media if I was not Irish.  I might also talk to people I know.  Ultimately, however, I would look to the Parliament, as no matter what has been said, this Parliament is the democratically elected body which represents the people.  Members ranging from Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett to those on the Government side were elected by the people.  I would apply this to Greece when considering what has happened there.  I know people had to make a choice in that parliament between what was bad and what was catastrophic.  I watched events unfolding on television, but the Greek parliamentarians made a choice in their democratically elected parliament.  I remember watching politicians from my own European grouping some weeks ago, including a former finance Minister in the PASOK party whose name I cannot remember and which I probably could not pronounce.  He was practically in tears, but he understood the choice was between something terrible and something catastrophic.  Those politicians made the choice and are entitled to receive the solidarity of this House and the Irish people in what is being proposed.  People are entitled to vote as they choose, but I strongly urge Members to recognise that this is an issue of solidarity and support the Greek people at this time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</from>
          <p eId="para_805">The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, has joined us.  It is important to focus not just on the Bill but also on the issue of innovation, research and how we can, as an economic community, ride out the storm.  Deputy Alex White is correct; this is about giving consent and working in collaboration with our Greek neighbours and the European Union.  He is also correct that this is not about lecturing, pointing the finger or scoring political points but ensuring the European Union can learn from mistakes made and help our Greek neighbours in this case.  It is important that we look at the European Union as a partnership that works and which can benefit the Irish people.  Greece requires a write-down and is looking for assistance.  We did the same.  It is not about us being like Greece or the good boys of Europe; rather it is about solidarity and partnership in the Union.  It is not about Ms Merkel or Mr. Sarkozy being the top tier pointing the finger and waving a flag but about the European Union and the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">This is the only English-speaking country in the eurozone and although we are situated on the periphery of Europe, we have an ideal role to play in seeking the renaissance of the country.  It is important that we show leadership as democratically elected politicians.  That means we should realise the commentators, academics, economists and others with opinions and who like to pontificate are not all right and all wrong.  Those of us in government across the eurozone must make decisions to benefit the membership of the European Union.  This is about responsibility and duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Deputy Alex White spoke about the mood in Ireland.  If one goes canvassing, one will hear people saying times are tough and that the level of disposable income is not what it was; people have made sacrifices, but they expect and want those in government to deliver.  In its first full year the Government has been moving towards this goal, focusing on the creation of confidence in the country.  There are two elements to this, the first of which is foreign direct investment which, as the Minister of State knows from his work in the Department, is starting to arrive in droves.  It will lead to job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">There is also the question of restoring our reputation internationally.  It is important, therefore, that Ministers not just go on junkets for St. Patrick's Day celebrations but also try to sell the country, the workforce and particularly our educated young people and the skills set of the nation.  They should point out that we have brought stability and are focusing on growth and the creation of jobs.  International confidence requires a sound Government and the implementation of financial policies which will attract jobs and investment.  There is an example of this in my own city and county of Cork in the shape of Eli Lilly which involves an investment of €330 million and the creation of 220 jobs.  Considering what IDA Ireland achieved last year, one can see that the Government has brought stability and certainty and that it is delivering on job creation.  It is important for it to implement policies that will not damage confidence but will build on the progress made in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Deputy Stephen Donnelly spoke about the Government and the European issue, but within a period of 12 months the Government has renegotiated part of the EU debt settlement deal, worked with the troika and secured a reduction in the amount we must pay.  There is more to be done, but it is working towards this end.  It is important to realise that we are working with a troika.  We have lost our sovereignty and ability to determine by ourselves.  We must take steps to regain that sovereignty in order that we can go to the markets and be freed from the requirements of the EU-IMF-ECB deal.  It is important that European Union member states work together rather than be preoccupied with internal electoral contests or what is best for individual countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The upcoming referendum offers an opportunity to inform the people about what the treaty is about.  The challenge for those opposing the treaty is not to introduce the issue of septic tanks, the household charge or the local backyard project.  This is about what is best for Ireland and its people, not just today but in ten or 15 years time.  We can learn much from what happened at the RDS last week, not at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis but from the queues at the jobs fair.  The same is happening in Cork today.  We have people who want to work and have the opportunity to engage in the workforce.  We must face that issue as a reason the referendum is important.  It is important that we vote "Yes" to bring certainty to the issue.  It is vital that we have access to the European Stability Mechanism which will provide the certainty the markets require.  We must have confidence in order that there can be investment in job creation in Ireland.  Those opposing the treaty for ideological reasons should listen and ask what the people want.  The political landscape has changed and the leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Micheál Martin, has spoken about the end of the "Punch and Judy" show.  I welcome his support for the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">We require certainty and leadership, as does the European Union.  The peoples of Europe emerged from a dark era in the last century not once but twice.  In this century we can emerge from a period of economic darkness.  That is the challenge faced by all of us and it will require leadership to be shown.  Everybody must live up to that task.</p>

          <from>Deputy Nicky McFadden</from>
          <p eId="para_812">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill.  Strengthening the financial sector is a key part of restoring economic growth across the eurozone and ensuring long-term sustainability.  In receiving an extension of the terms of existing loans from euro states and €130 billion in funds Greece has a responsibility to implement the necessary policies that will stabilise its economy and boost growth and employment.  The agreement hopes to reduce its GDP by 40% and cut its national debt by up to €107 billion.  It is welcome that additional funding will be provided for the purposes of interest rate support and supporting the banking sector.  Tourism, in particular, has been the lifeblood of the country's economy.  It is important that the country generate other sources of finance and look to the export market and foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">I agree with Deputy Alex White that there should be no finger-pointing, as the Greek people are suffering.  My five most recent summer holidays were spent in Greece and I know they are a hard-working people.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">The loan agreement is not centred on Greece, as it has wider implications for the entire eurozone, Ireland included.  The same principles apply to Greece as to Ireland and every other eurozone country.  There must be a fair taxation system, a more efficient public service and an improvement in business conditions, while the availability of credit for small businesses is essential.  While stabilising finances is critical, if we really want to see the European Union progress and flourish in the future, reformation cannot be focused on financial matters alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">Since the financial crisis erupted a certain level of euroscepticism has been evident.  While mistakes were made, we must be sure not to disregard the very positive aspects of our membership of the European Union.  The bureaucratic nature of the eurozone and systems has made it particularly difficult for people to see these very positive aspects.  What is required is political and social reform to foster a natural sense of unity among member nations.  The relationship between European nations and interdependence can offer much in opening up markets and creating employment opportunities.  It is not a case of them versus us and should not be viewed as such.  It is in each country's interests that the other does well.  To achieve this, political and social reform is needed to make clear the objective of the European project.  This critical juncture is the perfect opportunity to examine the basis of the European Union and generate policies that will allow for greater political and cultural unity.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">The Bill is focused on securing the future financial stability of the European Union.  It offers an opportunity to eurozone nations to look to the future in a united way.  Ratifying the Greek loan facility is one step in achieving this objective.  The forthcoming referendum on the EU stability treaty will also have huge implications for Ireland's economic recovery.  Constructive debate on the European Union is welcome.  It should be discussed in an open fashion in order that any necessary improvements can be made to ensure the long-term success of the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for Finance for all his work and efforts in the European Union.  I also commend the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, for being here to listen to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_820">I will need the quarter of an hour remaining until 7 p.m., as I have spent a long time preparing what I have to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">John Healy, a journalist with <i>The Irish Times,</i> once wrote a famous book entitled, <i>No One Shouted Stop</i>.  Democracy, the cornerstone of the European Union, is under threat and those who question this are subjected to slogans and told they are eurosceptic.  This does no service to the European ideal.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">We all know one of the main causes of the Second World War was the imposition of unsustainable debts on the German people under the Treaty of Versailles.  We should never be so arrogant and complacent as to think the imposition of unsustainable debts on countries such as Greece in 2012 will not lead, in the very least, to social unrest on a massive scale, perhaps even worse.  The European Union was founded to ensure this would never happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The European project was built on the twin pillars of democracy and acting on a <i>communautaire</i> basis.  As the European Union departs from its founding principles, it will sow the seed of its own destruction.  Those who most admire and respect the European ideal should be the first to criticise it when it abandons these praiseworthy ideals in times of crisis such as this.  The actions of the member states and the European Union in trying to undermine democracy, a basic pillar of membership of the Union, by successfully imposing a technocratic government in Italy and attempting to impose a technocratic government in Greece show how fragile is democracy and the European Union itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">The Greek problem is not comparable to Ireland's in its origins, as our difficulties are essentially rooted in a banking problem wherein European banks lent colossal sums of money into the economy, sparking a lending frenzy, a property boom and an old-fashioned bubble.  The Greek crisis was due to a lack of budgetary control, leading to large budgetary deficits.  While it is clear the origins of the crises in the two countries are quite different, the consequences in both have been high unemployment, no or low growth and an unsustainable debt burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">When a country falls into debt - similar to a person or a company - lending it money at high interest rates to repay exorbitant debts, while undermining its ability to earn, which for a government means economic growth, can never form the basis of a lasting solution.  These crazy economics seem to have become the orthodoxy in Europe, yet most people who rely on everyday experience and many reputable economists realise that this does not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">We have to grasp the nettle and accept there were major flaws in the construction of the euro.  There were serious flaws in the reporting mechanisms; in the absence of central control over the financial and banking system across the eurozone; and in not providing for curbs on the transfer of large amounts of money between banks in different states in the eurozone, thus allowing the creation of the bubble that appeared in Ireland and Spain.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">When one examine the remedies being offered to Greece, the focus of the European Union, the ECB and the IMF is to try to recover the maximum amount of money for private investors.  The Greek Parliament has already been forced to pass a law giving priority to debt repayments over other government obligations.  This bailout makes debt the number one priority rather than seeking to create a financially secure and socially just Greece.  This is being done through voluntary credit swaps which have been sweetened for investors by ensuring GDP-linked securities will pay out a little more generously if Greece avoids another default.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">In their recent decisions on Greece European leaders have obtained the political benefit from scalping private creditors fully aware the actual payouts to these creditors could increase if there is growth above the projected estimates which remain ridiculously conservative.  The main beneficiaries will again be the investors rather than the Greek people.  This will put Greece in a straitjacket for many years and possibly depress effort because one could ask what is the point of increasing output if gains are being siphoned off to pay a bottomless pit of debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">In seeking a solution to the Greek problem policymakers have largely ignored Greece and its people, preferring instead to concentrate their efforts on the markets, recovery for private investors and minimising the contagion risk.  As many economists and academics have noted, the process is no longer about assisting Greece, rather the primary concern is to minimise potential losses to German and French banks.  It is against this background that the European Union must accept its share of responsibility for the Greek crisis which was largely caused by the flaws in the system it created and take drastic action to alleviate the burden imposed on the Greek people.  This could be done by means of an official debt write-off or by the European Central Bank deciding either to issue bonds to sovereigns at 1%, as it has been willing to do for private banks, or engage in quantitative easing.  In addition to the extraordinary measures that should be taken by the ECB, member states must seek to restore European economies to growth.  In the long run, this is the only viable way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">The solutions I advocate are recognised daily in business through the examinership mechanism.  Used even for the largest corporations, examinership recognises the reality of a fundamentally sustainable business with an unsustainable debt which further borrowing will not resolve.  Through this process, a write-off of as much of the debt as is required to ensure sustainability takes place.  Irrespective of how long we wait, the inevitable will happen sooner or later.  The question we must ask is this: how much misery will be caused before we realise our folly?</p>
          <p eId="para_831">As I indicated, a number of measures are needed to resolve the crisis, including a sustainable employment and growth package and a recognition that imposing enormous debts on countries arising from the follies and failures of international banking and finance corporations is neither just nor sustainable.  Further, we need to have a strong central bank in the eurozone, rather than what is effectively a federation of 17 national central banks.  A strong eurozone central bank would control the banking and financial sector, in particular, financial flows from stagnant growth areas to high growth areas in the eurozone, thus avoiding the attendant bubble effect which such transfers ultimately provoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">We should all stand back and look objectively at the big picture.  The Stability and Growth Pact implemented under the Maastricht treaty failed because action was not taken against France and Germany when they broke the pact's rules.  Already the Prime Minister of Spain has ignored the European Commission on Spanish budget deficits this year, while the leading candidate in the French general election, Mr. François Hollande, has stated his desire to renegotiate the fiscal compact agreement.  This brings to mind the Treaty of Limerick which was broken "ere the ink wherewith ‘twas writ could dry."</p>
          <p eId="para_833">In this time of crisis, instead of acting in a <i>communautaire </i>fashion, the larger countries in the eurozone are intent on protecting their national and electoral interests and private finances.  The European Union and the European Central Bank refuse to control and regulate private banking and financial services, choosing instead to focus almost exclusively on national deficits and thereby force hardship on ordinary people.  The EU and ECB theory of uncontrolled competition is seen to have failed.  This issue needs to be examined further.  If this House is to be relevant, it needs to question objectively and scrutinise every policy proposal.  Failure to do so is an abdication of duty and will lead to a further discrediting of the Oireachtas.  In a world where large countries jealously guard and protect their own interests Ireland must stand up for fair play, equity and natural justice for all the small nations in the European Union.  This is the best way to protect our interests, those of other vulnerable small nations and, ultimately, those of the European Union.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance  (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
          <p eId="para_846">I thank the House for agreeing to discuss the Bill in order that we can conclude the debate tonight.  The Bill is needed urgently to allow Ireland to ratify the changes to the Greek loan facility to implement the new programme of assistance for Greece as agreed by the euro group Finance Ministers on 20 February 2012.  I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their constructive and considered contributions to this discussion and, although I fundamentally disagree with some, it was good to have the debate.  I welcome Fianna Fail's statement that it intends to support the Bill and I appreciate the responsible and realistic stance its Members have adopted on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Many speakers referred to the burden of austerity facing the Greek people.  Strong opinions have been raised about whether the amendment Bill and the other components of the Greek programme of assistance will be successful in restoring the Greek economy.  I recognise there are sincerely held positions on all sides.  However, the stated aim of these measures, as set out by the euro group president last week, is to "allow the Greek adjustment effort to regain momentum, which - together with a rigorous implementation of the agreed policy package for the new programme - constitutes the basis for putting the public finances and the economy of Greece back on a sustainable path".  The Greek Parliament has discussed these issues and voted to approve the conditions attached to the new programme of assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">A number of Sinn Féin and socialist Members referred to the undemocratic nature of the decision-making process.  There is a technocratic Prime Minister in Greece but he was put in place on the basis of all-party agreement and he drew his Ministers from the three main parties in Greece.  The Finance Minister also served under former Prime Minister Papandreou.  The cabinet was voted in by the Greek Parliament.  We vote our Prime Minister in by parliamentary decision as well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_850">We do not vote in our Prime Minister by a vote of the people and, therefore, I do not see how the charge that the Greek Administration is not democratic stands up.  It was a free choice.  The government is an all-party coalition.  The centre right parties would not agree to participate in government with Mr. Papandreou continuing as Prime Minister and the arrangement was to appoint a new Prime Minister.  It was announced earlier that elections would be held in Greece in early May.  I do not see what is undemocratic about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">In the case of Italy, a similar arrangement prevails.  Mr. Mario Monti was voted in as Prime Minister by the Italian Parliament.  He has selected his Ministers principally from the technocratic class, and while they are not Members of Parliament, the Parliament, by a huge majority, voted in favour of and voted confidence in his Government and has implemented his programme.  In addition, the Greek Parliament, by a huge majority, voted in favour of its new programme and the prior conditions attaching to it.  As a result, I hope tomorrow that Greece will be in a position when the PSI is completed to avail of the €130 billion that is being provided under the new programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">I do not understand the Sinn Féin position.  Its Members weep for Greece.  They weep for hungry children and families who have been bereaved because of the high suicide rate but then they will vote against the provision of the €130 billion that will allow education, social welfare and health services to continue.  They weep, cry and get passionate about conditions in Greece but they purport to deprive the country of the very aid it requires.  That is a ridiculous position.</p>

It is a ridiculous position to maintain and if he had any sense of embarrassment or shame, he would not vote against the Bill because it is intended to aid the Greek people.  It is essential that they get this money quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Deputy Joe Higgins claimed that the problem in Greece was German capitalism.  In one of our frequent interchanges, I asked him before Christmas what was his solution and he replied that it was socialism.  He must have forgotten the government that put Portugal into a programme was socialist and the socialist party, PASOK, was the sole party in government in Greece.  Whatever socialism is, it is not the solution.  It seems to be the cause of the problem.  Even the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, claimed to be a socialist and he described Deputy Higgins as the only other socialist in the House at the time along with an anonymous third party.  I do not know who the third socialist was.  Perhaps he was talking about me, as I had left wing tendencies in the past.  Socialism is the problem, not the solution.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_452" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_861">Of course, the banks caused the problem as well, but the Sinn Féin and socialist position that Greece might need the money and people might go hungry but, for the sake of a principle, they will not give them €130 billion they need to keep the country going for the next few years is ludicrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">These amendments will allow for three key changes to the loan facility: a further increase of the grace period of up to ten years for paying back the loan principal, a further lengthening of the loan maturity to a minimum of 15 years, and a further reduction in the margin to 150 basis points to apply from the three-month interest period that ended on 15 June 2011.  The Bill provides for the ratification of these amendments to the Greek loan facility agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The timely acceptance of the Bill will allow for the next phase of the Greek loan facility to proceed as planned.  These changes to the facility are in conjunction with a number of other changes to the Greek programme, including the provision of additional funding of €130 billion and changed private sector involvement, PSI.  In the case of the PSI exchange offer, the closing date is tomorrow, 8 March.  Additional funding is also provided for interest rate and banking sector support.  Greece and the other euro area member states agree that it is only by fully and strictly implementing the fiscal consolidation and structural reforms included in the programme that Greece will regain competitiveness and be able to return to the markets.  These changes are intended to put Greece on a sustainable path.  I have emphasised the importance of showing solidarity with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">We should also note that there is a significant contrast between our position and that of Greece.  Our capacity to recover from our current difficulties is well recognised, given the right mix of policies at home and internationally.  The economy is estimated to have returned to growth last year and the outlook is for continued growth this year.  We have a strong export sector, with multinationals performing well, and a strengthening indigenous sector.  We are also seeing a resumption of inward foreign direct investment, which points to the fact that many of the underlying strengths of the economy remain, including a well educated workforce, favourable demographics, an open and flexible economy and a pro-enterprise environment.  Moreover, the labour market is showing welcome signs of stabilisation.  It is particularly encouraging that we saw an increase of 10,000 in the number in employment in the fourth quarter of last year on a seasonally adjusted basis, the first such increase since 2007.  Our programme implementation has been exemplary, as the troika team mentions regularly when discussing Ireland.  We have met all of our commitments to date, representing more than 90 actions.  We have met and, in some cases, exceeded all of our fiscal targets.  For 2011, our general Government deficit, at around 10% of GDP, was well within the 10.6% specified in the programme conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">Our strong programme implementation performance and the underlying strength of the economy are being recognised by the financial markets.  In recent days the ten year bond yield has moved below 7%, a considerable reduction from the 14.1% peak in July 2011.  I also remind the House that the NTMA has successfully re-engaged with the bond markets and extended the payment date of some €3.5 billion of debt which will mature just after the programme ends.  This is a significant first step in managing Ireland's post-programme funding requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">This is a time for unity among euro area countries to try to ensure stability within the euro area.  Ireland must play its part and stand in solidarity with its fellow euro area member states.  It is in the interests of the country, the euro area, the European Union as a whole and the broader world economy.  Therefore, I urge Deputies to agree to ratify the changes to the Greek loan facility.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_454">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_1125">I wish to share time with Deputies Stanley and Colreavy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I commend the work of the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">As outlined by my party colleagues in their contributions last evening, Sinn Féin supports the Technical Group motion and will vote accordingly tonight.  It is fair, however, to acknowledge that the Government's amendment comes a considerable distance to meet the demands of the TCCA.  The commitment to a comprehensive process of engagement is to be welcomed.  Looking at all the information, it really does appear, if the political will is there, that a reasonable and sensible solution is possible which will see turf cutters, the Government and the EU alike contented.  One way of demonstrating such political will would be to withdraw the Government amendment and to allow all party support for the Technical Group motion tonight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1128">That said, the practical implications of the proposed national plan for SAC raised bogs remain to be seen.  Mar a deir an seanfhocal, "Is in ithe na putóige atá an chruthú."  Whereas the Minister states he is asking "that the communities affected by the designations sacrifice, or change, part of their cultural heritage", there was talk of manoeuvrability and flexibility.  This flexibility will be absolutely essential.  The success of this process will be measured by the ability to reach agreement in all instances, but particularly in the 14 most difficult cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">I am very familiar with the position on the Moneybegs and Clareisland bogs, and those who work them.  Relocation is not an option.  Compensation is not an option.  The TCCA has proposed co-existence.  The turf cutters in that area are willing to provide alternatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">There is considerable solidarity between the individual turf cutters.  They are determined not to see those difficult cases isolated and exposed.  Domestic turf cutters, like so many of us, know their history.  Evictions, killing people with kindness or a strategy of divide and conquer will not succeed.  The Government should be aware of this as it proceeds.  I repeat my call on the Minister to withdraw the Government amendment and allow this House respond with one voice on this issue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_455">
            <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
            <p eId="para_1131">First, I commend Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan for putting forward this important motion.  It is one of the most important motions to come before this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">Before being elected, I gave a commitment to turf cutters, particularly in my area, from Coolrain, Castletown and surrounding areas, that I would do everything I could to protect their rights.  That is why I am speaking and why I have worked with Minister over the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">I welcome the protestors outside, those who have come from all parts of the country to protest and to defend their rights, which they should not have to come here to defend.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">I welcome the forum organised by the Government, Mr. Justice Quirke's report and the notion of a national plan.  The plan must be welcomed, but it needs to be done properly and in good faith.  The Turf Cutters and Contractors Association has done excellent work and has actually done a national service in producing and putting forward an excellent plan, which offers a way forward.  I thank Mr. Michael Fitzmaurice and his colleagues for that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">The whole issue has to date been handled very badly by previous Governments and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Little or no notification has been given in regard to designation.  Some turf cutters received letters, others did not.  Notices appeared in local newspapers, such as the <i>Leinster Express</i> in County Laois, which on 21 December 2002 referred to commercial turf cutting but not domestic turf cutting, which was totally misleading.  Previous Governments brushed this under the carpet and hoped it would go away but it has not.  It is here and must be dealt with.  It should have been sorted out prior to the sites being registered in the EU habitats directive in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">A national plan must deal with the bogs where turf cutters cannot be relocated to more suitable bogs.  The problem of those bogs must be solved or there is no point in a national plan.  I hope the Minister will not try to pick them off one by one.  To take the Laois situation, where two bogs in the south of the county were designated side by side, what was done to the turf cutters at Knockacoller and Coolrain was a grievous wrong, as I have discussed with the Minister.  The two bogs are the best bogs but were designated as a special area of conservation, SAC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">We have looked at all the options with the turf cutters and we have brought forward proposals, which I gave to the Minister a number of weeks ago.  There are options for compensatory habitats, which I welcome, and options to relocate the designation.  We have worked with the committee, which has gone to the forum to put those options forward.  The Killamuck bog outside Abbeyleix is 93 hectares, almost twice the size of the Coolrain bog.  It can be designated and, in fact, the locals in that area want it designated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">The whole issue of consultation must be dealt with carefully.  Mr. Justice Quirke recognised that it will take a lengthy and tortuous process of negotiation over a protracted period of time.  He said that what is most required is a determination on the part of the State to explore every avenue to accommodate those communities gravely affected by measures over which they have had little control.  There are options for the small number of bogs where relocation of turf cutters is not an option.  We need to tell Europe that the process to date has been flawed and that we need to start again.  There has to be compromise.  If necessary, we need to fly over the senior officials from Europe to show them the extra habitats that can be preserved without encroaching on turf cutters.  We need to explain to them that this is a win-win situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">We have two possible situations, namely, we can compromise or we can have confrontation.  If it is confrontation, I know which side I will be on.  I hope that does not happen.  I hope the Minister has entered into this in good faith.  He has made a good start.  I notice his speech yesterday gave a chink of light where he said there may be the option of re-designation in some cases, a point I read carefully.  Let us work together.  Let us move forward to get a solution.  Let us look after our own people, not the bondholders.  Let us look after the turf cutters in rural Ireland.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelColreavy" eId="spk_456">
            <from>Deputy Michael Colreavy</from>
            <p eId="para_1140">I commend Deputy Flanagan on bringing forward the motion, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association on its very detailed and excellent report and the people who travelled to Dublin today to protect their rights.  No one is more concerned about the natural heritage of the Irish countryside than those who live in it.  Rural people have been the guardians of this heritage despite the attack of speculators and over-zealous developers during the Celtic tiger years.  Those guardians of our natural heritage cannot be isolated or vilified now.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">There is a balance to be struck between conservation and utilising our natural resources.  Domestic turf cutting is part of the guardianship of our natural heritage.  Ireland should not attempt to model itself on the method of conservation that is prevalent in the United States, where vast areas of land are preserved with no human interaction.  Ireland does not have the land mass to sustain such a measure.  It would be far more prudent to pursue a policy where conservation goes hand in hand with rural dwellers, a policy where the guardians of our natural heritage are supported rather than punished.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">There are people and organisations in Europe and in this country who would like to see parts of our rural areas fenced off and left underdeveloped so that visitors can come to see the native people in the natural habitat.  We are not museum exhibits and we will not be treated as such.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">In the current economic climate, fuel security is a major concern of many people.  Recent harsh winters have forced people to make tough financial decisions to keep their homes warm.  Domestic turf cutting provides rural dwellers with a reasonable level of fuel security.  Families who own their own bank of bog can attain fuel security for a year at a reasonable cost.  In such circumstances, it should be a priority of the Government that these households and their successors should be able to retain heat for their homes at a time when the Government is taking so much else from them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">The proposals by the TCCA are reasonable.  It has asked for a fair deal for turf cutters and that no one who owns a bank of bog should be left out.  They have also asked for fair conditions for those who are relocated to other bogs.  There is an example at Flughany, near Tubbercurry in County Sligo, where people are being relocated to a bog at Derrykinlough, where the condition of the new bog is deplorable.  That is not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">I wait with interest to see whether the Government and the EU display the same concerns for environmental purity and sustainability when they come to consider the granting of fracking licences in beautiful north Leitrim and elsewhere.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinHeydon" eId="spk_457">
            <from>Deputy Martin Heydon</from>
            <p eId="para_1146">I will be parochial on this motion and discuss my own constituency, Mouds bog in particular.  Mr. Justice Quirke in his report referred to the breakdown in communication and a breakdown of trust between the relevant parties.  The people of Mouds bog have not been represented or properly communicated with by the State since the issue of designation first arose.  That trust is crucial to us being able, on a political level, to continue to work towards solutions to the very difficult situation regarding this bog.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">The TCCA report, for which the association is to be congratulated, highlights some of the difficulties Mouds faces.  The fact the bog is 12 to 14 miles from any potential relocation bog and that Bord na Móna admits the quality of turf there is pretty much useless for domestic turf cutters are major issues.  The risk of flooding to the many houses that have been built on nearby flood plains, should the bog be flooded or drains not maintained, is paramount to all who live at or beside Mouds bog.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">One only has to see what has happened in the past in this area to understand why the people of Mouds are so upset and hurt over the designation of their bog.  The State owns most bog complexes that surround Mouds bog.  For years, the State has stripped these bogs to their core, leaving a trail of destruction and barren deserts behind it, while at the same time the cutters on Mouds worked that bog for fuel for their own use only.  The State bogs are not worth preserving, yet due to the level of care and attention that generations of families have carried out at Mouds bog, theirs was decided for designation.  They worked the bog for generations, kept the drains clear, made sure potential dumpers were kept away and prevented and quenched many fires.  For this painstaking work, their bog was designated as an SAC without them ever being consulted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">What is worse is that groups like the Friends of the Irish Environment will try to portray these same people, who are custodians of the bog and who care more about preservation than anybody, as criminals intent on damaging the raised bog.  No wonder there has been a breakdown in trust.  Since I was elected last year, I have endeavoured to represent these people to the very best of my ability.  I undertook to travel to Brussels at short notice with my colleagues, Deputies Frank Feighan and Paul Connaughton, when the opportunity came to meet Commissioner Potočnik and to explain to him the difficulties we faced.  I have worked closely with the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, and Dr. Conor Skehan, whose contribution to this issue over the past year has been immense.  I welcome the Minister's speech yesterday, not because it announced an increase in the compensation but because it acknowledged that the genuine turf cutters on these raised bogs throughout the country have been let down in the past by State agencies and representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">Deputy Ó Cuív admitted in the House last night that there was no official derogation from the Commission and that not enough was done during Fianna Fáil's time in power.  The fact is that nothing at all was done during its time in power.  If only three or four bogs had been dealt with each year throughout that period, we would have the issue sorted out by now instead of being up against the clock, with a financial gun to our head due to threatened fines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">I also welcome the Minister's comments regarding the development of a national plan for the management of all the raised bogs designated as SACs, and that it may be possible to bring some limited flexibility for a few of the most difficult bogs where there are no alternative solutions.  There is acceptance that Mouds is one of the most difficult bogs to deal with.  I also accept that this can only be done within the framework of the habitats directive and that a plan will not be acceptable and will have no credibility if cutting continues this year on the affected bogs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">This is where we come back to trust.  The people of Mouds bog need to trust us and work with us as we continue to try to find solutions to many of the problems with this current situation.  I, for one, remain committed to representing these people who have been wronged in the past, while also ensuring we stay within the laws of Europe and that we protect the taxpayers of this country against any potential fines.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Kyne</from>
            <p eId="para_1153">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important issue.  It is difficult to believe it is almost 20 years since the legislation pertaining to the habitats directive, as contained in a previous treaty, was passed in 1992.  At the time the former Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, was in government and came home with €8 billion.  What we are dealing with was part of the small print that was not examined and ignored for many years.  No more than the water directive and the septic tank legislation, we are dealing with something that has been in place for a long time and we are trying to have the matter sorted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">I commend the Government for its work on this difficult issue for many months.  It established the Peatlands Council within the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I also welcome its proposal to commend the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TTCA, for its positive publication on dealing with the various issues surrounding SACs and natural habitat areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">There is predominantly blanket bog in Galway West, but the position on two small bogs has been raised with the TTCA.  One is to be found in Addergoole, near Annaghdown, and the TTCA indicates that there is no other bog in the area to which people could relocate.  The second is Monivea bog, near Athenry, which has been allocated objective one status and on which a large number of people depend solely for their fuel.  Another bog has been designated as a natural heritage area.  Approximately 50% of the 150 acres is raised bog.  The bog is available for sale and will cater for 80 to 90 turf owners.  The proposals are imaginative.  I hope the Minister, together with his officials in the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Peatlands Council, can provide solutions in these cases.  Yesterday Deputy Paul Connaughton outlined, in the case of the bog near Mountbellew, how things could be sorted out through negotiation and consensus and by acknowledging the important role turf cutters had to play in any solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">We welcomed Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan to a meeting I attended in Rossaveal in the autumn.  A large crowd expressed concerns about blanket bogs.  The problem arose predominantly during the summer of 2011 when special protection areas, SPAs, were designated in parts of Connemara.  Some believed what had happened on raised bogs in east Galway would happen on blanket bogs in Connemara and that the SPA designation was part of this process.  As I pointed out at the time, the SPA designation affords no greater protection than SAC designation in terms of turf cutting.  I undertook to set up a meeting which the Minister attended.  Mr. Conor Ó Raghallaigh from the National Parks and Wildlife Service answered questions from the delegation which consisted of a cross-section of individuals from Connemara on special areas of conservation and blanket bogs.  The responses were made available to all Oireachtas Members in Galway West and the local committees.  People were happy with the responses received.  While there is a need to revisit how turf cutting activities are regulated, this can best be done in consultation with turf cutters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">Turf cutting will continue in the case of blanket bog SACs, but we must undertake surveys of turf cutting within the SACs and map the areas most sensitive to the potential impacts of turf cutting.  This approach will be undertaken while engaging with stakeholders to agree a conservation management approach for sites which should provide clarity for all parties on how turf cutting will proceed.  The western end of the Connemara bog complex is likely to be included in a pilot area in teasing out the best approach for us to adopt.  We will seek to engage with representatives of turf cutters and other interested parties during 2012 to arrive at the best approach for all involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">There is a general acceptance in Connemara that there is a need to protect SACs and provide management plans for them.  There is consensus among turf cutters on the Minister's approach.  As long as the owners who cut turf are consulted by the Minister's office, in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, they will be happy that their concerns are being taken on board.  I welcome the Government's approach.</p>

          <speech by="#ArthurSpring" eId="spk_459">
            <from>Deputy Arthur Spring</from>
            <p eId="para_1159">The habitats directive was issued by the European Union in 1992 and transposed into Irish law in 1997.  In a statutory instrument the State designated a number of bogs as special areas of conservation.  It deemed that in order to comply with the directive turf cutting had to cease completely on the designated raised bogs.  It sought and received a derogation from the necessity to cease turf cutting for ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">Article 2.3 of the habitats directive states measures taken pursuant to it "shall take into account economic, social and cultural requirements and regional and local characteristics".  I do not wish to lecture my constituency colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, on bogs, as I empathise with him as the bog at issue in north Kerry is the very one on which his grandfather cut turf.  Given that I was deemed to be the perfect height for turning turf when I was out of nappies, I understand our legacy.  I have been involved in the issue for the past 20 years.  My father was one of the first to say the designation of the candidate special areas of conservation would present an enormous problem for the country.  At the time candidate special areas of conservation were analysed with a view to determining what it meant not only in environmental or fuel security terms, to which previous speakers referred, but also culturally and, more importantly, societally.  I recall the days spent on the bog with one's family and friends and the endeavour and toil involved and what it meant to a group and the attachment to the land.  There is a line by Christy Moore, "If talk of turf drives you crazy ... make for Inch".  Unfortunately, Inch is where my interest lies on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">The landmass designated as a special area of conservation here is bigger than anywhere else in Europe.  We have to go back to the European Union to say we thought that there would be a process of analysis of candidate special areas of conservation to the point where the National Parks and Wildlife Service would state some areas would be converted to special areas of conservation but others would not.  One must take the human dimension into account as it is more important than anything else.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">It is welcome that the issue has come to a head tonight.  I say to those gathered outside Leinster House that there is more than turf cutting at stake.  Those affected include people who are trying to develop their land, while farmers also have a stake in the issue.  As long as we have a consultation process, we can come up with a solution.  I welcome the Minister's statement that there will be comprehensive engagement and that a national plan will be put in place.  In some cases, relocation is probably not the solution.  We must examine what is coming from the European Union.  The Government has a big cleaning-up act to do and we will have to do it on the habitats directive also.</p>

          <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_460">
            <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
            <p eId="para_1163">I commend my colleague, Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan, for bringing the motion before the House.  This is a sensitive issue, one that would not have arisen if Departments and previous Governments had listened to people on the ground.  Having worked on it for five or six years, a little over a year ago I addressed a meeting in the Hodson Bay hotel in Athlone at which I said I would sign my name in blood to ensure everything possible would be done to address the needs and concerns of turf cutters in the light of the restrictions imposed by the European Union.  I have honoured that intention and will continue to fight hard to ensure a workable solution is found which meets the satisfaction of turf cutters.  That is what co-operation is about.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">We said, working with all stakeholders, we would set up an independent Peatlands Council, under the supervision of Mr. Conor Skehan who has done an amazing job in working with all those involved in turf cutting to try to ensure their concerns are brought to the table.  The Europeand Union and the previous Government were inflexible.  Departmental officials showed scant interest for the concerns of turf cutters.  Last July when we were worried that fines would issue from the European Union, I said at a parliamentary party meeting that we should bypass the officials in the Department and go directly to Brussels.  I thank those who supported me in making that call.  We received support from strange circles.  I thank Deputy Peter Mathews, the Deputy for Dublin South, for supporting us in that move.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">I travelled to Brussels with Mr. Skehan and Deputies Paul Connaughton and Martin Heydon.  It was horrifying, when we mentioned a ten year derogation to Mr. Potočnik, to hear him say there was no such derogation.  How could a Government have stated there was a derogation when there was none?  The actions of the Friends of the Irish Environment group have been corrosive in this situation.  When we went to Brussels, we were shown a file sent by this group stating that turf cutting should not continue.  There was nothing in that file from Government or anyone else stating that turf cutting should continue.  Who are the Friends of the Irish Environment?  Whom does this group represent?  It does not represent me or the people on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">I have not shied away from attempting to ensure those most affected will be financially compensated.  I went to the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, over a month ago and told him that the €1,000 per annum compensation over 15 years was not enough.  I am delighted that the Minister ceded to my request to increase that €1,000 to €1,500 per annum.  I thank him for the work he has done in this area.  I also thank the Taoiseach for his huge interest in this difficult situation.  I will continue to work in government to ensure that turf cutters rights are protected.  We are not fools.  We will protect the environment and will ensure that people working together get along.  I thank everyone for working together in trying to resolve this difficult situation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy</from>
            <p eId="para_1167">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I thank Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan and his colleagues for bringing forth this motion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">A series of Governments ignored what needed to be done in terms of consultation with people on this issue, resulting in genuine and decent people being at odds with the directive.  This Government has taken a positive approach to this issue.  I welcome the establishment by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, of the Peatlands Council and the forum under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Quirke and the putting in place of a national peatlands strategy, all of which should have be done a long time ago.  However, I am delighted it is being done now.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">As has been said, this is an emotive issue.  It is easy to engage in negativity.  The real challenge is to work together to achieve a solution.  I am delighted the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, which enjoys the trust of turf cutters throughout the country, is using its leadership role to engage and make positive suggestions.  Its contribution and that of Mr. Justice Quirke will be critical in terms of engagement with people in finding a resolution to this issue.  Many other people have worked hard to bring this matter to a conclusion.  In this regard, I commend Irish Rural Link and Mr. Seamus Boland on their work in finding alternative bogs for people in Clara wishing to continue to cut turf.  Through the relationship built up with Bord na Móna by Irish Rural Link, people came together and reached a conclusion, as in the case of Mountbellew.  Through my engagement on this issue with people I discovered that while many people had received forms from the Department, they had forgotten to fill them in and return them.  I urge people to make an informed decision on this issue and to fill and return their forms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">Our business around the environment has gotten a little lost in the debate on this issue.  We have enjoyed the benefits of turf cutting for 400 years but we must now look to the future in terms of the type of country we will hand over to our children and the next generation.  We must not lose sight of the fact that we need to reduce our carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.  We must look to the future in terms of what we will leave behind for our children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1171">Many bogs have the potential for other uses.  People will not lose ownership of their bogs.  I urge the Minister to involve landowners in management of their bogs.  Landowners will get involved and will look for other uses for the bogs that will not result in the type of damage caused in some areas.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_462">
            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_1172">I will be brief in my contribution on this emotive issue which has been badly handled, or not handled at all, for years.  Turf cutters and the people of rural Ireland who have taken care of the environment for centuries have been criminalised owing to mismanagement of this issue in recent years.  Trust and respect went out the window and as a result of the crossfire, which has been ongoing in recent years in particular, no solution could be found.  There now appears to be some light at the end of the tunnel.  I hope a solution can be found which is acceptable to the turf cutters, rural dwellers, the Minister and Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">I compliment the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, on the work he has done in the past year which illustrates that the only way to resolve a matter is to tackle it head on.  The Minister engaged with the people through the establishment of the Peatlands Council under the chairmanship of Mr. Conor Skehan and the forum under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Quirke.  All of us on this side of the House worked in the background with the Minister on this issue.  I compliment two Members in particular - Deputy Frank Feighan and Deputy Paul Connaughton - who, when other people were jumping up and down, as it were, about this issue, were working hard behind the scenes to find a solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">I welcome that a management plan is to be put in place for the cutting of turf on blanket bogs, of which there are many in my constituency, and that it will continue into the future.  In putting this plan in place, we are being proactive rather than reactive.  An advertisement in a newspaper to the effect that cutting of turf on blanket bogs was to be restricted, which was a mistake, resulted in a near meltdown of phones in my constituency office.  I commend the Minister on ensuring this situation was remedied quickly.  I have no doubt that through engagement with communities, we will not end up in the type of mess we have been in recent years and which is now being addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">What we need in this debate is not a victory for anyone but a solution to the problem.  I suggest that the Minister withdraw his amendment and that Deputy Flanagan withdraw his motion in order that the progress made can be brought across the line, thus ensuring turf cutters and rural dwellers can live in harmony using the resources for the betterment of our children.</p>

            <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</from>
            <p eId="para_1176">I compliment the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on his appointment of Mr. Conor Skehan as chairman of the Peatlands Council, which has done a great deal of positive work in the past year.  It must be acknowledged that it was the fault of the Government in place in 1992 when the habitats directive was introduced that no one understood what was going on.  As stated by a previous speaker, all we saw was the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, coming home with billions.  We took no heed of what problems would arise as a result of the introduction of that directive.  This will never happen again.  We will not be caught out in respect of future directives from Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">I compliment Mr. Conor Skehan on travelling the country to meet turf cutters and other stakeholders and to engage with people in a positive manner.  There is a coolness and calmness about Mr. Skehan that disarmed people who might otherwise have responded in an aggressive manner.  As for Mr. Justice Quirke's forum, I note that although it only took place last week, a report issued therefrom within seven days.  Had this been the case for the Mahon tribunal and all the rest, it would have saved us a fortune.  A man like that must be complimented on his hard work.  I am very disappointed with Deputy Ó Cuív.  Although he was the Minister for a number of years, last night he stated that nothing was done for ten years and blamed the Department.  There is an old phrase that if the driver of a cart is no good, the cart can go nowhere.  I will leave it at that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">As a young fellow, I took turf from blanket bogs in County Wicklow and it was all sleán turf.  In this context, I must compliment Mr. Colm Harrigan, who is the only person who hand-cuts turf in all the special area of conservation, SAC, bogs.  He is a vital heritage emblem who should be recognised.  In addition, it should be recognised that potentially, he is a tourism asset and this should be taken on board.  While the Minister has done much work, there is a great deal more work to do.  I approve of his flexibility and long may it continue.  In addition, I approve of the manner in which the Minister put in place a national plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_1179">Briefly, I call for a compromise on this issue.  I urge all parties to continue to sit around the table in an effort to find a satisfactory solution to this delicate and sensitive issue.  In my constituency and in particular in County Laois, it is not about compensation but is about relocation and there are consequential difficulties in that regard.  I congratulate Mr. Conor Skehan for his great efforts, as well as the Minister, Deputy Deenihan.  However, I cannot say the same about the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which has acted in a high-handed and insensitive manner and to my mind, a public body that does so must be condemned.  I believe it has a duty to act in good faith and to be sensitive to the needs of the local turf cutters.  I believe there are probable grounds for a successful legal challenge, particularly with regard to the unfairness of the selection of the SACs in the first instance, as well as in respect of breaking agreements between the State and turf cutters over the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">I urge mediation and conciliation.  The House should not divide and I urge my namesake, Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan, to withdraw the motion in the interest of continued roundtable discussions in order that a reasonable and common sense approach can be found to what is a highly difficult and sensitive issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1181">I am relieved the Minister has offered an enhanced compensation package to the bog owners and acknowledge his rational and fair-minded approach to what has been a 20-year communications breakdown between the State and turf cutters.  However, I greatly desire an assurance that the Minister and the Government are singing from the same hymn sheet on this announcement.  I do not wish to see a scenario in which the Minister announces a measure to defuse rising anger only for the European Union or officials subsequently to rain on his parade to the detriment of turf cutters.  While I do not suggest this will happen, there has been a long history of disconnection between the State and turf cutters.  Consequently, it is important to be assured that the full resolution of the State is behind this announcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">I have lobbied through the many stages of the turf cutters' battle for fair treatment.  In the constituency of Longford-Westmeath, many bogs have been affected and there is great fear.  This constitutes a huge blow to the farming community in my constituency, which has some of the finest bogs in the country.  I have seen the anger and frustration among turf cutters in Longford-Westmeath and there should be a great easing of tension following this announcement of what will amount to a total of €23,000 for effected bog owners.  Moreover, I have every confidence the Minister also will see the overall picture encompassing the heritage and traditional skills.  I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of huge numbers of people from my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tony McLoughlin</from>
            <p eId="para_1185">In common with many others, my constituency has a long history of turf cutting.  In respect of self-sufficiency, this fuel ensures a sustainable method of heating homes in rural areas in particular.  Given the increase in recent years in the price of oil and coal in international markets, the loss of this fuel is a real concern to many people who use turf as their solid fuel.  A dilemma now exists with regard to balancing the 1992 habitats directive against the wishes of the aforementioned turf cutters.  The Commission has moved to issue a reasoned opinion with regard to turf cutting and it is clear it expects the Government to act on what it perceives to be illegal turf cutting on SAC raised bogs.  The only option open to the Minister and the Government is the provision of adequate compensation packages for turf cutters in those sites where continued turf cutting is no longer possible for reasons of environmental protection.  Last night, the Minister announced an enhanced package for turf cutters in the SAC areas.  I believe it is fair, while one wishes that most of those who qualify for this scheme are to continue to be allowed to cut their own turf.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">I commend the many Deputies who have worked hard to find solutions, together with the Minister.  I wish to single out my colleague, Deputy Feighan, for his work on the ground and in government.  He has done much behind the scenes in providing an option on the compensation package.  I also acknowledge the work of Mr. Conor Skehan as chairman of the Peatlands Council.  He has worked extensively in meeting many groups and securing an agreement on many areas such as his council's pursuit of alternative compensation for individuals, together with an annual supply of turf on non-designated bogs as an interim measure to meet the energy needs of turf cutters for house energy upgrades.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">In conclusion, both the present Administration and its predecessor have found themselves in a difficult situation when trying to satisfy the concerns of the aforementioned European Union directive, as well as the genuine case of the turf cutters.  I believe the compromise set out by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, is very welcome and I commend him on his work.</p>

Attempts often are made in the Dáil in particular to create a rural-city divide and opportunities such as this debate demonstrate that one should have solidarity with one's rural brothers and sisters in this regard.  In general, this is a national class divide, not a rural-city divide.  Opportunities such as this are important to make this point.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">The motion represents a reasonable and sensible solution, which meet the needs of conservation of the bogs and the domestic turf cutters.  I congratulate the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association for its work in consulting turf cutters, which it carried out in a highly professional manner.  It brought into focus the views of people who felt excluded and unrepresented.  This approach contrasts sharply with the bureaucratic and cackhanded approach of the Government and the European Union as far back as 1986, when negotiations on the habitats directive commenced.  People today, in both urban and rural areas, are very much aware of the need to protect their environment and heritage.  I take this opportunity to point out the threats to our environment do not come from ordinary citizens either in Ireland or internationally.  In general, they come from multinational corporations and big business.  As I stated, people are open to issues regarding their environment and are open to change.  However, nothing can raise their hackles like unknown, unelected and insensitive bureaucrats in Brussels or elsewhere taking such top-down decisions without consultation or reference as to how they might affect ordinary people.  The Minister has offered to increase compensation but as far as I can ascertain, this is not the issue.  This motion, which is based on a detailed survey of domestic turf cutters and contractors and utilises their knowledge, is the way forward.  It would conserve 98% of raised bog in special areas of conservation.  Moreover, turf will only be cut in small group areas, which will limit any damage to a negligible level.  Furthermore, this will apply only in a small number of bogs and in the vast majority of bogs, people will be able to relocate to a nearby bog under these proposals.  It is a reasonable and sensible approach that should be adopted by the Government.  I request all Members to support the motion tabled by Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan.  Moreover, the Government should withdraw its amendment and support the original motion in full.</p>

Other members of the Technical Group and I were very happy to put our names to it because we view the proposals it contains as very reasonable.

            <p eId="para_1196">Yes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">Several previous speakers referred to a particular issue, namely, that which relates to process.  It is easy to blame Brussels.  We must begin to look to ourselves rather than blaming Brussels.  We must accept our own culpability in respect of certain matters.  I do not know the number of occasions on which a Part 8 process would have been initiated - as part of which newspaper advertisements, etc., would have been placed - and it would not have been until the machines rolled in or the letters arrived that people realised the impact the said process would have on them.  We must learn from matters of this nature.  An impact assessment process must be put in place in order that we might avoid the kind of unnecessary conflict which can arise.  It often takes a massive effort, at both official and voluntary level, to resolve conflicts of this nature.  We should look to ourselves in the context of seeking solutions in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">Cutting bogs did not merely begin a couple of hundred years ago.  Turf cutting dates back thousands of years.  Many archaeologists attribute to it an almost mythical status.  Bogs were often seen as the crossing over point between the human and spirit worlds.  Many of the artefacts which have been discovered in bogs were buried for just that reason.  Bogs have proven to be virtual treasure troves and people out cutting turf have discovered some priceless artefacts.  I refer in this regard to the terrific manuscript that was uncovered only five or six years ago.  Clonycavan man, who was discovered in a bog, is now part of an exhibition and his body has given us so much information about the past.  The acidic nature of bog water and the lack of oxygen within bogs does not allow the type of decomposition which would occur at other locations to take place.  We have gained so much more from our boglands than mere turf.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">There is a strong cultural aspect to turf cutting which was missed when the habitats directive was under consideration.  I am concerned with regard to whether we are using the correct conservation methods.  We received a briefing on the Fernandez report in recent days.  This report indicates that some of the raised bogs which have not been cut during the past ten years have diminished to some extent.  It also states that the opposite is true of some of the bogs which have been cut.  If we are to approach this matter from the point of view of conservation, the evidence in the report to which I refer gives rise to a number of questions to which we must seek answers.  Those answers must be found if the object of the exercise is to conserve what is unique about the habitats of raised bogs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">I return to the issue of process.  We have encountered so many difficulties in this regard.  One need only consider what happened at Rossport to realise that this is the case.  Everyone in the House could highlight matters which escaped people's attention until they realised they was going to impact on them in a very negative way.  In addition to finding a solution to the matter under discussion, we must also find a solution with regard to how we go about our business.  We are not particularly good at resolving matters and this is certainly an issue which demonstrates that.</p>

            <p eId="para_1201">As a result of our high regard for land and property in this country, initiatives which interfere with the rights of landowners will be always contentious.  In many respects, this is a result of our history and the fact that for many years Irish people were subdued by and lived under a foreign regime.  Land has been always seen as being of high value.  In many instances people were banished from the land and were fortunate thereafter to obtain unpredictable rights of tenancy in respect of it.  Much of this is due to that which we inherited from the past, when people were obliged to try to make their livelihoods in very tough conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">People have an attachment to land, be it arable, mountain or bog.  Land is generally a priority for them.  This is even more the case at present as a result of the rising cost of imported fuels and the long tradition of bog owners having discretion to cut and harvest turf.  The latter is a precious resource and it will be even more valuable in the future.  The owners of bogs have been excellent custodians of their properties over the years.  Fortunately, these individuals have ensured their properties are properly drained and that there is no unnecessary damage to habitats.  Sensible and sustainable annual maintenance has ensured that the bogs to which I refer are environmentally-friendly in the context of wildlife, fauna, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">I commend all the stakeholders involved on trying to resolve this divisive issue in a practical manner.  Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan, the turf cutters, the contractors association and the bog owners have been extremely proactive over a long period and have arrived at a satisfactory and agreeable resolution.  The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, has for many years promoted and enhanced the heritage of his native county, Kerry, and other places throughout the country.  On many occasions, he has - in both a political and voluntary capacity - done a great deal to assist various organisations and to promote different projects in his native county.  The Minister is a pragmatist and he takes a good, practical approach to all issues.  He understands the unique importance of striking a fair balance with regard to accommodating the rights of members of the general public in the context of carrying on with existing traditions and making provision for their own domestic fuel needs.  I welcome the sizeable increase in compensation and the once-off financial incentive.  The Minister has taken an extremely positive approach in the context of negotiating these measures at Cabinet level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan and the other members of his delegation informed me that they received an extremely favourable reception when they visited the EU Commission, which was a fitting reward for all their efforts.  The Deputy and his counterparts put forward very logical, practical and workable proposals.  As a result, some 98% of bogs will be conserved.  In addition, plot holders will be facilitated.  Particular sections of bogs will be set aside and those parts that are not cut will remain intact under the mechanism of compensatory habitat exchange.  I understand this proposal is acceptable to those in Europe and if it provides a solution, we should pursue it.  It may take some time but if we can get an assurance that this will eventually be acceptable, we should come to a firm agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">Both the turf cutters and the preserved bog can live side by side in co-existence.  I am hopeful that with the minority of bogs where there is no suitable alternative location with the same quality of turbary rights adjacent to existing bogs, under the conservation measure we can seek a resolution to these matters.  We should certainly put the matter to bed tonight in this House and we will carry it to the European Commission.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</from>
            <p eId="para_1206">I thank the Technical Group Members for sharing some of their time with me.  I thank Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan for bringing forward this very important Private Members' motion, and I thank the excellent people, such as Pat Fitzpatrick, who worked with the Deputy and have put much time and effort into the issue.  I acknowledge the work of the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, including Mr. Michael Fitzmaurice and his great team of people.  I compliment them on their excellent work going the length and breadth of this country to endless meetings, with site visits to bogs and for putting together an excellent set of proposals on each of the 57 raised bogs.  I acknowledge and welcome the sound people who have travelled from all parts of Ireland to the Gallery and outside on Kildare Street.  They are most welcome in coming here tonight to show their support for the Private Members' motion.  A massive amount of detail was put into the report and it must be appreciated by all of us.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">There was a breakdown of trust in the past on this very important matter.  The cutting of turf is one of the most important and basic rights of rural dwellers and any threat to that way of life would always have been resisted in the strongest possible manner.  The TCCA proposal, which would ensure the protection of 98% of the raised bogs, is very generous and much thought, consideration and negotiation went into seeking agreement from turf cutters to congregate in 2% of bogs.  We should remember that there are bogs where there is no alternative and relocation is impossible.  Those turf cutters must be allowed to continue to cut turf.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">Having studied the data in great detail, it should be noted that over the years, bogs which have lost much of their natural habitats may not have been cut at all.  In other words, bogs that are worked have a greater chance of retaining their habitats than neglected bogs.  This flies in the face of EU directives but it would not be the first time what people in the EU were telling us what to do would lack common sense.  God help us but many of these people writing rules on raised bogs would not know one end of a slean from another; they would not know what is a sod of turf, the majority would never have seen an open fire in a house and if they did, they would call the fire brigade and run.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">The studies do not support statements made by the Minister last night when he referred to the dramatic decline in raised bogs.  I listened very closely to the Minister's contribution and his amendment following from Mr. Justice Quirke's report.  I acknowledge the Kerry turf cutters, who represent people who have cut turf all their lives and who have constantly spoken of the lack of contact by present and previous Governments on this very important matter.  I will cite the example of the turf cutters who worked in a bog just outside Listowel, where there is no alternative place to cut turf.  I am alarmed by what the Minister proposes.  We cannot have a position where anybody who cut turf traditionally over the years will face into the next couple of months-----</p>

I certainly take no comfort from the Minister increasing compensation because the real traditional turf cutters do not want compensation; they want to cut turf.  In many instances, it has been stated that the only people who wanted compensation were those who did not exercise their rights to cut turf in the past.  Turf cutters are not for sale and will not sell out on their heritage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">It is a sad day for Ireland when we must debate this motion at all as the people who came before us would turn in their graves at the idea of European law being passed into Irish law in order to stop people cutting turf anywhere.  Nevertheless I thank the people who put so much work into trying to reach a solution, including Bord na Móna, the Peatlands Council, the TCCA, officials in the Department, the Minister, and most important, the people who work in the bogs.  I thank Deputy Flanagan for his work.  May Paddy Concannon rest in peace.  We are continuing the fight and we will not lie down now or ever.  Tonight is not the end, it is only the beginning.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_1214">I am delighted to be able to speak to the motion tonight.  I compliment Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan, his colleague, Mr. Pat Fitzpatrick, and Mr. Michael Fitzmaurice of the TCCA.  I compliment these people on the hard work done and the leadership shown to many other groups in rural Ireland.  They have illustrated how compromise is achieved.  It does not come about by sitting at a gas fire or in a plush Dublin 4 apartment but through people power, with the population in rural Ireland saying to this and previous Governments that they should be listened to.  The people of rural Ireland have a voice, make sense and are decent, law abiding and pay their way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, should be complimented on entering into negotiations with Deputy Flanagan and the TCCA.  I also note Mr. Justice Quirke's examination of the issue.  We begged for action from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, "big Phil the enforcer", as people like to call him in the environment committee and in the Chamber.  We wanted him to enter consultation but he did not.  People must be consulted and listened to.  We cannot have diktats from Europe added to in Dublin and we cannot have the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, getting pats on the shoulder from Angela Merkel and others.  We asked people to put on the green jersey last week and renegotiate the criminal amounts that we owe but that did not happen.  The Taoiseach signed the treaty and was all smiles.  Bhí sé ag gáire but we must do better.  We are a reasonable and fair people who will pay our way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">Deputy Coffey knows there is a bog in Port Láirge freisin.  We pay our way and we are an honest and proud people.  We are proud of our heritage and nothing is more a part of that heritage than the bogs of Ireland.  Our forefathers were able to live and eat because of the turf they saved in all kinds of weather, barefoot and working with the sleans mentioned by Deputy Healy-Rae.  There were no machines at that time.  They made a living and paid for children to be educated.  Unfortunately, many people had to emigrate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">The European Commission and Irish officials want to change this.  I do not blame Governments much, rather officials and the bureaucracy in Ireland.  The people involved sign off on everything.  We have seen figures in documents such as the Fernando Fernandez Valverde report, which indicates a 90% decrease in habitat in eight neglected bogs in comparison to bogs that were worked.  I remember ABBA's song "Fernando" in 1974.  Do you hear the drums calling Fernando?  I say to Enda, Eamon and Jimmy-----</p>

            <p eId="para_1220">A letter from North Tipperary County Council was sent with regard to the development of the Nore Valley bog on 27 February 2012.  It was addressed to dear sir or madam.  This is nice language; the county council could not address the person by name.  The letter stated it had come to the attention of the planning authority that the person may have carried out unauthorised development consisting of peat extraction at Nore Valley bog, Timoney, Roscrea, County Tipperary.  What next?  We cannot harvest our bogs.  My goodness.  Skyscrapers were allowed to be built in Dublin and the Seanie FitzPatricks got away with murder.  No one has been sent to jail.  However, people are being threatened with fines over turf.  The letter sent by North Tipperary County Council is a disgrace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">A colleague of the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, stated a letter was sent in error last week.  The officials who send out these letters should be censured.  I will not say they should be demoted or sacked but they should certainly be censured.  Why should they undermine the Government?  Why do they cause people fear?  Why do they create an urban rural divide?  Is it because of their selfish need for promotion?  It is callous, ignorant and unfair to rural people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">We can take a leaf out of the book of Deputy Luke "Ming" Flanagan, and we can also do so with regard to the legislation that will create Water Ireland.  This would mean listening to people and sitting down and engaging with them.  We are a fair people and we will not be portrayed as a dirty people.  What is most disenchanting to rural people is being portrayed as not caring for the environment.  They are the best carers for the environment and for our built and natural heritage and they will continue to be so.  Turf will be cut no matter what the bureaucrats say.</p>

            <p eId="para_1229">I do know if one has a problem in business one must address the issues and deal with them.  One finds a solution and moves on.  I find it strange that the problems surrounding bogs and turf cutting have been around for a long time without resolution and I wonder why this is.  There is little doubt the people protesting this evening and the turf cutters who have fought for so long have engaged in what is known as active citizenship.  If one wants to change how things are done in this country active citizenship is how to do it.  One cannot depend on us politicians to change the world.  It is important that people develop a voice.  Getting a vote once every five years is not enough.  One needs a voice to raise one's concerns and be heard.  If one wants to challenge the <i>status quo</i>, which must be done sometimes, and if one wants to challenge the bureaucracy which impedes progress, one must develop this voice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">As an outsider looking in I believe if the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, was a private body it would have lost its contract a long time ago.  Over 14 years a total of €750 million has been spent with no resolution.  The performance of the NPWS leaves much to be desired.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">Bogs were designated behind people's backs with only 27 of the people being informed.  There was a lack of clarity with regard to commercial and domestic turf cutting.  People were denied access to information.  They could not even get the Fernandez report without using the freedom of information process.  There was no transparency or accountability.  Have we ever heard this before?</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">Domestic turf cutters were threatened by the agency with legal prosecution.  People had their doors kicked by those working for the agency.  It entered into 1,200 agreements, reneging on almost half of them.  The NPWS felt it had Europe behind it.  It certainly had the money.  However, an EU Commission report found that 94% of the people of Ireland did not know anything about the habitats directive; so much for what it was up to.  The task of progressing this further should not be left with those who have failed for the past 14 years.  A lack of trust has developed between them and the turf cutters.  We need a new body that will build trust with the people, take forward the turf cutters' initiative and develop a national plan for the bogs and fairness for everyone concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1233">There is no difference in the objective of what the two motions before the House set out to achieve.  Much of the language in the Government's counter motion is taken directly from the Technical Group's motion as proposed by Deputy Luke Flanagan.  The key difference is that the Government amendment builds on the original motion to include reference to the Quirke report, which was not available when the original motion was submitted on Friday.  The Government amendment goes further than the motion proposed by Deputy Flanagan by commending the Government's acceptance of Mr. Justice Quirke's central recommendation that all bogs should be considered in a single national plan.  In the context of such a plan it may be possible to bring limited flexibility for the most difficult bogs where there are no apparent alternative solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">While we cannot second-guess the outcome of this process I know my area in south Galway is one of those where obtaining suitable relocation bog is proving very difficult.  This plan offers a way forward and a way to examine the case of this and similar areas in real detail.  Such a plan would build on the proposals put forward by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, relating to all the affected raised bogs.  The Government's counter motion, using the language of the original motion, explicitly acknowledges the TCCA's proposals.  The Government acknowledges the commitment and leadership of Michael Fitzmaurice, and his colleagues in the TCCA, in developing proposals to address the very difficult issues we face.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">The Government's motion also reflects the general commitment to work together with all parties to develop a shared understanding and future of the special area of conservation bogs as well as the specific commitment to work with each affected local community.  It further acknowledges the enhanced compensation package announced by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, last night.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">Thanks to the work of Mr. Justice Quirke, the Government can now begin to give concrete commitments to a shared way forward over and above those contained in the original motion.  We have endured a saga of options taken and not taken, procrastination, wishful thinking and denial which has led to a serious breakdown in communication and trust between many turf cutters and the State.  Turning this relationship around will not be easy but there is hope.  The Peatlands Council chaired by Conor Skehan has started the difficult process of building clearer communications between turf cutting interests, relevant State parties and NGOs.  The peatlands forum under Mr. Justice John Quirke has given the communities on all 53 sites the opportunity to air their grievances and concerns, present their proposals and engage with the State to start the process of finding solutions and rebuilding valuable trust.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">The pioneering spirit of turf cutting communities in Clara and Mount Bellew, working with Bord na Móna and the NPWS, have shown trust can be rebuilt and relocation can be successfully delivered.  The honest and constructive engagement of the Irish Farmers Association through Padraic Divilly has contributed significantly to finding acceptable solutions.  The Government has now provided clarity on the enhanced compensation and has demonstrated its resolve to move ahead in delivering relocation options.  The European Commission has also indicated its willingness to work with all parties to find a long-term resolution to this issue in the parameters of EU law.  The Taoiseach indicated to me this evening that he will organise a delegation to travel to Brussels to engage with the Commission at the very highest level to work towards securing this resolution.</p>

            <p eId="para_1239">In just one year the Government has travelled further on this issue than was travelled in the previous 12 years.  I hope the House will acknowledge our earnest endeavours to protect the rights of turf cutters and the State's interest in the face of litigation and secure the long-term conservation of these sites.  Deputies such as Frank Feighan, Paul Connaughton, Martin Heydon and Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, to name but a few, have also worked hard to bring parties together.  This is a time for strong leadership from all sides.  The honest, hard-working and law-abiding people to whom Mr. Justice Quirke listened last week are anxious to achieve an agreed way forward on this difficult issue.  We owe it to them and the wider community to accept Mr. Justice Quirke's advice and move ahead.  Together we can develop a new relationship of partnership, co-operation and trust.</p>

            <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_1240">To those outside who are listening to this debate, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for travelling up here so late in the evening on a school day.  This was very difficult to do but you did it.  When we organised this debate, we knew this would be a major challenge.  Fair dues to those who travelled.  They have stepped up to the mark and I am proud of them.  It is unbelievable that so many have turned out today.  It is because of them that I am in this House, sitting in its comfortable seats.  I am their servant and I am serving them today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">This is not a new battle.  Some may say it began in 1992 but it started 106 years ago in Cloonerco bog when people in the area were told they could no longer cut their turf because the powers-that-be at the time found someone more important to make use of it.  When they took the turf banks off local people, Father Michael O'Flanagan, who was, coincidentally, the first man to utter words in Dáil Éireann when he said the prayer at its first sitting, stood by them.  He went into the bog, cut turf with them and won the battle.  This event showed the depth of passion and importance of turf cutting.  Even when the church turned against Fr. O'Flanagan, local people who would have been terrified to stand up to the church on many other issues boarded up the windows and doors of Cliffoney Church.  While having lunch yesterday, I met a man whose father hammered some of the nails into the church.  He is still proud of what his father did.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">This is not an issue that can be solved by money.  If that were the case, the problem would have been solved a long time ago.  This is about much more than money or keeping one's house warm, although that is the most important aspect of the issue.  This is about our culture.  Turf means everything where I and the Taoiseach come from.  Incidentally, I appreciate the Taoiseach's presence in the House for this debate.  Turf cutting is part of our humour, a way to meet people and work with our families that townies like me have never been able to share.  When turf cutters see a Ferrari on television, they will usually comment, "I wonder how good that would be at pulling turf out of the bog."  If we see a helicopter, we do not wonder if it is the National Parks and Wildlife Service but ask whether if it could pull turf out of the bog.  When we see the desert of Dubai on television someone will always say, "One would not be long drying the turf there."</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">The Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, has engaged with the State all along the line.  We are good citizens and do not seek conflict as it is not in our interests.  We first engaged with the interdepartmental committee on the cessation of turf cutting.  Despite its title being abhorrent to our organisation, we gave the interdepartmental committee our report and engaged with it.  We then engaged with the Joint Committee on European Affairs and told it our story.  The joint committee told us we had one hell of a case and needed help.  We subsequently engaged with the Peatlands Council and told it our story.  None of these engagements has produced a successful result.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">Last week, in Athlone we attended the peatlands forum.  While one could argue that someone who has been bitten by a dog is wary about rubbing the dog's head again, we went to the forum and met Mr. Justice John Quirke.  The judge listened to us, documented our stories and showed compassion.  He was obviously moved by what was said which is easy to understand because men from the country do not cry easily, even if it would be better for us mentally to do so.  The hardest of men, those who believe crying makes them soft, stood in front of Mr. Justice Quirke and cried their eyes out.  A lady, with whom we became friendly over the course of the meeting, came to the forum to record people's feelings.  She was amazed that one person after another broke down and cried in front of the camera.  None of the men or women in question will be given an Oscar for acting because there was no acting involved.  This is a serious issue.  Mr. Justice Quirke heard how suicide had come into families because of the strain this issue has caused.  He listened to those who spoke and showed compassion.  The Judiciary is sometimes accused of being a little aloof.  Mr. Justice Quirke was anything but aloof.  While I could be described as the ultimate cynic, I felt strongly that he listened and cared.  For that, I must say "well done" to the Government for choosing the right man.  The Turf Cutters and Contractors Association recognises this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">The Minister gave us a little hope yesterday.  I am grateful for that because I am not in this for confrontation.  As I have stated to friends on many occasions, my ambition is to be a postman and live in a country where I can be happy with what is going on around me.  If we can solve this problem, I will take one step further to realising my ambition.  Yesterday, the Minister stated that turf cutting could possibly take place on a small number of SAC bogs where it is not currently permitted.  This approach is consistent with what the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association seeks.  All we need is a small amount of bog.  Having engaged with and listened to people all over the country at public meetings held in cold halls and having subsequently visited all the bogs in the area - Michael Fitzmaurice did most of this work - the TCCA worked out that its members would be happy to have access to just 2% of the bogs in question.  This would provide us with turf for the next 300 years.  The TCCA is agreeable to such a scenario, which means our position and that of the Government are closer together than ever.  However, for this proposal to work, the House must be united.  There is no point whingeing to the European Commission if we do not unanimously support the proposal.  That the Taoiseach will accompany us when we speak to Commission officials will be of assistance because it gives a stamp of authority and shows we are serious about this issue.  We will then have a great chance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">I plead with the Government to withdraw its amendment to ensure Deputies from all sides sing from the same hymn sheet and we are able to go to Europe united on this issue.  The Government appears to agree with every statement in the motion.  As it is already on side, we now need it to support the motion.  To do so would also strengthen its position in communities in turf cutting areas.  This is a win-win scenario for everyone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">If we can win on this issue, we will give people hope on many different issues.  Many people are living in despair for various reasons.  If they can see a little bit of hope on this issue, perhaps they will see a bit of hope for the future of the country because the Government would be agreeing with all the people on these bogs that what have said is relevant and that they matter.  That would be the first time ever that anyone officially said that they matter.  That would be amazing and that is the way to win this one.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">If the Government parties vote for the motion and we are all united on this, let no one be under any illusion that this will solve the problem.  They know this will not solve the problem but this would be the new beginning we need and, from there, we can drive forward and solve this problem.  It will not be easy.  If it was easy, we would most likely have solved it.  If we talk about the entire picture along the lines we have proposed, putting together a national plan and not talking about individual bogs or certain areas being in or out, then it could work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">We are looking for three actions to be taken and they are outlined in the motion and the amendment.  On bogs where people have good quality turf within a reasonable distance of their home, they should be allowed to relocate.  They are prepared to move because we are dealing with reasonable people.  On the bogs where turf cutters have nowhere close by to move to and there is no good quality turf, we require that they be allowed to consolidate into one area on those bogs in order that co-existence can take place.  In one case, we need complete compensatory habitat exchange.  In other words, there are so many people on that particular bog that moving them around would not make a difference because we would be just getting them to march around in a circle.  In that case, we need complete habitat exchange.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">With regard to the 2% of bogland we will use, we did not just go out and look at the bogs we owned that were under threat.  On Christmas Eve, an hour before Santa should have been arriving at our houses, Michael Fitzmaurice, our chairperson, was in Leitrim identifying a bog that was perfectly intact with no turf cutting taking place on it and with a lake in the middle of it in order that we could guarantee there would be just as many bogs designated in the end in the context of the entire picture and turf cutting could continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">The TCCA approves of conservation but we believe and now know that conservation and turf cutting can go hand in hand.  Everyone can win on this.  We need the support of the Government parties tonight and, subsequent to that, we need their support in Europe.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

        <b> Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         if he is satisfied that the Government will reach its renewable electricity targets for 2020 and if he believes that the recent decision on curtailment by the Single Electricity Market Committee in relation to curtailment will have any effect on this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_496">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_1254">The Government fully endorses the importance of the contribution of wind energy to energy security and environmental sustainability.  Under the EU Renewable Energy Directive, Ireland has a legally binding renewable energy target of 16% by 2020.  The National Renewable Energy Action Plan sets out the strategies for meeting the overall target through delivering 40% in the electricity sector, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heat sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">The latest projections from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) are that approximately 4,000 MW of renewable generation capacity will be required to achieve the electricity target, taking into account also delivery of national energy efficiency targets.  At present, there are approximately 1,900 MW of renewable generation built and fully operational.  It is necessary to double the amount of renewable generation on the system in order to meet the 2020 target.  I am confident that Ireland can meet its 2020 target.  However, given the scale of the necessary build-out required, any factor that potentially compromises the level or pace of wind energy development is a matter of serious concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">Under the existing arrangements, renewable projects currently receive payments from the wholesale electricity market in respect of both "constraints" and "curtailments".  Constraints arise where a transmission or distribution line is down for maintenance or due to some local fault.  All generation that uses the line must be "constrained" until such time as the line is operational again.  Curtailment typically arises where there is high wind at times of low system demand such as the middle of the night.  In this scenario wind projects have to be curtailed, that is turned down or off, because the system cannot handle, and does not need, the amount of generation at that particular time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">The Single Electricity Market (SEM) Committee, comprising the energy Regulators North and South and two Independent Members, is statutorily responsible for the regulation and oversight of the single electricity market.  The SEM Committee has been considering for some considerable time the future treatment of constraint and curtailment.  Following a period of consultation the SEM Committee published its decision on 21 December last in relation to both constraint and curtailment.  The terms of the Curtailment Decision took most industry stakeholders by surprise.  In the case of constraints, the Committee decided that wind projects with "firm access" (that is fully connected to the system) will receive the market compensation.  Projects without firm access as yet will be constrained down first and will not receive market compensation.  I understand that this aspect of the decision has not been widely disputed by the industry and was expected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">However despite proposing in consultation that the Committee was minded to apply the curtailment rules pro rata to both existing and new build projects, the Committee's Decision of 21 December decided that grandfathering rights would also apply in the curtailment scenario.  New projects until such time as they achieve firm grid access will be curtailed first and will not receive market compensation.  By way of background, it should be noted that most wind farms connect to the grid system a few years in advance of a firm connection date.  The grandfathering decision, as it stands, would clearly favour existing generation units deemed to have what is termed "firm connection" status.  But it places the entire burden of curtailed output on new wind farms pending fully firm connection status.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">Modelling done by industry indicates that non-firm wind farms could be affected by being turned down to a significant degree, such that the financial viability of the projects would be threatened.  The industry's view is that the decision could slow down new projects by years, putting achievement of the national 2020 target in jeopardy.  My Department has asked for a formal analysis of the impact of this decision from the Commission for Energy Regulation and also separately from EirGrid as the Market Operator and Transmission System Operator.  The SEAI is providing its own assessment of this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">Over the last 2 months my Department has met the Irish Wind Energy Association and individual companies to hear their concerns at first hand.  I welcome the fact that the SEM Committee invited industry representative associations to present their concerns and analysis to the members on 23 February.  Given the adverse reaction of most of the industry to the decision of the Committee, it was important that industry were given the opportunity to set out their position and bring additional information to the SEM Committee.  I am advised that the SEM Committee is now reflecting on those presentations by industry and an outcome to their deliberations is expected over the coming weeks.</p>

I should emphasise that the scope, terms of reference and timeline for the investigation are matters for the BAI, pursuant to Section 53 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.

ComReg also has a mandate to promote innovation and since 2005 ComReg has made radio spectrum available for research and innovation purposes under its specially designed wireless test &amp; trial licensing programme called "Test and Trial Ireland".

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_1270">I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 20 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">At the end of December 2011, EirGrid reported that there are 1605MegaWatts of onshore wind and 25MegaWatts of offshore wind connected to the grid along with 237MegaWatts of hydro power and 46MegaWatts of smaller renewable sources.  This translates to approximately 18% of national electricity consumption now being met from renewable energy sources.  Wave and tidal electricity is still at the research, development and deployment stage globally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">The latest estimate by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is that 4,000MegaWatts of renewable generation needs to be in place to meet Ireland's 2020 target of 40% renewable electricity.  On this basis some 200MegaWatts per annum of new onshore wind projects needs to be connected to the grid between now and 2020 in order to meet the target.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">It is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of the job creation impact of onshore wind projects.  Environmental impact assessments need to be undertaken where appropriate.  Planning permissions and other relevant licenses and permits need to be obtained.  Sites need to be prepared for installation, grid connections need to be constructed and foundations laid and finally turbines need to be ordered and transported to the site for installation.  All of these activities create employment opportunities.  The number of new wind projects connected in individual years has varied significantly.  There will, also, always be a level of ongoing operation and maintenance of wind farms following connection to the grid.  Most employment opportunities relating to wind farm development in Ireland are at the pre-installation, installation and commissioning stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">Ireland does not currently have a manufacturing base for large scale commercial sized turbines.  Developers assess the turbines available on the international market and make individual commercial choices.  International studies that assess the employment opportunities relating to wind energy usually focus on jobs relating to manufacturing of turbines, cables and other capital equipment.  It is not always appropriate to apply these to the Irish situation in terms of arriving at an accurate assessment of jobs created in Ireland by reference to MegaWatts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">The European Wind Energy Association published a report entitled "Wind At Work" in 2009.  This report estimated the direct employment from wind energy in companies in certain European countries in 2007 and put the figure for Ireland at 1,500.  For Ireland, the report noted that apart from wind farm developers, Ireland has a variety of companies specialising in engineering, legal services, insurance and finance.  The report concluded that 15.1 jobs are created in the EU for every MegaWatt installed, and that wind turbine and component manufacturing jobs would be a significant proportion of that.  The Irish Wind Energy Association itself published a study in 2010 entitled "Jobs and Investment in Irish Wind Energy".  This study estimates that the wind energy sector in Ireland can support 1.5 jobs per MegaWatts installed on the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">I have engaged with my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order to ensure that our Departments and agencies including SEAI, IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) work together, in exploring how Ireland can maximise job creation opportunities in the renewable energy sector.  The recent ‘Action Plan for Jobs' strategy highlights that Ireland has a number of strengths which it can leverage to create employment and growth opportunities both for indigenous companies and for foreign investment in Ireland.  These include:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1277">Excellent renewable energy resources, which raise the prospect of Ireland ultimately becoming an exporter of clean energy to Europe;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1278">A strong R&amp;D base including in the area of ICT which is highly relevant to a number of green economy opportunities;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1279">Strengths as a location to test and develop new technologies — both in terms of existing test — bed sites and taking advantage of Ireland's small size where new technologies can be tested for application to larger markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">Under the auspices of the British Irish Council and in the EU context also, the Government is committed to progressing the opportunity for renewable energy trading and the potential development of an indigenous renewable energy export sector.  In the short to medium term, opportunities may exist to engage in renewable energy trade relating to onshore and offshore wind.  Subject to technological developments and commercialisation there may also be significant potential to develop wave energy for export in the medium to longer term.

            <p eId="para_1282">I hope to meet the Western Development Commission in the very near future to discuss their Report into the benefits of national gas infrastructure for the North West.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is the statutory, independent body, charged with the assessment and licensing of prospective operators seeking to develop and operate a gas distribution system within the State.  I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">The CER, in 2006, approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">Under the CER's policy framework, Bord Gáis Networks, and latterly Gaslink carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  Gaslink published its New Towns Analysis Phase 3<i/>  report in 2010.  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region which are the focus of the Western Development Commission paper, “Why Invest in Gas”.  However, the Gaslink review found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">Gaslink will continue to regularly review the towns which did not qualify for connection under the 2010 Study as well as other towns.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p>

            <p eId="para_1287">The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  The Programme for Government commits to widespread availability of high speed broadband.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I convened last summer, has an important role to play in this regard.  It comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss and report on policy issues and proposals in relation to the provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.  I expect that the Taskforce will help to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.  The Taskforce will conclude its deliberations very shortly.  It is my intention to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce submit the Report to Government and to publish it immediately thereafter.  I anticipate that the Report of the Taskforce and the commitment in the Programme for Government will provide the basis for an optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">Accordingly, following publication of the Taskforce report, I intend to consult with other stakeholders before moving quickly to publish a National Next Generation Broadband Plan.  The Plan will set out the Government's intentions with regard to any investment or actions required to facilitate the roll-out of Next Generation Broadband.  The level of any State intervention required, in the form of financial resources or fiscal incentives will not become clear until after: (i) the Government decides what interventions, if any, are appropriate; (ii) due consideration is given to the various options; and (iii) the preferred options are identified.</p>

            <p eId="para_1294">Standard Exploration Licence 2/11 was granted last year to a consortium comprising Providence Resources Plc and Star Energy Oil and Gas Ltd over an area of approximately 380 square kilometres in the Kish Bank Basin off the coast of Dalkey, County Dublin.  The exploration licence is for a six year period with an obligation to drill an exploration well during the first three years.  Exploration activity under this licence is at an early stage and it is far too early to anticipate a discovery that might lead to a petroleum production project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">While there is no legal obligation on exploration companies to sell oil or gas discovered in the Irish offshore into the Irish market, this is consistent with international practice.  A combination of practical factors and market forces would dictate that where a local demand exists, a commercial discovery of natural gas, that is to be processed onshore, will be landed and sold locally to ensure maximum recovery of gas from the gas field and to avoid attracting the cost of transport tariffs. It is also worth noting that the Interconnectors between Scotland and Ireland are not currently engineered for reverse flow.  In relation to a possible future oil discovery, the factors which will influence the development alternatives and a decision on where to land the oil will include the size of the discovery, the nature of the oil and where it could be refined.</p>

            <p eId="para_1298">I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 29 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for overseeing electricity network expenditure and in that regard, ensuring cost effectiveness and efficiency of the investment programmes of EirGrid as well as ESB Networks.  The cost of investment in the networks is remunerated through charges on all electricity consumers, in line with the regulatory model worldwide, and is not a charge on the taxpayer.  The CER examines in detail the capital investment plans of EirGrid in the context of revenue determinations and monitors the plans on an ongoing basis.  The latest transmission capital spend review undertaken by the CER was for the period 2011 to 2015 and the outcome of that review is publicly available on the CER's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">The powers and responsibilities of EirGrid, as the independent transmission system operator are set out in the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, and a number of statutory instruments including (SI) No. 445 of 2000 and (SI) No. 60 of 2005.  Under (SI) No. 445 of 2000, EirGrid has the statutory obligation to "develop a safe, secure, reliable, economical and efficient electricity transmission system with a view to ensuring that all reasonable demands for electricity are met and having due regard for the environment".  Moreover, under (SI) No. 60 of 2005, EirGrid has the duty "to plan the long term ability of the transmission system to meet reasonable demands for the transmission of electricity".</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">The North-South transmission line is vital infrastructure for the island. The lack of sufficient interconnection between the North and South is preventing the full benefits of the all-island market being realised for consumers.  The continued absence of the transmission line is costing the economies and consumers, North and South, up to €30 million every year, since without it, the electricity system is more inefficient from an operational perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">The case for the transmission line was assessed in detail by the Regulators North and South in 2004.  Their assessment included a range of technical and economic studies including NPV analysis.  The results of this assessment are included in their ‘Joint Report on the Case for a Second North South Interconnector'.  This published report includes reference to specific cost savings in the range of €2.3m to €18.9m per annum.  There is also a range of benefits, which formed part of the Regulators' criteria in their decision making.  These included security of supply, renewable facilitation and increased competitiveness in the all island electricity market.  These benefits are significant and strategic criteria which form part of the overall economic and technical case for the transmission line.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">Completion of the North South project will further consolidate the all-island electricity market established in 2007, providing for the seamless transfer of electricity across the island, delivering greater competition, reducing the need for further investment in thermal generation and ensuring the availability of low cost generation to the market.</p>

            <p eId="para_1306">The Irish average mobile termination charge has reduced from 8.03 cent per minute as of 1 July 2010 to approximately 4.3 cent per minute as of 31 December 2011, representing a 46% cumulative reduction over that period.  The current mobile termination charge of approximately 4.3 cent per minute is in line with the European average.  Mobile termination charges will see further reductions from 30 June 2012.  ComReg has commenced a consultation process to determine future mobile termination charges in Ireland and a final decision is due in 2012.  This will determine mobile termination charges from January 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_1308">Ireland's telecommunications market has been open to competition since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Despite the current economic difficulties, significant private sector investment continues to be made in the provision of broadband products and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">The State is not a provider of services, except in instances of clear market failure such as in the cases of both the National and Rural Broadband Schemes.  Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid clearance to ensure no unacceptable level of market distortion takes place.  Between these private and public investments, at least a basic broadband service is now available right throughout the country including to SMEs.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on ComReg's website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission’s “Digital Agenda for Europe” target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.

            <p eId="para_1316">Following detailed analysis which identified a range of complex regulatory and legislative issues the Government has decided not to proceed with a sale of a minority stake in ESB as previously signalled.  The Government has decided that alternative asset disposal options will now be pursued, to include the sale of Bord Gáis Éireann's Energy business (but not including BGE's gas transmission or distribution systems or the two gas interconnectors, which will remain in State ownership); and some of ESB's non-strategic power generation capacity.  The Government has reaffirmed its commitment to the retention of ESB as a vertically integrated utility of strategic importance in State ownership.

            <p eId="para_1319">There is potential for Ireland to enjoy both economic and energy security benefits from its indigenous oil and gas resources.  These benefits will only be realised through effective exploration.  Ireland has a policy of actively encouraging investment by relevant companies   in exploration for oil and gas, both offshore and onshore.  Where exploration or production takes place, it is subject to a robust regulatory framework, with a clear objective of ensuring that all exploration and production activities are carried out in a safe manner and do not harm the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">I am very conscious that there are people who have concerns, which have been strongly expressed that use of the technology known as hydraulic fracturing in exploration and production activities, could have a negative impact on the environment.  The principal concerns that have been expressed relate to the production phase of a project and environmental considerations arising from the large number of production wells that would be hydraulically fractured.  In February of last year, my Department granted onshore Licensing Options to three companies over parts of the Lough Allen and Clare Basin respectively.  The Licensing Options are preliminary authorisations and are different to exploration licences.  The Options are for a two year period from 1 March 2011.  During this period, the companies will evaluate the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on studies of existing data.  Exploration drilling is not permitted under these authorisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">While it is too early to say if any of the three existing onshore licensing options will progress to the exploration phase, let alone to a production phase, I would like to set out in summary terms, for the information of the House, the regulatory framework that would apply in Ireland in the case of a shale gas production project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">The framework that would apply is the framework that is already in use in the case of a range of major strategic infrastructure projects.  Under that framework a developer would require consents from An Bord Pleanála, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  All of these consent authorities have a statutory obligation to consider the potential environmental impact of any proposed petroleum production project.  All of these processes are subject to EU environmental Directives, including the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">A safety permit would also be required from the Commission for Energy Regulation prior to the commencement of any licensed activities or the operation of any associated infrastructure pursuant to the requirements of the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act 2010.  The policy approach is, therefore, one of encouraging investment in exploration, while ensuring all exploration and production activities are carried out in a safe manner and without harming the environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1325">The Better Energy programme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department.  The Better Energy: Homes scheme provides support to homeowners towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades including solar thermal with the works being undertaken by privately appointed contractors.  Window replacement works are not currently eligible for support.  The measures were selected for inclusion in Better Energy:  Homes as they were deemed most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners, at least relative cost, and would thereby optimise the use of Exchequer funds while at the same time maximising the opportunities for homeowner participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">Under the Better Energy: Workplaces grant scheme operated by the SEAI on behalf of my Department, commercial and public sector organisations may include the upgrade of windows in an application for funding.  However, it should be noted that this scheme is a highly competitive one and that not all eligible projects will necessarily qualify for support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">As part of the Better Energy programme, 2012 will see the involvement of energy suppliers in meeting their energy savings targets agreed as part of their Voluntary Agreements with the SEAI.  A range of energy efficiency measures currently qualify for energy credits towards those targets including insulation and heating upgrades as well as high performance windows.  I am further informed by the SEAI that high performance glazing replacement in existing window frames will shortly qualify for credits.  The availability of credits for specific measures will stimulate energy suppliers to promote the uptake of these measures more widely, as a means of achieving their targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">I am advised that grants for window replacement are available to those over 60 under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, operated by local authorities on behalf of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This means-tested scheme provides grants to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out to their homes.  Eligible works include structural repairs or improvements, re-wiring, repairs to or replacement of windows and doors, provision of water supply and sanitary facilities, provision of heating, cleaning and painting.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_1330">There has been significant growth in the take up of broadband services and contracted speeds in Ireland in recent years.  The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) has reported that between Q3 2007 and Q3 2011 the number of broadband subscribers has more than doubled from 793,000 to more than 1.6 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">It is also the case that, at the end of September 2011, 73.2% of domestic customers and 88.8% of business subscribers were contracted for services using speeds between 2Mbps-10Mbps compared to 52.5% and 30.3% respectively at end 2007, when ComReg commenced reporting in the current format.  Many subscribers are also migrating to higher speed products with 19.8% of residential subscribers using speeds in excess of 10Mbps, according to ComReg's latest Quarterly Report (Q3 2011), compared to 0.2% at end 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">International comparisons of broadband services are complex to measure and interpret.  In many instances, surveys measure an average of retail broadband speeds published on service providers' websites only.  These comparisons do not take account of higher speeds which are available in some countries (including Ireland) over leased lines to users of very high speeds and bandwidth.  The international comparisons only consider retail services that are advertised.  Big bandwidth leased line services are not advertised as retail services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">It is also the case that the comparisons are not weighted to take account of the number and variety of speed options advertised.  Furthermore, broadband services that are advertised as part of a bundled package may not be included in such comparisons.  Commonly used high speed broadband services, available in Ireland, such as triple play products, may not be included in some international comparisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce which I convened last summer has an important role to play in this regard.  It comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss and report on policy issues and proposals in relation to the provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.  I expect that the Taskforce will help to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">The Taskforce will conclude its deliberations shortly.  It is my intention to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce and to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.</p>

            <p eId="para_1337">The Programme for Government includes a commitment to roll out a Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) retrofit scheme after 2013, to replace the Exchequer funding currently being provided to the Better Energy Programme.  The PAYS concept is an innovative financing mechanism that would allow consumers to finance upgrades using the money that they would have spent on their energy bill.  Such a scheme can also be used to stimulate investments in energy efficiency in non-domestic buildings and premises.  My Department has established a project team to undertake the necessary technical and financial analysis of a PAYS model in the Irish context which will inform my proposals to the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1338">There are considerable complexities involved in the development of the PAYS scheme, which is requiring comprehensive consultation with all energy suppliers, including Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ).  I do not envisage that the prospective disposal of BGÉ‘s Energy business, announced as part of the Government's State Assets Programme will have any impact on the PAYS model.  All energy suppliers whether State or privately owned will be involved in the scheme.</p>

         the steps he is taking to reduce energy costs and support renewable energy.

            <p eId="para_1340">I have no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated sector.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  The electricity retail market is fully deregulated as of April 2011.  As a result, business and domestic customers can avail of the competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">The CER is engaged in progressive deregulation of the gas retail market.  The only remaining regulated segment of the gas market is that of residential customers supplied by Bord Gáis Energy.  Gas customers can avail of competitive offerings from other suppliers.  Competition helps to put downward pressure on energy prices.  The Government remains concerned to ensure that additional actions are taken, where feasible, to mitigate energy costs for business and domestic customers in the interests of competitiveness, employment and for the economy as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">Ireland's energy prices are currently in line with, or below, European averages.  This is confirmed by Eurostat figures for the first half of 2011 which shows electricity prices moving towards convergence with the EU average.  Electricity prices in Ireland were below the EU average for all medium to large business customers for the first half of 2011, ranging from 10% to 17% below.  During the same period, prices for business gas consumers remained below the EU average for most consumption levels ranging from 4% to 25% below.  I am committed to continuing to work with the enterprise community, the energy sector, and the energy regulator to ensure that the costs of energy for business are as competitive as possible through all measures at our disposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">In terms of supporting renewable energy, Ireland is legally obliged under Directive 2009/28/EC to increase consumption of renewables to 16% by 2020.  The National Renewable Energy Action  Plan sets out the planned trajectory for achieving the target across the electricity, heat and transport sectors with 40% needed in electricity, 10% in transport and 12% in heat to meet Ireland's overall 16% commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">Renewable energy is being supported by a variety of policy initiatives.  Renewable electricity is now the largest contributor to renewable energy consumption and is expected to contribute most to our 2020 target.  The largest contribution in the electricity sector is expected to be made through generation from wind technologies, followed by biomass technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">For the support of commercial renewable generation, my Department administers a renewable energy support mechanism known as the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT).  The terms and conditions of REFIT are available on the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources website.  A new REFIT scheme for biomass technologies (REFIT 3) was opened in February by my Department and a further new REFIT scheme for onshore wind, small hydro and landfill gas (REFIT 2) is due to be opened later this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346">Wind generation will provide the bulk of Ireland's renewable energy in 2020.  To meet the RES-E target, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has estimated that 4000MW of renewable generation needs to be connected to the electricity grid. At end 2011, EirGrid data shows that there was 1900MW of installed renewable generation, including 1630MW of wind.  The Government is proactively engaged in discussions with the UK, under the British Irish Council, on developing the cooperation mechanisms under Directive 2009/28/EC for renewable trading purposes.  Ireland's significant offshore renewable energy potential offers undoubted opportunities for renewable export.  The prospect also of realising onshore wind projects of scale for export markets is also being actively explained.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347">In the transport sector, the biofuels obligation introduced in 2010 under the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010   requires transport fuel suppliers to provide a specified amount of their sales in the form of biofuels.  The obligation currently stands at 4% by volume which is equivalent to 3% in energy terms.  The biofuel obligation will incrementally increase on a sustainable basis to 2020, to meet the RES-T target of 10% in 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1348">Due to the cost of transporting heat, heat is generally consumed at the point of generation to maximise efficiency.  The new biomass REFIT for electricity exported to the grid provides for up to 310MW of new biomass generation to be constructed.  This will stimulate the production of renewable heat by improving the financial viability of many more potential sites.</p>

            <p eId="para_1350">As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is responsible for the international promotion of Irish culture under the Arts Act 2003.  This is primarily accomplished through Culture Ireland which operates under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  My Department works closely with Culture Ireland, both at headquarters level and through the Embassy network, to promote our culture.  This close working relationship is reflected in the fact that a senior official of my Department serves in an <i>ex officio</i> capacity on the board of Culture Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also manages a grant-in-aid for cultural relations with other countries.  This allows for modest funding to be provided for cultural activity by the Embassy network.  Every effort is made to leverage further promotional benefits from such spending, complementary to the activity of Culture Ireland.  This was done very effectively in relation to the Imagine Ireland initiative in the United States during 2011, which saw a celebration of Irish arts, with 1,200 artists participating in five hundred events in over forty of the US States.  Imagine Ireland featured very close co-operation between Culture Ireland, my Department and our Embassy and Consulates General in the United States. In total last year, we funded 258 cultural projects across the globe involving 58 of our missions from the Embassy network through the grant-in-aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">During the past year, a new travelling exhibition on the life and works of W.B. Yeats, based on the National Library's original exhibition, was also financed from my Department's cultural grant-in-aid. This Yeats exhibition has been produced in eight languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish) and with the active engagement of our Embassy network it has already toured more than 50 cities in 14 countries.  My Department and Culture Ireland both support financially the programme of the Irish Cultural Centre in Paris.  The Centre is managed by the <i>Fondation Irlandaise</i>, a Franco-Irish organisation, and the Ambassador of Ireland to France is actively involved in its activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1353">I would add, finally, that Culture Ireland is the Irish member of the European Union National Institutes for Culture (EUNIC) and, in a further reflection of the close co-operation between that agency and my Department, the relevant Embassy or Consulate represents Culture Ireland when appropriate at EUNIC meetings overseas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1357">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their tax compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow/hidden economy. Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow/hidden economy through its range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects. Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue's assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">Revenue is using a wide range of methodologies to identify those operating in the shadow/hidden economy and is deploying the full range of compliance interventions. Activities can include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre-arranged aspect queries on specific items.   There is no doubt that shadow/hidden economy activity creates distortions in the economy and competitive disadvantages for compliant businesses. For these reasons, Revenue focuses on deterring shadow/hidden economy activity and non-compliance through its audit and investigation programmes based on risk analysis, use of Revenue powers and their intelligence and information systems. Last year Revenue carried out 11,066 audits resulting in a yield of €440.46 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their approach to the shadow economy is underpinned by close consultation and cooperation with the Department of Social Protection. The primary objective of these activities is to uncover either non-declaration   or under-declaration of income and/or fraudulent DSP claims.  The Deputy will be aware of the continuing strengthening of legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax and duty evasion.  Finance Bill 2012, currently before the Oireachtas, contains provisions in relation to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1360">The making of returns of transactions by merchant acquirers, and other payment settlement entities, to the Revenue Commissioners (from 2010);</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1361">The more effective investigation of white-collar crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">The Bill also contains a comprehensive package of measures in relation to Excise (Oils) including, requirement for separate licences for auto-fuel traders and marked fuel traders, requirement to have a separate licence for every premises or place at which the fuel concerned is dealt in, and a requirement that a licence must be clearly displayed at the premises or place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">Regulations were also introduced in 2011 providing for the supply of details to the Revenue Commissioners of payments made by Government Departments and State Bodies. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this data is matched to the Revenue records of the various recipients, and is used to profile risk. Similar matching is also carried out using other third party data received by the Revenue Commissioners.  Revenue has a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in order to inform the approaches they are taking and help determine where resources may best be deployed, they have engaged on a series of meetings with trade and representative bodies. Increasingly they are finding that bodies and individuals are prepared to share insights and specific information with Revenue with regard to shadow economy activity in times of recession. Revenue is deepening their engagement with the representative bodies and has set up regional shadow economy liaison groups.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1366">The Government considers that the best means to improve consumer confidence is to restore sustainability to the public finances, repair the banking system and return the economy to sustainable growth.  Effectively addressing these three areas will result in increased employment, investment and consumer spending and will be key in driving this country forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">Looking more specifically at what the Government is doing to restore sustainability to the public finances, we have met all our fiscal targets to date and are on track to meet future targets under the Programme of External Financial Assistance. Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that in the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement, the Government set out the required fiscal adjustment path over the medium term.  This will provide Irish citizens with greater certainty regarding the magnitude of future budgetary adjustment measures and, in doing so, will help to improve confidence among households.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">In terms of repairing the banking sector, the Irish banking system has been recapitalised to a very high level and has undergone significant restructuring to make it fit for purpose.  The Government has imposed lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Progress on these lending targets is monitored by the Credit Review Office (CRO) and by my Department.  Additionally, the CRO ensures that the pillar banks do not refuse credit to viable businesses, both by its existence and by offering the right to a review of refusals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">With regard to returning the economy to sustainable growth, we have seen significant improvements in our competitiveness.  In terms of the labour market, we have targeted our limited firepower in more labour-intensive sectors, with measures contained in the Jobs Initiative and the recent Action Plan on Jobs.  Indeed, figures published this morning show the first quarterly increase in employment in four years in the final quarter of last year.  While the increase was relatively small, at least we are moving in the right direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">While consumer confidence is important, I think that it is crucial that we do not ignore investor confidence, a large part of which reflects our international reputation.  The Deputy will be aware that the IDA recently announced that a record number of new investments were won last year.  Indeed, the FDI pipeline looks positive.  We have also taken a number of steps at a more micro-level to support job creation and return confidence to entrepreneurs including the extension of  three year corporation tax exemption for new start up companies and enhancing the R&amp;D tax credit.  Overall, I think we have seen that Government policies, both domestic and at EU level, are helping to improve confidence among consumers and investors.</p>

        <b> Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance with regard to Article 5 of</b>
         the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism, which makes the granting of financial assistance in the framework of new programmes under the ESM conditional upon ratification of the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, if Irish representatives at the negotiations of the ESM treaty and the stability treaty sought to influence this article in any way; if he supported or opposed its inclusion; the justification for this position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1372">The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty, which was signed by all Euro Area Member States on 2 February, subject to ratification, provides "that the granting of financial assistance in the framework of new programmes under the ESM will be conditional, as of 1 March 2013, on the ratification of the TSCG by the ESM Member concerned" and on implementation of the balanced budget rule as specified in the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union within the agreed timeline (one year after entry into force of the latter).  This reflects the outcome of discussions in which Ireland participated actively and constructively. In this context, I would point out that the existence of the ESM as a safety net is in Europe's interest and in Ireland's interest.  We do not expect to need recourse to ESM assistance — our programme is working and we are on course to return to market funding as envisaged by the end of the programme period in 2013.  However, the existence of the ESM is important in supporting market confidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">The linkage between the ESM and the ratification of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary was accepted in the context of the acceleration into force of the ESM by July 2012. It was of particular importance to a number of partners. It is entirely logical and reasonable that a country receiving the support of its partners under the ESM should be prepared to run sensible budgetary policies as required under the new Treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">I have clarified that the linkage of both the ESM Treaty and the Intergovernmental Treaty refers to new applications for assistance under the ESM and will not affect the transfer to the ESM of undisbursed amounts under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) for Ireland and other programme countries. The funding approved under the existing Programme of Financial Support for Ireland is not therefore conditional on Ireland ratifying the fiscal compact but, as is currently the case, on Ireland successfully implementing our programme.  Primary legislation will be required to enable Ireland to ratify the ESM Treaty and implement it.</p>

         if a person who agreed a purchase price for a house in November 2008, paid a deposit on the purchase of a house on 5 December 2008, drew down a mortgage on the property in March 2009 which is now in serious negative equity and struggling to pay their mortgage is entitled to the increased rate of mortgage interest relief as announced in budget 2012 for the benefit of householders in serious negative equity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1376">The position is as I stated in my Budget day speech, that the Government has now fulfilled its commitment contained in the programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first-time buyers who took out their first mortgage in the period 2004 to 2008.    I have sought to be as flexible as possible within the constraints pertaining.  Under the current tax legislation mortgage interest relief is granted from the date the first mortgage interest payment is made.   The legislation is being amended for this particular measure to also include mortgage draw-down as a qualifying event for the rate increase.  This means that a mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or   if they drew down their mortgage in that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">Therefore, an individual who paid a deposit on the purchase of a house in December 2008 but drew down their mortgage in 2009 will not qualify for the increased relief.  However, they should be able to claim relief at the non-increased rates which depend on whether they are first time buyers or not.

            <p eId="para_1380">I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 41 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">As the Deputy is aware the day-to-day operation of the bank is a matter for the Board of the bank. PQ 31 of 22 February 2012 was interpreted to inquire about the Minister's involvement in the approval of the engagement referred to in the question. In reply, it was indicated that no notice requiring the Minister's approval was received as in the particular circumstances this was not required. This is not to say that the Department, through ongoing communication with IBRC, were not aware of considerations by the bank to engage the company referred to in the question. In order to clarify the situation for the Deputy I asked my Department to review the documentation to provide greater clarity on the order of events leading up to the bank's engagement with the advisors referred to in the question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">Firstly, the Board of the bank was advised, by management in September 2011 of the proposed engagement of the company referred to. It was further noted in the Board papers that it was not proposed to engage in a formal procurement process given the sensitivity of the engagement. This approach is provided for in the bank's own procurement policy. These papers became available to my Department immediately in advance of the Board meeting on 27 October. These papers are provided for information only, and are not, in normal course, regarded as requiring action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">At a meeting with my Department on 1 November 2011 the Bank, as part of on-going communications, noted that it intended to appoint the advisors referred to in the question by end week for a period of five weeks subject to appropriate conflict and confidentiality protection. There was no request for Ministerial consent under the Relationship Framework as the bank deemed the appointment to be ordinary course of business.  Based on a review of minutes and also on information received informally, my Department issued a letter to the Bank's chairman on 18 November 2011 seeking assurances in relation to conflict protection with regard to the proposed engagement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">In a meeting with the Chairman on 24 November it was indicated that the Bank were close to appointing the company referred to and that under the terms of the engagement. It was also indicated that the Company would not be precluded from bidding in the event that it was decided to take the assets to market. The Bank also indicated that any subsequent competition disposal process would be the subject of a competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">In response to the 18 November 2011 letter from my Department, the bank's Chairman, in a letter dated 30 November, provided confirmation that FTI had been retained to carry out an independent assessment of the advisor's compliance framework and to validate the Bank's reliance on the integrity of the advisor's Chinese wall structures.  The Chairman further noted that the appointment of the advisors for a 3 month engagement was imminent and also that the Bank had made it clear to the advisors that any strategy choices arising from the Advisory work would be the subject of an open and transparent process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">We were subsequently informed that the agreement between IBRC and the company referred to was signed by the bank on the 2 December 2011. There was no, and nor was there a requirement for, formal notification to the Department that this agreement had been signed. A weekly conference call was subsequently initiated with the first conference call taking place on the 16 December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">It is clear that the Deputy has concerns in relation to the appointment by IBRC of this company. I have sought here to clarify the timeline and information available to my Department. If the Deputy has further information or requires further clarification I would be happy to address the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1389">The information which the Deputy requests is set out in the table.   In regards to Government debt, the General Government debt is the standard measurement of gross indebtedness used for comparative purposes within the EU and, as such, is often expressed as a percentage of GDP. Historical figures for the General Government debt back to 1970 are not available as the harmonised methodology for calculating the General Government debt was only agreed in the mid-1990s.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">The Deputy has asked for total Government debt as a percentage of GDP, but he may be interested to know that historical figures for the National Debt, which is a narrower measurement than General Government debt, excluding, amongst other things, local government borrowing, are available in the Budget and Economic Statistics on my Department's website.</p>

I am allowing schools to re-employ teachers who retired between 1 December 2011 and 29 February 2012, and who had been teaching classes due to sit State exams in 2012, until the end of the school year. In the case of teachers who are not teaching exam classes, replacements can be employed until the end of the school year, subject to the numbers framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">The Government has prioritised, as best as possible, the filling of front-line posts in the Education sector within the constraints of the Employment Control Framework. For example, schools are permitted to fill teaching vacancies that arise within their approved staffing allocations. I am confident that the large pool of qualified and registered teachers will be in a position to continue to provide high quality education to students.</p>

        <b> Deputy Mattie McGrath</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b>
         the amount of money that has been spent on refurbishment and extension works for small schools, four teachers and less, per year, per county, per size of school for the past ten years; his views that forcing the amalgamation or closure of such schools would be a waste of taxpayers’ money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1763">The expenditure information on refurbishment and extension works is not readily available within my Department and it would require a very substantial amount of administrative time to identify and extract the full range of details sought. The level of resources required to compile the information sought would not be warranted. Should the Deputy require information on a particular school I would be glad to provide it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">However, I wish to advise the Deputy that the decision making authority for any amalgamation belongs to the Patron of a school, subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills. My Department's role is to facilitate any such proposal or discussions between the relevant parties. The initiative for an amalgamation may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, Board of Management and Patron. I have said on several occasions that any decisions to amalgamate schools will be voluntary and follow decisions taken at a local level. The financial consequences associated with amalgamations would also have to take into account the continuing requirement to manage expenditure within the context of overall educational policy and the level of budgetary provision available at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">It is worth noting that there are 3,200 primary schools across Ireland. Approximately, one third of those schools has less than 86 pupils and, as a result, has far lower average class sizes. For example, a two teacher school with 32 pupils has an average class size of 1 teacher for 16 pupils. In contrast, a typical 10 teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils. In that regard, the existing staffing schedule acts as a disincentive for small schools to consider amalgamations. At a time of great strain in our public finances, we have to ensure that the very valuable but limited resources available for the education system are used in the best way possible.</p>

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_527">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1767">As I outlined to this House previously, the issues raised in the correspondence in question are many and varied. They relate to the teaching of Maths and the qualifications of Maths teachers.  The correspondent makes some interesting points and statements, many of which, however, I would not support. I do not propose in this statement to address each of these considerations. Rather, I will provide an overview of just some recent developments aimed at improving mathematics education in Ireland, particularly at second-level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">Prior to the OECD's PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) study steps were already being taken by my Department to improve the educational outcomes of our students in Maths.  The proportion of Mathematics teachers without a major qualification represents a challenge to the system, however, this is also a feature of education systems in other jurisdictions. For example, the Project Maths Implementation Group report of June 2010 states that Finland, Canada and Australia, (which ranked 2nd, 6th and 8th respectively in mathematics out of 57 countries in the 2006 OECD PISA (Programme of International Student Assessment)) have 32%, 75% and 28% respectively of students taught by certified teachers without mathematics as a major qualification.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">Last September proposals were announced by Minister Sherlock to introduce a course for teachers of Mathematics who may not have a qualification in the subject to up skill to the recognised levels. The tendering competition is now over and the assessment process is at an advanced stage. Arising out of this competitive process, I hope that there will be a contract and course/s in place in time for the forthcoming school year. The course/s will aim to provide teachers with suitable mathematical content knowledge along with appropriate pedagogical strategies in line with the Project Maths initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">The provision of the training programme addresses the following recommendation of the Report of the Project Maths Implementation Support Group: "The Department of Education and Skills should work towards ensuring that all post primary students at all levels are taught mathematics solely by teachers who hold a qualification in mathematics by 2018. Post graduate courses for existing teachers should be provided on a scale and level commensurate with this objective."  It will provide unqualified maths teachers with the opportunity to up skill their knowledge of mathematics and study the strategies best suited to the new Project Maths syllabuses. Providing for high quality teaching and learning of mathematics is of key strategic importance to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">Project Maths itself is a major programme of reform in mathematics in second level schools, which is designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics, to reinforce its practical relevance to everyday life, and to ensure better continuity between primary and second level, and junior and senior cycle. It began in 24 project schools in September 2008 and was introduced in all schools in September 2010.  The curriculum will be phased in over a number of years covering the following five strands of mathematics:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1772">Phase 1: Strand 1 — statistics and probability; Strand 2 — geometry and trigonometry.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1773">Phase 2: Strand 3 — number; Strand 4 — algebra.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1774">Phase 3: Strand 5 — functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">In tandem with the roll-out a comprehensive programme of professional development is being provided for teachers of mathematics. Support is provided on a rolling basis as each strand of the curriculum is implemented, and will continue until at least 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">In addition, schools have been asked to attend to the following measures which are supportive of enhanced mathematics learning:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1777">to make every effort to ensure that students have access to a mathematics class every day, particularly in junior cycle;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1778">that Transition Year, where available, should be used to provide innovative learning opportunities and increased mathematics teaching hours to develop core transferable skills;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1779">that every effort should be made to deploy teachers who hold a qualification in mathematics to mathematics teaching, which is particularly important in the formative years of junior cycle;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1780">to provide optimum support and encouragement to as many students as possible who have taken higher-level mathematics in junior cycle to continue to study the subject at higher level in senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">An additional 25 bonus CAO points will be available from 2012 to candidates who score Grade D3 or higher in Higher Level Mathematics in the Leaving Certificate examination. These arrangements have been agreed by higher education institutions for a four year trial period from 2012 to 2015 inclusive, with a review in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">In relation to appropriate mathematics qualifications, the Teaching Council is currently working on a process of consultation about the undergraduate degree requirements for all post-primary subjects, including Mathematics. The Deputy's correspondent may have taken this opportunity to engage with the Council on this matter which he has obviously considered in detail. My Department has also passed his correspondence on to the Council in the past. The Teaching Council will consider all feedback prior to finalising the criteria.  It is anticipated that the effect of the combined efforts of my Department, the Teaching Council, maths teachers and other stakeholders will result in better educational outcomes in Maths for our students.</p>

            <p eId="para_1784">As outlined to the Deputy in previous replies, the work of calculating pension benefit entitlements and enabling the smooth transition to pension of the large number of teachers who have retired at this time is the priority for officials in the Pension Unit of my Department and this work will continue for the next number of weeks.  While the 29 February 2012 has passed the final number of teachers in Primary, Secondary, Community and Comprehensive schools who have actually retired will not be available until all the retirement applications have been fully processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">The number of teachers who applied to retire in the period 1 January to 29 February 2012 is 1,166. Information received from the Vocational Education Sector indicates that 220 teachers have applied to retire in that sector during that period. It is important to note that schools may fill vacancies arising from retirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">As you are aware a circular was issued by my Department, in July, 2011 requesting School Boards of Management to inform all staff in their schools (who are members of an occupation pension scheme) who intended to retire on or before 29 February 2012 that they were required to give 3 calendar months' notice of their date of retirement.  The circular also stated that a notification may not be withdrawn on or after the date indicated as the last day of service. Some teachers availed of the option to withdraw their applications up to and including the 29 February, 2012. It was pointed out in that circular that failure to give the required notice could result in a delay in payment of pension benefits and in some cases teachers have not given the required notice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">When the work of processing pension benefits for those retiring has been addressed work will commence on compiling detailed statistical data on the number of teachers who retired and to publish this information on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_1789">There is no increase in the staffing schedule general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level. However, there is a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools. As part of the Budget decisions announced, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. The schools concerned are those with four or less classroom teachers. The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">This Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities. They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape. However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times. The teachers in small schools cannot be immune from the requirement that is being asked of all public servants to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure. They will not lose their classroom post if any of them are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term. The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department's Staffing Circular that is now published on my Department's website. The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the Staffing Appeals Board is 23 March, 2012.</p>

Schools do not need to apply for new connections. Decisions concerning connections are made on the basis the most economically advantageous solution for each school as per procurement rules.  Early indications are that there should be a significant reduction in those schools reliant on slower connections.</p>

            <p eId="para_1798">The reality of the economic situation and the public expenditure corrections which must be made in the coming years present challenges across all areas of public expenditure, including higher education. Moreover, the projected growth in demand for higher education over the next two decades creates further challenges for funding. Careful planning and consideration of available evidence will allow us to develop policy options so that the system can meet those challenges in the difficult years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">At my request the Higher Education Authority (HEA) completed an initial study late last year on sustainability of the current funding system for higher education. The HEA report outlines the scale of recent reductions in funding and growth in student numbers, and provides some evidence on the possible impacts of this on quality of provision. However, the HEA has emphasised that the report is preliminary only and that substantial additional work now needs to be undertaken before comprehensive proposals as to how we can sustainably fund higher education into the future can be developed. The HEA is continuing its work in this area and further advice is expected later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1803">The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The relevant appointment and retention figures for mainstream staffing for the coming school year have been published on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">However, the staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of other budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. The reform of the allocation process is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools so there will inevitably be some schools that will lose posts and some schools that will gain posts. The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule Staffing Circular 0007/2012  that is now published on my Department's website.

            <p eId="para_1806">The Deputy will be aware that, in the context of the necessary but difficult expenditure reduction measures announced in Budget 2012, new students entering postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will not be entitled to maintenance payments under the Student Grant Scheme.  However, those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the Student Grant Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">Existing postgraduate students will not be affected.  In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a €2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees. My Department estimates that this will help an additional 4,000 postgraduate students. There will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold. The income threshold for this level of grant is currently being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">In access terms, the requirement to pay a fee is considered to be a greater obstacle to entry than lack of maintenance support at postgraduate level. This is why I opted to maintain the fee-payment ahead of maintenance payments for postgraduate students.  My priority as Minister for Education and Skills is to preserve access to undergraduate higher education courses despite the difficult circumstances in our public finances. As a result, no changes were made to the eligibility criteria for undergraduate students in the recent Budget. It is also worth emphasising that 41% of all undergraduate students currently receive a grant and pay no student contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">In relation to the way that these financial supports may be accessed, all new student grant applications from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will be dealt with by the new single grant awarding authority, Student Universal Support Ireland (a division of City of Dublin VEC).  Students will be able to access the online application facility through <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i> to have their eligibility for a grant assessed. In the case of the renewal of applications for existing grant-holders, students should continue to apply to their local authority or Vocational Education Committee in the area where they live.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">In addition to the above means-tested supports, this year my Department is providing some €38 million to support research activities across a range of programmes, including schemes managed by the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) and the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET). These schemes specifically focus on providing funding support to postgraduate students and early-career post doctoral fellows. It is anticipated that the Councils will make over 300 new postgraduate awards this year, which is an increase on the previous year. These awards include funding for tuition fees and an annual stipend of €16,000. Funding is also available from other research funding agencies, including Science Foundation Ireland. Additionally, places are being made available free-of-charge on postgraduate courses across the country to unemployed people under my Department's Springboard initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">The Student Assistance Fund will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need. Tax relief is also available on postgraduate tuition fees.</p>

            <p eId="para_1840">I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 62 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">The staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year are set out in Primary Circular 0007/2012 which is available on my Department's website. This includes the detail of the reform of the allocation process which is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools.  The new arrangements incorporate a long overdue updating of the GAM (learning support) allocation for all schools. This inevitably involves changes to existing clustering arrangements whereby a teacher is shared between schools. A further change is that schools in any locality are being empowered to cluster and arrange their GAM resources in a manner that best suits their local needs. This should be completed by schools by 16 March.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">There are also new and separate arrangements for how resource hours for individual pupils are converted into teaching posts in schools. The requirement for resource hours in a school varies from year to year depending on the number, if any, of its pupils with autism etc. Small schools generally have a lower requirement for resource hours. The new arrangements take account of the later timescale for the allocation of these hours necessitated by individual assessment by the NCSE. All of the changes are designed to enable a more efficient operation of the teacher redeployment and recruitment and to reduce the impact of travel time between schools where teachers are shared.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">My Department will be working with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure that the new arrangements operate as efficiently as possible. As the process proceeds this work can take account of any appropriate local arrangements that might be made to further optimise travel arrangements.  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in Primary Circular 0007/2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">The existing staffing appeals criteria have been extended to cater enable limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures impact on a particularly adverse manner on a school's overall allocation. Schools that are due to lose 3 or more posts as a result of a combination of the budget and reform measures will be able to apply to the Staffing Appeals Board with a view to seeking to have a portion of the loss in posts deferred to the 2013/14 school year. The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the Staffing Appeal Board is 23 March, 2012. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and it's decision is final.</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">The final staffing position for all schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Board will have been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1849">The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedules for the 2012/13 school year were published on my Department's website in February, 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1850">The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board.

            <p eId="para_1852">Due to conflicting numbers of posts being reported as potentially lost to DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 urban primary schools it was necessary to obtain clarity with regard to the net effect of a range of factors on teacher allocations in these schools; for example, increasing and decreasing enrolments, the reforms to the existing teacher allocations process and up to date enrolments, all of which contribute to determining the staffing requirement for these schools for 2012/13 school year.  The Report on the net impact, in terms of posts, of Budget measures on these DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 urban primary schools, that still had additional posts allocated under disadvantage schemes pre-dating DEIS, was published on 21 February 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">Of the 328 DEIS Rural primary schools, 16 of these schools with legacy posts will lose one teaching post each. It should be noted that the overwhelming majority of DEIS Rural Primary Schools have not been affected by this decision.  Of the 195 post primary DEIS schools, 163 of these schools will lose 136 posts. However, all DEIS post-primary schools will be targeted for additional support through an improved staffing schedule of 18.25:1  This is a 0.75 point improvement  compared to the existing standard 19:1 that applies in post-primary schools that do not charge fees (or compared to the  21:1 ratio that will apply in fee-charging schools).</p>

            <p eId="para_1855">My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the 73 small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure. It is worth noting that there are almost 1,200 small schools with 86 pupils or less and no small school will be forced to close as a result of this decision.  Such schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term. The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department's Staffing Circular 0007/2012 including the relevant thresholds to retain a classroom teaching post at Appendix A.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the Staffing Appeal Board is 23 March, 2012. Schools must submit to my Department by 16 March, 2012 a redeployment form for any teacher surplus to requirements who is eligible to be placed on the redeployment panel. I can assure the Deputy that it is intended that the Appeal Board meeting will take place prior to the release of the main redeployment panel in mid to late April, 2012 thus allowing for any impact of the Board's decision on redeployment panels to be effected.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

            <p eId="para_1860">I can confirm to the Deputy that in the case of both the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) that members of the respective Councils were appointed to the position of CEO since 1st January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1861">In respect of the NCSE the current CEO, Ms. Teresa Griffin, was appointed  in March 2011 following her success in a public open competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service in accordance with the code of practice for public sector appointments.  Ms. Griffin was a member of the Council immediately prior to her appointment as CEO due to her then position as Principal Officer in the Special Education Division of my Department. Ms. Griffin was not involved in her role as a member of the Council in the CEO selection or appointment process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">With regard to FETAC the current CEO, Dr. Padraig Walsh, was appointed to this position in June 2011.  The Deputy should note that Dr. Walsh became CEO of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) and CEO Designate of the yet to be established amalgamated qualifications and quality assurance body, to be known as the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland (QQAAI), in October 2010. One of the conditions of his appointment as CEO Designate was that he would also become CEO of FETAC and/or the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) should a vacancy arise in either of those positions in advance of the amalgamation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">When Dr Walsh became CEO of  HETAC in February 2011, following the resignation of the incumbent, and, in accordance with the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, he therefore also became an ex-officio member of the board of FETAC from that time. Therefore Dr Walsh was a member of the Board of FETAC for a period before being appointed CEO of that body. However, this arose because of the forward planning and strategic arrangements put in place in advance of the amalgamation of the existing qualifications and quality assurance bodies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1934">The public works contracts were developed and implemented on a phased basis from 19 February 2007 (Department of Finance Circular 33/06 refers); and applicable to all projects since 13 February 2008 (Department of Finance Circular 04/08).  They must be applied to employer designed and "design and build" public works projects in Ireland that are procured directly by a Government Department, bodies under its aegis, including local authorities or other relevant bodies that provide public services (e.g. schools, voluntary hospitals, etc.).</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">A public works contract contains provision under the Payment and Conditions of Employment clause, which includes measures such as the certificate of compliance to ensure those employed on public works sites are paid in accordance with the Registered Employment Agreement for the Construction Sector.  Supporting guidance notes have also been developed for use with these contracts.  Both the contracts and guidance notes form part of the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF), which was developed to deal with all aspects of the management of capital projects.  The CWMF is a web-based facility maintained by my Department and consists of a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents.  Department of Finance Circular 06/10 made it mandatory for contracting authorities to comply with all aspects of the CWMF.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">From November 2006, centralised training programmes on the new Construction Contracts were provided by the Department of Finance for key public sector practitioners and private sector construction professionals who are engaged by contracting authorities on public sector projects to ensure that the new contract conditions are used appropriately across the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1937">The clause on Pay and Conditions of Employment which includes the provision of the certificate of compliance to which the Deputy refers is referenced in three Department of Finance Circulars; 33/06, 04/08 and 06/10.  Guidance note GN 3.1 — Implementation Process available on my Department's construction procurement website: <i>www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie</i> also provides guidance for contracting authorities on the contract administration stage of a public works project and the manner in which the certificate of compliance is to be used is set out under the section titled “Interim Payments”.  The standard Rates of Pay and Conditions of Employment Certificate (model form MF 1.13) is available on the same website.  Under the clause titled “Payment” in the public works contracts, a contracting authority may not make a payment to a contractor unless the contractor’s payment application is accompanied by a copy of MF 1.13 signed by the contractor.</p>

            <p eId="para_1941">Public procurement is the acquisition, whether under formal contract or not, of works, supplies and services by public bodies. Public procurement policy is aimed at ensuring that all public sector purchasing is carried out in a manner that is legal, transparent, and secures optimal value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">The changed economic environment has meant that it is necessary to do "better for less", providing real value-for-money for the Irish taxpayer by maximising efficiency and eliminating waste. In order to achieve these objectives my Department has developed a Public Service Reform implementation plan.  This Plan outlines the priority actions and timelines for reform in a broad range of areas including procurement, as well as setting out how implementation should be driven and monitored.</p>
            <p eId="para_1943">The main components of procurement reform are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1944">A revised Policy Framework is being developed to build on the reforms that have already taken place in procurement. The reform plan will focus on achieving value for money through further harnessing the State's purchasing power in relation to commonly used supplies and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1945">The reform plan includes specific measures to ensure that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1946">these aggregated procurement arrangements are utilised across the public service;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1947">public bodies have appropriately trained staff to implement the reforms and to ensure the State is getting value for money; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1948">that greater emphasis will be placed on analysing what the State purchases in order to assess other possible savings can be made through more efficient procurement methods.</p>
            <p eId="para_1949">The National Procurement Service will play an important role in public procurement reform through ambitiously expanding the use of aggregated procurement for commonly used products and services. They will achieve this by:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1950">working with bodies throughout the public service to increase the procurement capacity of staff throughout the public service;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1951">informing public bodies of the savings that can be made through the use of existing centralised frameworks where they are available; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1952">drawing up a plan that will see more aggregated procurement of commonly used products and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">These reforms will achieve better value for taxpayer's money through reform of public procurement arrangements leading to increased use of common/centralised procurement frameworks, increased professionalism in procurement and innovative use of technology.</p>

            <p eId="para_1957">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies. In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Mr Brian Hayes has been working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator's private members' Construction Contracts Bill — which had passed all stages in the Seanad and had moved onto the Dáil order paper — into a robust piece of legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">In order to address a number of issues that were raised during the consultation on the Bill a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was carried out. It found that legislation is desirable to improve payment practices and to allow swift resolution of payment disputes by way of adjudication, allowing projects to be completed without wasting time and money in litigation. The RIA was completed and published last September. The Report is available on my Department's website: <i>www.per.gov.ie/reports</i>.  Following the RIA, Minister Hayes brought proposals to progress this legislation to Government last week. These proposals have been agreed by Government and it is expected that the legislation will proceed in the Dáil shortly. It is essential that the solution to this issue needs to be balanced so as to avoid imposing regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.</p>

            <p eId="para_2033">I have no plans to put in place a prohibition of former members of boards of statutory companies applying for positions with the organisation on whose boards they served.  The Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies provides for the preparation of Codes of Business Conduct for Directors and Employees.  It suggests that the Code should recommend that the acceptance of further employment where the potential for conflict of interest arises should be avoided during a reasonable period of time after the exercise of a function in the State body has ceased. Clearly, this is intended to cover a move to another organisation rather than employment within the same organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">Of course, great care should always be taken to ensure no conflict of interest arises in relation to any appointment to a State Body. On a slightly separate note, the Programme for Government contains a commitment relating to potential conflict of interest to "<i>amend the rules to ensure that no senior public servant (including political appointees) or Minister can work in the private sector in any area involving a potential conflict of interest with their former area of public employment, until at least two years have elapsed after they have left public office”.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_2035">This commitment is being progressed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of its work to introduce a legislative framework for the regulation of lobbyists.  A consultation process began before Christmas 2011 in respect of the regulation of lobbying and the issue of conflict of interest was included in this process. The closing date for submissions was 29 February 2012 and more than 50 were received which are currently being reviewed by the Department and will be published on the Department's website next week.</p>

This will be a long term project and there will be no public access to the castle for the duration of the project.  The issue of internal works to provide public access will be reviewed following completion of external conservation works.

            <p eId="para_2041">I announced on 10th November 2011, in the context of unveiling the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework 2012-2016, that the Government has decided to review a number of options regarding the future of the National Lottery.  My Department is currently examining the various options with respect to the next Lottery licence and I expect to be in a position to revert to Government shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">The Government's intention is to seek a large upfront payment to the State as part of the arrangements for the new licence, with some of the payment to be used to help fund the building of the proposed new National Children's Hospital.  Any new arrangements for the National Lottery will involve the continued provision of significant annual revenues from the Lottery for good causes.  However, in advance of a final decision by Government, it would be premature for me to speculate at this stage on possible terms for the next licence.</p>

        <b> Deputy Sean Fleming</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</b>
         the proposals for the next phase of downsizing of the public service; the discussions that have taken place on this issue; the targets in terms of downsizing to be achieved for the remainder of 2012 and the targets for 2013 in terms of the gross numbers of staff leaving, additional employment and the net reduction in public sector numbers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2044">As the Deputy is aware from my reply to PQ number 8485/12 last month policy decisions have not yet been taken with regard to numbers targets for 2013 and 2014. However, as published in thePublic Service Reform Plan, the Government's Public Service numbers target is 282,500 by end-2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_2045">The Public Service Reform Plan published on the 17 November last sets out the Government's target of bringing public service staffing numbers to 282,500 by end-2015. In moving towards this objective, the end-2011 provisional outturn was 296,900, and the Employment Control Framework (ECF) for 2012 set a ceiling of 294,400 on numbers by the end of this year.  This will allow scope for some targeted recruitment (of the order of 3,000) so as to address needs in key areas of front-line services (particularly in the Health and Education Sectors) and other strategic requirements.  ECF ceilings for 2013 and 2014 have not yet been decided upon.</p>
            <p eId="para_2046">Following the expiry in recent days of the grace period for retirements, my Department will now be reviewing the aggregate staffing numbers situation and we will be then deciding on the appropriate path and measures for the period 2012 to 2015 so as to ensure achievement of the Government's end 2015 target of 282,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">As the Deputy will also be aware the Government has established Strategic Workforce Planning groups in the Education, Health Civil Service, Local Authorities, Defence and Justice Sectors. These Workforce Planning Groups will ensure that sectoral employers are developing plans to deal with the operational and strategic consequences arising from staffing reductions. These sectoral groups are liaising with the central Strategic Workforce Planning Forum under my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">I am confident that given the number of departures in 2011, together with estimated retirement numbers for 2012 we are on track to meet our target for 2012 of 294,400. This will allow scope to recruit staff where necessary to maintain essential services, mainly in the Health and Education sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_2050">The information sought by the Deputy is not recorded centrally for public contracts.  Contracting authorities are currently only obliged to publish contract award notices on eTenders and the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) for those contracts whose values exceed the EU thresholds.  The current EU threshold for public works contracts is above €5 million; and for supplies and services above €130,000/€200,000 (Government Departments and Offices/Local and Regional Authorities and public bodies outside the Utilities sector).  The majority of public contracts awarded fall below these thresholds and data on the companies to which they have been awarded are generally held only by the contracting authority concerned.  In some cases contract award notices are published for contracts below these levels, although this is not obligatory.  The National Procurement Service who administers the eTenders website <i>www.etenders.ie</i> has advised my Department that there is no evidence that any contracts have been awarded to the companies which are the subject of the Deputy’s question.</p>

            <p eId="para_2054">The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) case management system facilitates the capturing of details in respect of employers inspected in various sectors, including construction and electrical.  It does not capture details in respect of individual employers which may, as part of their overall business, have been engaged in public contract work.  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) carries out inspections, on a risk management basis, on receipt of a complaint or as part of its ongoing proactive inspection programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2055">Contractors working in the construction sector come within the terms of the Registered Employment Agreement for the Construction Industry, where they are building or civil engineering undertakings, the principal business of which is one or a combination of any of the activities set out in the agreement.  Contractors may also come within the terms of the Registered Employment Agreement for the Electrical Contracting Industry where the main activity of the business is the performance of electrical work on a contract or sub-contract basis for a third party.  The table provides details of inspections carried out under both Agreements for the period 2008 to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_2136">As I have pointed out on many occasions, the Government does not create jobs — entrepreneurs and successful businesses do.  However, the Government has a key role to play in providing the environment where businesses can start-up, expand and create jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">The Action Plan for Jobs, which was launched on 13th February, aims to transform the operating environment for business in order to support enterprise growth and job creation.  The Government will achieve this objective by systematically removing obstacles to competitiveness, putting downward pressure on business costs, promoting innovation and trade, supporting new and existing businesses to develop and expand, and by deepening the impact of foreign direct investment in Ireland.  The Government has also identified, in the Action Plan, a number of key sectors where Ireland can gain competitive advantage in global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">The Action Plan for Jobs has set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020.  Of the net 100,000 jobs to be created over the next five years, 20,000 are projected to be generated directly in manufacturing, while 30,000 will be created in international traded services.  An additional 50,000 jobs will be generated indirectly through spin-offs and support activities.  While the Government will play the primary role in implementing the Action Plan for Jobs, we will work in partnership with the enterprise sector and the wider community to deliver the Plan's objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_2141">I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 99 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">The Quarterly National Household Survey for the fourth quarter of 2011 shows that 60% of those who are unemployed have been out of work for 12 months or more.  Unemployment amongst people under 25 years of age is running at approximately 30%.  The Government has recognised that these levels of unemployment could become a structural problem for our society unless the situation is addressed quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">There are two major elements to the Government's response to unemployment — the Action Plan for Jobs and "Pathways to Work".  The Action Plan includes a total of 270 specific measures to be delivered across the whole of Government.  Pathways to Work will be delivered by the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills, and the relevant bodies under their aegis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">The goal of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support the creation of new jobs in the economy, while the aim of Pathways to Work is to help to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible are filled by people from the Live Register.  Both documents are fundamentally linked and recognise the need to reform our policies and our structures to secure long-term and lasting results for our enterprise base and for job-seekers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2145">The Action Plan for Jobs has set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020.  Pathways to Work has five major strands, covering:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2146">more regular and ongoing engagement with people who are unemployed,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2147">greater targeting of activation places and opportunities,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2148">incentivising the take-up of opportunities,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2149">incentivising employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2150">reforming institutions to deliver better services to people who are unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">The public employment services will be reformed through the creation of the new National Employment and Entitlements Service which will provide better targeted services to both job seekers and employers. The new service will include the provision of recruitment and job-matching services for employers to facilitate the hiring of workers from the Live Register.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">Under Pathways to Work, the Department of Social Protection is committed to supporting over 85,000 beneficiaries in job placement, work experience and back to education schemes in 2012.  The Department of Education and Skills will also provide over 457,000 training and education places, including provision for Early School Leavers.  The provision of services to address long term youth unemployment will be continued as part of the Government's activation measures for the unemployed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2155">I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 93 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2156">International benchmarking statistics reveal that Ireland imposes a relatively low burden of regulation on business. The Forfás Competitiveness Scoreboard 2011 states that Ireland's regulatory environment is one of the least restrictive in the OECD in relation to product market regulation, the time taken to comply with tax payments is one of the lowest in the OECD across all categories and Ireland's employment framework is less rigid than the OECD average.</p>
            <p eId="para_2157">The work to reduce administrative burdens and costs on business in Ireland is being progressed on two fronts. The High Level Group on Business Regulation works to fast-track simplifications to specific red tape issues identified by business; and an inter-departmental group of officials from all Departments, having regulation affecting business, drives the measurement and reduction of administrative burdens in a systematic manner, based on the internationally recognised Standard Cost Model.  To date, the High Level Group has progressed a range of administrative burden issues brought to its attention by business and continues to drive progress on further issues. The Group continues to work with business interests to identify new opportunities for simplification.</p>
            <p eId="para_2158">Good progress has been made by my Department and its Agencies in reducing administrative burdens with a reduction of over 23% having already been achieved.  This amounts to an annual saving of over €198 million.  Details of all the initiatives making up this total are available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2159">My Department also co-ordinates the cross-government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens, towards the 25% target to be reached by the end of this year. A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011. I expect results from the first cluster of Departments by the end of the first quarter this year and from the second cluster by the end of quarter two.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">When the measurements are complete, we will know the administrative burden arising for business as a result of regulation under the responsibility of each of these Departments, as well as how much these burdens have been reduced since the base year, which is 2008.  Each Department must then draft a Simplification Plan setting out how they will achieve the remaining reductions to reach the 25% target. The first cluster of Departments should report to Government with Simplification Plans by the end of quarter two, and the second cluster by end quarter three.</p>

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2162">A key priority of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate supply of credit is available to fund small and medium sized businesses.  The Government's restructuring of the main pillar banks last year was designed to ensure a better flow of credit to viable businesses. In addition the Government has four distinct measures it is delivering to supplement the more traditional sources of credit for business.  These are: a Microfinance fund for business start-ups, a Partial Loan Guarantee for SMEs struggling to access credit, a Development Capital fund for businesses primed for rapid growth and the Innovation Fund for Ireland which provides investment funds for innovative, high tech start-ups.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">Work is well advanced in my Department to realise our commitments in terms of the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme and Microfinance Loan Scheme.  An Operator for the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme has been selected through a public tendering process and will be contracted by my Department to act as the agent for the practical oversight, management and operation of the Scheme.  Primary legislation to underpin the Scheme is being urgently progressed with the Attorney General's Office, and a Credit Guarantee Bill will be published during this Spring session.  The Guarantee Scheme will go live as soon as possible following enactment of the legislation in Quarter 2 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">I am currently finalising the delivery structures for the Microfinance Loan Fund to provide loans to the microenterprise sector. This Fund is designed to stimulate lending to sustainable microenterprises and is targeted at start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises across all industry sectors, employing not more than 10 people.  It will provide loans of up to €25,000 for commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial banks.  The Government recently approved the allocation of €10 million as seed capital for the Fund. It is anticipated that the Fund will supplement this seed capital by leveraging further funding from private sources, including the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">Following establishment of the Microfinance lending facility, application will be made for the EIF guarantee facility. A rigorous due diligence process is required to secure EIF accreditation. Following EIF approval of the guarantee facility, and subject to completion of all administrative and corporate governance requirements, it is anticipated that the Loan Fund will become operational  in  Quarter 3 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2166">The Development Capital Scheme as outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs has been developed to complement the existing range of financial supports offered by Enterprise Ireland (EI).  It is proposed that the Scheme will be launched and marketed by end Q1 2012.  The exchequer funding requirement for this scheme is €50m over 10 years.  The scheme will be demand led and will target the cohort of companies that are growth focused.  It will be open to all firms in that cohort regardless of their location in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2167">Innovation Fund Ireland is a key pillar of building our smart economy and investments through the Fund facilitate job creation in innovative export focused sectors as well as proving a return to the exchequer over time. The Fund has up to €250 million available to make commitments. Over the lifetime of the funds, it is envisaged that the State will make a return on its investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2168">The first round of commitments out of the €125m of Enterprise Ireland managed funds are expected to be to be formalised in the near term with commitments of approximately €60m.  I issued a statement on October 5th indicating my intention to issue a second call for expressions of interest for the balance of the fund of €65m, when the first of the new Irish offices associated with these new investments is established. The operation of the Innovation Fund will continue to be managed by EI in ongoing co-operation with the NPRF.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes a commitment for the Pillar banks to produce quarterly reports for the Department of Finance which incorporate figures for sanctions and drawdowns by  SMEs. The data contained in these reports will be reviewed and analysed by the Department of Finance and the CRO, with a sharper focus on the "new money" element, to ensure that the pillar banks are compliant with the terms of the Government recapitalisation as it relates to the provision of credit for SMEs.  These targeted measures supplement the initiatives already taken by the Minister for Finance to restructure, re-capitalise, reorganise and deleverage the banking system to ensure a properly functioning banking system and secure an adequate flow of credit into the economy to support economic recovery.</p>

The main purpose of the Bill is to implement the commitment in the Programme for Government to reform the Joint Labour Committee system.

            <p eId="para_2172">In addition, the Bill provides for the more comprehensive measures required to strengthen the legal framework for the Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreement sectoral wage setting mechanisms, under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004, in the light of deficiencies in the original legislation identified in the July 2011 High Court judgment in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2173">The fact that the process of making EROs has been found by the High Court to be unconstitutional, together with the identified lack of adequate Oireachtas scrutiny of this process, only underscores some of the main features of the recommendations for reform that were put forward by the Independent Review Report on these statutory wage setting mechanisms — the Duffy/ Walsh report. The commissioning of the independent review of the ERO and REA systems was one of the undertakings given by the last Government in the context of the EU and IMF-supported financial assistance programme for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2174">When enacted, this Bill, will implement the programme of reforms to the JLC/REA systems agreed by Government in July 2011. It will radically overhaul the system so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  It will also reinstate a robust system of protection for workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2175">The principal measures in the legislation include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2176">JLCs will have the power to set a basic adult rate and two additional higher rates, based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned as well as the standards and skills recognised for the sector concerned.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2177">JLCs will no longer set Sunday premium rates. In order to recognise the special status of Sunday working a statutory Code of Practice will be prepared by the LRC following submissions from employers and trade unions. This Code will provide guidance to both parties in the sectors covering EROs on the compensatory arrangements, including such additional amounts as are reasonable, for Sunday working and on the procedure to apply in the event of disputes concerning the varying entitlements to Sunday working.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2178">Companies will be able to derogate from EROs and REAs in cases of financial difficulty. For this to occur, the Labour Court must satisfy itself that specified criteria have been met. Such derogation will be granted, for a limited period, in cases of proven economic difficulty, following consultation with the employees.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2179">In setting rates, JLCs will have to take into account a series of economic and industrial relations factors.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2180">The burden of compliance and record-keeping requirements for employers in these sectors will be reduced.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2181">Providing for Ministerial involvement in the supervision of JLCs and in the making of orders to vary or revoke EROs.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2182">Providing for use of civil remedies rather than an exclusive reliance on criminal sanctions.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2183">The constitutionality of EROs and REAs will be restored through inclusion of robust principles and policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">I am also proceeding with a series of complementary reforms to the JLC system which can be implemented without the need for legislative change, including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2185">Reducing the number of JLCs from 13 to 6;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2186">Standardising benefits such as overtime through a nationally agreed protocol or Code of Practice, through the normal process of consultation with the employers and trade union interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_2187">From the beginning of this process I have been determined to strike a balance between protecting vulnerable workers and providing reforms that would make the systems more competitive and more flexible so as to allow the creation of jobs in these sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2188">From an employer's perspective, the overall effect of these reforms will be to substantially reduce the burden of record-keeping and compliance. This Bill will make the long-established minimum wage setting mechanisms fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and will eliminate rigidities that are considered to have had a negative impact on competitiveness and jobs in the affected sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2190">It has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of this country and through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association.   There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process.  The freedom of association and the right to organise and bargain collectively are also guaranteed in a number of international instruments which the State has ratified.</p>
            <p eId="para_2191">The Programme for Government includes a commitment to ensure that Irish law on employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining is consistent with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights. Giving effect to this commitment will require consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework as put in place under the Industrial Relations Acts of 2001 and 2004 and the consequences of the litigation that has arisen in the course of the operation of these Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2192">I believe that the established dispute settling institutions should continue to play an important role in disputes over trade union recognition.  I am certain that satisfactory arrangements can be put in place that are suited to our constitutional, social and economic traditions, as well as our international obligations.  I am also convinced that they can be framed so as to ensure continued success in attracting investment into our economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2194">Ireland, along with nineteen other countries among the EU's 27 Member States, has national legislation setting a minimum wage.  There are large differences in the level of the national minimum wage across countries with the highest minimum wage in euro terms (both hourly and monthly) being more than 10 times higher than the lowest.   In January 2012, the gross minimum monthly wage in the EU ranged from €138 (Bulgaria) to €1,801 (Luxembourg).</p>
            <p eId="para_2195">The current Programme for Government contained a commitment to reverse the €1 per hour reduction in the National Minimum Wage introduced by the previous Government on 1 February 2011.  Agreement was reached with the Troika on the reversal.  The increase was provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011 and effected by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (Section 11) (No. 2) Order 2011 on July 1st 2011.  The restoration of the National Minimum Wage to €8.65 per hour represents a significant commitment by the Government to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2197">Last November, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform launched the Public Service Reform Plan, which was based on increasing efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility in the Public Service.  There is an onus on the Public Service to ensure that it provides real value for money in the services it provides.  One of the key themes of the Reform Plan is to maximise new and innovative service delivery channels.  As well as increasing the use of eGovernment and improving service processes generally, this includes the consideration of options for external service delivery and a number of actions in this regard are set out in the Reform Plan.  It is clear that developments in this area may present opportunities for private sector organisations and for job creation within those companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2198">More generally, in developing and improving the capacity and capability of the Public Service, the input of the private sector will be of value at a time when we are radically changing delivery models.  In this context, private sector involvement can help to offer new ideas and innovative approaches to public service delivery, while maintaining a client-centred focus.</p>

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2201">I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2202">Employment policies that promote labour market flexibility together with tax and benefit systems that reward work and provide a pathway to employment, education and training opportunities for those who have lost their jobs are a necessary prerequisite for progress. The measures in the Government's <i>Action Plan on Jobs</i> together with those to support the unemployed to return to the workforce in <i>Pathways to Work</i>   are consistent with the European Union’s policy of flexicurity as an integrated strategy for enhancing, at the same time, flexibility and security in the labour market. Measures to combine flexibility and security represent a crucial element of the annual Employment Guidelines and the European Employment Strategy as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_2203">As a result of successfully shifting taxes away from labour, towards areas less detrimental to employment growth, Ireland's tax wedge on income earners is the lowest in the EU 27. This is consistent with the aim of developing a tax system that supports competitiveness, employment and enterprise. According to the latest OECD Taxing Wages report, based on wage and tax levels for 2010, Ireland had the eight lowest tax wedge (29.3%) of the 34 members in the OECD for a single worker on average earnings (€39,555).</p>
            <p eId="para_2204">Ireland has been able to bring down its unit labour costs substantially from 2008.  Unit labour costs measure the average cost of labour per unit of output. Declining unit labour costs mean that productivity has increased faster than earnings — thus indicating an improvement in competitiveness. While the rate of growth in Irish unit labour costs significantly exceeded the OECD and euro area averages between 2005 and 2008, unit labour costs in Ireland have been falling consistently since then. Meanwhile, average OECD and euro area unit labour costs have continued to grow, albeit slowly.  Therefore, at an economy wide level, Irish labour wage rates — when adjusted for productivity — are becoming more cost competitive. Unit labour costs are improving faster in the internationally trading manufacturing sector than in more closed sectors of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2205">In its recent European Economic Forecast for Autumn 2011, the European Commission anticipates that Irish unit labour costs will fall by a cumulative 14.4% over the period 2009 to 2013. This decline reflects a recovery in productivity coupled with a decline in compensation per head.   Unit labour costs in the euro area as a whole, by comparison, are forecast to increase by 6.6% over the same period.  Therefore, Ireland's relative position will have improved by around 21% <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Euro area since 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2206">Labour costs remain a significant component of overall competitiveness; international benchmark data show that labour costs account for as much as three quarters of location-sensitive costs in manufacturing and that Ireland still has the tenth highest total labour costs in the OECD.</p>
            <p eId="para_2207">Ireland's labour market flexibilities are acknowledged as a valuable accompaniment of our open economy, high level of human capital and business friendly environment.  The quality of Ireland's labour market ranks highly in international comparisons. In the 2011 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook, Ireland is ranked first in terms of availability of skilled labour and seventh for the flexibility and adaptability of people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2208">The Action Plan for Jobs identifies the scope for reducing the cost of business and easing new recruitment through a series of initiatives, including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2209">Simplifying and extending the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme, which exempts employers from liability to pay their share of PRSI for certain employees. The scheme will be extended to cover the first 18 months of employment</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2210">The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals in organizations in the private, public and community and voluntary sectors.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2211">The Revenue Job Assist Scheme provides incentives to employers through a double deduction and for employees through additional tax allowances for those unemployed for at least 12 months.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2212">The new incentive scheme to encourage foreign mobile talent (SARP) will allow multinationals and indigenous companies to attract people to create more jobs and facilitate business expansion in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2213">High unemployment remains a difficult challenge and requires resolute action through appropriate reforms in the labour market, including measures to reform statutory wage setting mechanisms to ensure that they are responsive to changing economic conditions and the transformation of labour market activation policies along the line outlined in the Government's policy statement <i>Pathways to Work.</i>

            <p eId="para_2215">The Government has an ambition to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business by 2016.  To achieve this objective, we must improve our international competitiveness and the competitiveness of companies based here.  Competitiveness is determined by a variety of factors, including business costs, increased productivity, the availability of skilled labour, good infrastructure, the quality and intensity of innovation and research, and regulation that supports enterprise growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_2216">Since 2008, Ireland has regained some of the competitiveness it had lost.  However, more must be done to ensure that the improvements we have achieved are structural in nature and sustained in the longer-term.

            <p eId="para_2223">One of the key actions to be undertaken by my Department and Forfás this year is to identify a set of competitiveness indicators where Ireland's international performance can be improved through domestic policy action.  In the areas identified, we will quantify the level of improvement necessary to place Ireland amongst the five most competitive economies in the OECD, and we will set out the policy actions required to achieve this goal.</p>

            <p eId="para_2225">As Minister with responsibility for Enterprise Policy, I have recently announced in the Action Plan for Jobs that a new "one-stop-shop" micro enterprise support structure will be established through the dissolution of the existing CEB structures and the creation of a new Micro Enterprise and Small Business Unit in Enterprise Ireland.  EI will work with the Local Authorities to establish a new network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs).  The LEOs will combine the enterprise support service previously provided by the CEBs and the business support work of the Business Support Units in the Local Authorities, offering an enhanced service because of their seamless access to both EI expertise and the broader business services of the Local Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2226">The aim of the proposal is not simply about abolition or dissolution it is about developing and to enhancing the State services to small business at local level by:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2227">Delivering a one-stop-shop for small business;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2228">Offering a seamless service for small companies to take up the wider range of Enterprise Ireland programmes for companies with rapid growth potential;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2230">Enlisting the Local Authorities into a more active role in small business support and local economic development;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2231">Establishing a more integrated network between local and national enterprise support which will ensure high standards, uniformly delivered to benchmarked standards of best practice;, and that small business development is supported by appropriate benchmarking within EI.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2232">Encouraging innovative approaches to support small business.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">In conjunction with the dissolution of the CEB legal structure, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities will be tasked with the practicalities of setting-up and rolling-out a LEO structure. There is clearly a lot of detailed developmental work to be done over the coming months to effect these changes, and to put appropriate new structures in place. I will shortly establish a steering group chaired by my Department, which will move this process forward and address all of the relevant issues.  Clearly it is essential that all relevant parties continue to work together to bring about this positive change as a priority and that the continuity of a high level of service to the micro-enterprise sector is preserved in the transition phase.</p>

            <p eId="para_2254">The issue of reforming the current arrangements associated with sick pay is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area; the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund; the need to control welfare spending in line with the commitments this country has entered into with the EU/IMF/ECB troika; and in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism in the public and private sectors.  Before any decisions can be taken on the possible introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay, a range of issues need to be examined in detail — including the extent of coverage; the duration of payment;  the rate of payment; compensation  mechanisms for employers where appropriate; and how to ensure that a scheme of statutory sick pay would be enforced and policed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2256">The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors. The income level of parents does not impact on eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme; rather the Scheme is targeted at individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2257">The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register. It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The structure for achieving this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2258">Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</p>
            <p eId="para_2259">For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.  My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.</p>

         her decision, announced in budget 2012, to reduce the employer’s rebate on redundancies from 60% to15%, if she will consider reviewing her position and consider introducing a derogation from the reduced rate for the small and medium enterprise sector.

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2261">The purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  Compensation is based on the worker's length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of €600.00 per week.  All payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  There are two types of redundancy payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership or liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2262">It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to their employees is then entitled to a rebate from the State.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Significant and increasing amounts have been paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF in recent years.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers' contribution is also significant.  One of the factors which influenced the Government's decision to revise the rebate rate was the increasing costs of rebates in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2263">I am very concerned about the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund.  Where the date of dismissal for the purposes of redundancy occurred before 1 January 2012 the Social Insurance Fund refunded employers 60 per cent of the cost of making people redundant.  €152.2 million was paid out in rebates to employers in 2006; €167.4 million was paid in 2007; €161.8 million was paid in 2008; €247.9 million in 2009; €373.2 million in 2010 and €188.2 million in 2011.  The amounts paid out in lump sums to employees have also increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_2264">I do not see why this country should continue to borrow money to plug the hole in the Social Insurance Fund in order to fund the cost of making people redundant — often from very profitable companies.  As part of the deliberations on Budget 2012, the approach taken in other countries was examined and it was decided that the 60% level of rebate is not sustainable in the current economic climate.   While this may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  The new arrangements bring Ireland more closely into line with practice in other countries.</p>

The DSP acknowledges the valuable contribution made by this and other community employment projects.  However, due to the current economic circumstances, the Department has had to find significant savings in the budget for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2269">A financial review of all community employment projects is currently being carried out.  It is anticipated that Community Employment projects will see a reduction in the level of grant aid allocated in respect of materials and training in 2012 as funding will be allocated according to the needs of the participants and the project circumstances. The purpose of the review is to establish the level of need and this review should be completed by the end of March 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">The project has been advised that the DSP will cover the cost of the project in full during the review period and local management have been given discretion to vary the level of funding in respect of materials up to €1,000 per place where a strong case is made that this is justified. It is also expected that the project will make every effort to reduce costs and in this regard the project undertook to discuss the rents cost with their landlord with a view to agreeing a more favourable rate.  The project are also looking elsewhere for alternative premises.  When the review is completed and DSP has a clearer indication of the amount that will be allocated to projects for materials, DSP will meet with the project again to further examine their situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2282">State pension (transition) (SPT) and State pension (contributory) (SPC) are social insurance payments made when a person reaches 65 and 66 years of age respectively.  They are both based on the person's social insurance record (PRSI) from employment or self employment.  To qualify a person needs to (a) enter insurable employment by age 55 for State pension (transition) and age 56 for State pension (contributory), (b) have paid 260 full rate social insurance contributions and (c) have a yearly average contributions of at least 10 for State pension (contributory), and at least 24 for State pension (transition).   The yearly average determines the weekly rate of payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2283">The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  So the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  People are living longer and healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.</p>
            <p eId="para_2284">Recognising that the SPC is a very valuable benefit, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over a working life thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system.  By aligning the rate of pension paid with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. It is important to link payment of pension to contributions paid over a working life as attachment to the workforce remains a key issue for the sustainability of pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2285">In this regard, a number of pension reform measures which will affect how pensions are calculated are due to be implemented this year. For the calculation of SPT and SPC there will be an increase in the minimum paid contribution required from 260 to 520 contributions in April 2012.   This change has been provided for in legislation since 1997. A further reform measure was announced in Budget 2012 providing for a change to the rates bands for SPC which is being introduced from September 2012.   From then, the rate band of between 20 and 47 yearly average contributions will be replaced with  new rate bands of between:-</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2286">(i) 40 and 47 yearly average contributions</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2287">(ii)  30 and 39 yearly average contribution and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2288">(iii)   20 and 29 yearly average contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2289">Therefore, the rate of SPC paid to new applicants will be appropriate to the average number of contributions paid over a working life.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  The maximum rate is unchanged as is the rate for those with yearly average contributions of between 40 and 47.  While existing pension recipients are unaffected, the changes proposed will apply to new claimants from September 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2290">Claimants who qualify for a reduced rate of SPC and who have income needs may qualify, depending on their means, for a higher rate of State pension (non-contributory).  Details of the new rates bands for SPC are set out below.  Customers will be notified of their future entitlements when their claim is processed.  In general, applications for SPT should be submitted at least 4-5 months before a person reaches his/her 65th  birthday while applications for SPC should be submitted at least 4-5 months before reaching age 66.    In advance of this a person can request a copy of their contribution records from the Central Records Section of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2291">I understand that the person concerned will qualify for a full rate SPC reaching age 66 on 11 November 2012.   She would not appear to qualify for SPT as she is self-employed and class PRSI contributions are not reckonable for SPT.</p>

In this context, the information leaflet ‘SW124 — Working with your Spouse' produced by this Department, deals with contributions and entitlements in this situation, including seeking retrospective business partnership status; contributions; shortfalls in PRSI and seeking professional advice.  If an application for a business partnership is established, the pension entitlement of each of the spouses will be calculated having regard to the changes outlined above.</p>

            <p eId="para_2349">Tús, the community work placement initiative introduced during 2011, will provide short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year when fully operational.

As of Monday, 5th March 2012, 50 participants and 3 supervisors have been engaged by Northside Partnership out of their assigned quota of 120 participants and 6 supervisors. While half of the local development companies engaged to deliver Tús have achieved full implementation, Northside Partnership based on progress to date, is unlikely to achieve full implementation until mid 2012.</p>

These include the willingness of selected participants to co-operate, need for significant activation work with some participants due to the length of time away from a working environment, challenges with language competencies, imbalance in the gender of persons referred, difficulties of matching skills to available work placements and slowness by community and voluntary organisations to offer work placements in the company's operational area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">Tús aims to improve the employability and work readiness of participants by providing them with the opportunities to put work skills into practice and learn new ones enabling progression to work, further education or skill development opportunities. In addition, Tús will boost the participants' motivation and confidence, while simultaneously providing prospective employers with evidence that a participant has the necessary skills and abilities to do the job.  A review of Tús will be initiated over the coming months to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the initiative. This review will allow for changes to be made to the initiative where these are considered necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_2353">I am very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer facing services at a local level for clients of the Department in Kerry and every other part of the country and in this regard the location of the Department's offices are kept under constant review to ensure Departmental services are easily accessible to all clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">In order to offer a more streamlined, efficient and integrated service to clients, the Department is undergoing a process of intensive planning and organisational change in establishing the new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES).  The establishment of the NEES brings together the Community Welfare Service (CWS), the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of FÁS, the Rural Social Scheme and Community Services Programme from the former Department of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht and the Redundancy and Insolvency Schemes from the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  It is the intention that the NEES will integrate all employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit.  This new service will provide a coherent integrated and more personalised service to clients and will help minimise the duplication that characterised services which were provided separately in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_2355">The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed, having regard to workloads, management priorities and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department. As the Deputy will be aware there is currently a moratorium on recruitment across the civil and public service.  I can assure the Deputy that the Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies, including those arising from retirements, by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the Employment Control Framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>

There are Cultural Contact Points in each of the participating countries of the EU Culture Programme.  Their role is to provide information, advice and technical assistance to anyone in the country interested in applying to the EU for funding under the Culture Programme 2007-2013.  The CCP Ireland is based at the Arts Council.  The EU makes a contribution of up to €35,000 towards the operation of the CCP.  In addition to this, the Arts Council contributes €47,000 which including administrative costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2370">Since 2007, Irish cultural organisations have been involved in projects that have received grants in excess of €14.8m from the Culture Programme.  The Irish take of these grants is estimated to be in the region of €3m.  Recent statistics show that Ireland's participation is improving and organisations are now more likely to look to Europe for funding.  Overall, the picture is optimistic for Irish application levels to gain a critical mass in the near future judging by the increased level of interest in the past three years.  I have no plans to reassign this responsibility from the Arts Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_2381">Following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.  The Regulation required that all Member States prepare a national Eel Management Plan (EMP).  Ireland's plan was approved by the European Commission in July, 2009.  The Conservation of Eel Fishing By-Law No. C.S 303, 2009, and Conservation of Eel Fishing (Prohibition On Issue Of Licences) By-Law No. 858, 2009 give effect to the National Eel Management Plan and provide for closure of the fishery until June 2012, when the status of stocks will be fully reviewed and reported on to the European Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2382">This review will consider whether the eel fishery could be reopened in any River Basin District in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of stocks.  The EMP includes a comprehensive programme of monitoring and evaluation of management actions and their implementation.  It also includes a programme of scientific eel stock assessment to establish a stock baseline, estimate current silver eel escapement and monitoring the impact of the management actions on the local stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2383">The imperative is to ensure that the vulnerable stocks of eels are protected — currently it would be premature to speculate on the future of the eel fishery and whether it will be open to commercial exploitation.  The status of the European Eel in Ireland was recently defined as critically endangered (Ireland Amphibians, Reptiles &amp; Freshwater Fish Red Data List, published in 2011).  Scientific analysis estimated that 2007 Eel escapement (adults going to sea) was at 23% of pristine stock and declining. Due to the very long cycle and slow growth in Irish waters it is probable that any recovery of the Irish eel stocks will be over a very long time frame.</p>

In the case of one such intervention, namely the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), services are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, 3, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in each of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.  The area of Hobartstown, Moone, County Kildare in Belan ED (Ref: 87012), falls outside of the NBS Coverage Area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2387">The EU State Aid and competition rules govern how States can intervene in areas where existing service providers operate.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  The mapping exercise undertaken by my Department at the time of designing the NBS in 2008, found that broadband services were available in Belan ED and consequently the ED was excluded from the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2388">However, the general area of Moone, County Kildare encompasses two additional EDs, namely Carrigeen ED (Ref: 87021) and Moone ED (Ref: 87068), both of which are in the NBS Coverage Area and residents in these areas can obtain broadband through the Scheme.  Should residents in the general area of Moone, County Kildare, wish to check if their premisesis in the NBS Coverage Area, they can do so by contacting 3 by telephone at 1800 944791or by using the Coverage Check facility on 3's website at the following link: <i>http://www.three.ie/contractstore/shop/flow/BroadbandCoverageCheck.aspx</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2389">The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  This Scheme, which is being rolled out this year, is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas who wish to avail of such services.  There were 198 applications made to the RBS in respect of premises in County Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_2390">The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission's "Digital Agenda for Europe" target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I convened last summer, has an important role to play in this regard.  It comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The Taskforce will conclude its deliberations shortly.  I intend to consider the findings and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce as quickly as possible and to make a submission to Government in this regard.  It is my objective to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_2393">I refer the Deputy to previous replies to Parliamentary Questions on this matter.  The decision on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors is statutorily a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  I have no function in the matter.  The CER, as the independent energy regulator has a remit to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness.  In particular it must ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2394">There have been requests, from Shannon LNG and others, to me as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to issue a policy direction to the CER in accordance with powers of direction as provided under Section 10A of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  The content of such a policy direction has not been specified by the advocates but it appears the intention is that a Ministerial direction could be used to intervene to influence CER's decision making about the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors, in particular with reference to the imposition of a tariff on this project, on the basis that Shannon LNG alleges that the decision is, in their view, set to damage its future business.</p>
            <p eId="para_2395">The 2002 Act confers specific legislative powers on the CER to regulate and determine the tariffs applicable to the gas transmission system. By law, the CER makes decisions pursuant to these powers independently of the Minister. These laws reflect the policy that determining tariffs is not a matter for the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_2396">Furthermore, Section 10A of the 1999 Act does not provide an adequate legal basis for a direction sought by and for the benefit of a private entity. The section provides that the Minister may only give directions on "general policy" as opposed to a specific direction in respect of the making of a particular decision by the regulator. Section 10A(6)(<i>c</i>) of the 1999 Act explicitly prohibits the Minister from giving a direction in respect of the performance of the functions of the CER “in relation to individual energy undertakings or persons”.</p>
            <p eId="para_2397">I am satisfied that any general policy direction I might make would have to operate in what I consider to be in the overall public interest and could not be framed so as to either assist or hinder a particular stakeholder or otherwise so as to undermine the regulatory system.  In the absence of any change in policy in respect of the regulation of gas tariffs, which I do not contemplate, and because of the limitations set out in the governing legislation surrounding the exercise of this power, I do not envisage making a Ministerial policy direction as sought by and on behalf of the company.</p>

            <p eId="para_2399">Salmon poaching on the River Laune is an ongoing concern.  Efforts at illegal netting are attempted by poachers throughout the year.  On average Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) confiscates in excess of 20 nets per year.  Illegal netting is predominantly attempted in the lower reaches of the River Laune, an area where access by IFI staff is extremely difficult.  Currently patrolling on the River Laune takes place seven days a week both by boat and on foot.  Over the last five years there have been five successful prosecutions for illegal fishing activity of which three resulted from the non-payment of On the Spot Fines (OTSF).  There have been some 15 OTSFs issued during that period.</p>

            <p eId="para_2403">Completion of the development works by the developer is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.  Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2404">Following receipt of the relevant statutory permits by the developer, works on the construction of the onshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline commenced in July 2011.  Oversight of these works is being undertaken by the appropriate authorities with respect to their respective consents i.e. Mayo County Council is charged with enforcement and compliance with the conditions of An Bord Pleanála's development permission pursuant to the Planning and Development Acts including the conditions with respect to the safety of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">With regard to the consents issued on 25 February, 2011 by the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources pursuant to the Gas and Petroleum Acts, I would like to advise that these contain a number of conditions specific to the safety and design of the project.  My Department has appointed independent consultants to assist in monitoring compliance with these conditions to ensure that the project is constructed in a safe manner.  It is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, including the construction of a 5km tunnel, will take in the region of three years.  First gas cannot therefore reasonably be anticipated before 2014.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_2464">I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 148 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2465">There has been significant growth in the take up of broadband services and contracted speeds in Ireland in recent years.  The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) has reported that between Q3 2007 and Q3 2011 the number of broadband subscribers has more than doubled from 793,000 to more than 1.6 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2466">It is also the case that, at the end of September 2011, 73.2% of domestic customers and 88.8% of business subscribers were contracted for services using speeds between 2Mbps-10Mbps compared to 52.5% and 30.3% respectively at end 2007, when ComReg commenced reporting in the current format.  Many subscribers are also migrating to higher speed products with 19.8% of residential subscribers using speeds in excess of 10Mbps, according to ComReg's latest Quarterly Report (Q3 2011), compared to 0.2% at end 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2467">International comparisons of broadband services are complex to measure and interpret.  In many instances, surveys measure an average of retail broadband speeds published on service providers' websites only.  These comparisons do not take account of higher speeds which are available in some countries (including Ireland) over leased lines to users of very high speeds and bandwidth.  The international comparisons only consider retail services that are advertised.  Big bandwidth leased line services are not advertised as retail services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2468">It is also the case that the comparisons are not weighted to take account of the number and variety of speeds options advertised.  Furthermore, broadband services that are advertised as part of a bundled package may not be included in such comparisons.  Some commonly used high speed broadband services, available in Ireland, such as triple play products, may not be included in some international comparisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2469">The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce which I convened last summer has an important role to play in this regard.  It comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss and report on policy issues and proposals in relation to the provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.  I expect that the Taskforce will help to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2470">The Taskforce will conclude its deliberations shortly.  It is my intention to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce and to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.</p>

            <p eId="para_2473">I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2474">I would like to advise the Deputy in the first instance that in relation to the specific issue of the potential use of hydraulic fracturing technology as part of a gas exploration or extraction project, my Department has not received applications for nor licensed the use of hydraulic fracturing in the Irish onshore at this time.  I can advise the Deputy however that the European Commission has issued a Guidance Note confirming that the exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons has to comply with the requirements of EU legislation.  A comprehensive legislative framework on environmental protection and access to hydrocarbon resources is already in place throughout Member States and applies to all hydrocarbons, conventional and unconventional from planning to the aftercare of sites following exploitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2475">I would also like to confirm that in October of last year, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte requested the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct research and to advise on the environmental implications of hydraulic fracturing as a means of extracting natural gas from underground reserves.  The EPA is currently funding preliminary background research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction and into the regulatory approaches of other countries with a view to helping to establish best environmental practice.  This research is in the form of a desk based study being carried out by the University of Aberdeen.</p>
            <p eId="para_2476">The EPA proposes to commission further, more extensive research on hydraulic fracturing in 2012 and a working group involving representatives from my Department and the EPA has been established to develop the scope for this study.  However, the final specification for this research will only be prepared after the EPA, which is an independent statutory body, has considered the output from the study currently underway at the University of Aberdeen.  I understand that the EPA expects to receive the report of that study in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_2497">EirGrid estimates that renewable generation was around 18% of the fuel mix in 2011.  Under the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC Ireland has been set a legally binding target for renewable energy as a proportion of all energy consumption that must be achieved by 2020.  The National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) sets out that this overall 16% target will be achieved through 40% consumption of renewables in the electricity sector, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heat sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">Renewable electricity is now the largest contributor to renewable energy consumption and is expected to contribute most to our 2020 target.  The largest contribution in the electricity sector is expected to be made through generation from wind technologies, followed by biomass technologies.  For the support of commercial renewable generation, my Department administers a renewable energy support mechanism known as the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT).</p>
            <p eId="para_2499">The latest modelling undertaken by the SEAI, (‘Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020' [2011]), indicates that capacity of around 4000MW of renewable generation will be required on the system to deliver the 40% renewable electricity target by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">In addition to the 1900MW already connected, there is around 1000MW from Gate 1 and Gate 2 which have contracted with the system operators and are scheduled to be built out and connected.  Around 4,000MW of additional renewable capacity is provided for in the Gate 3 process.  All Gate 3 offers have now issued, however it is not yet known what the final level of take-up of offers is.  This should become clear this year, when constraint reports are issued by EirGrid, following which those in receipt of offers will have a fixed period within which to accept offers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2505">Generators are regulated through the Commission for Energy Regulation's (CER) regulatory regime, in the main through their licences, and by the mandatory requirements placed on their participation in the Single Electricity Market (SEM).  The regulatory regime and the wholesale market rules apply to generators regardless of the ownership of electricity generation.  Such a framework ensures efficient and cost effective generation of electricity and provides generators with a transparent and stable regulatory framework which is a key consideration for investors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2506">The SEM is the wholesale electricity market for the island of Ireland, regulated jointly by the CER, the Utility Regulator.  By combining what were two separate jurisdictional electricity markets, the SEM became one of the first of its kind in Europe when it went live on 1st November 2007.  The SEM is designed to provide for the least cost source of electricity generation to meet customer demand at any one time across the island, while also maximising long-term sustainability, reliability and generation adequacy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2507">The SEM includes a centralised all-island gross mandatory pool (or spot) market.  In this pool, electricity is bought and sold through a market clearing mechanism whereby generators bid in their marginal cost and receive the System Marginal Price (SMP) for each trading period for their scheduled dispatch quantities, with the result that the cheapest possible generators are run to meet demand across the island.  Generators also receive constraint payments for the difference between the market schedule and the system dispatch.  Suppliers purchase energy from the pool and pay the SMP for each trading period along with capacity costs and system charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_2508">Under specific arrangements in the SEM, generators also receive separate payments in the form of capacity payments, which ensures they are paid regulated sums of money for providing available generation capacity to the market.  The Capacity Payments Mechanism (CPM) is administered by the SEM Committee, composed of both Regulators and independent membership.  The CPM is a key feature of the SEM design in order to encourage the provision of generation capacity.  By providing revenue to generators additional to market payments for generation, it provides a separate financial reward for generation capacity and, for this reason, a financial incentive for new entry and investment, which applies irrespective of ownership.</p>

            <p eId="para_2514">Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">The SEAI has recently renewed the contracts with 26 of the network of CBOs and hopes to conclude negotiations with the remainder at the earliest possible opportunity.  In addition, an Invitation to Tender was recently published by the SEAI to establish a new panel of private contractors to augment this network.  The public procurement process through the Official Journal of the European Union will take a number of weeks to conclude and a panel should be in place in May.</p>
            <p eId="para_2516">The SEAI advises that there is a total of 10,729 homes on the national waiting list as of 29 February 2012.  Service delivery plans, within the available 2012 budget, are currently being finalised.  Households on the waiting list on 31 December 2011 will be retrofitted according to their position on the waiting list.  65% on the waiting list are on the list six months or less.</p>
            <p eId="para_2517">There are 423 applications that date back to 2010 (approximately 4% of the overall list).  In the majority of cases efforts have been made by the SEAI or the relevant CBO to make contact with the homeowner or to survey the property.  The SEAI are in the process of writing to all the remaining homes currently on the list for more than one year with a view to confirming, or otherwise, their interest and eligibility for the scheme and to prioritise those valid and interested householders for delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2518">2012 will mark a shift in emphasis on the Better Energy: Warmer Homes scheme to take account of the Government's Affordable Energy Strategy, which I launched last November.  Heretofore, applicants were considered eligible for retrofit measures if they met defined criteria, such as eligibility for the National Fuel Scheme.  All successful applicants were placed on a waiting list and addressed in rotation.  The focus in 2012 will shift to addressing those households identified as being in extreme energy poverty as a priority; such households typically spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services.  This will ensure that those most in need receive the benefit of energy efficiency measures first.</p>

            <p eId="para_2534">Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2536">The Commissioner, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been reviewing various options for streamlining the valuation process and speeding up the national revaluation programme. In this regard, the Government recently approved the drafting of a Valuation Bill to amend the Valuation Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2537">Commercial rates income makes a significant contribution to the current funding requirements of local authorities. Rates provide the means by which local authorities can fund the services essential to communities, and therefore business, across the full range of local activities including roads, water and waste services, fire and emergency, libraries and a range of community, amenity and social activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2538">I have asked local authorities to exercise restraint in setting their Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in the context of the adoption of their 2012 budgets.  As of 05 March 2012, 73 of the 88 rating authorities have submitted their adopted Budgets to my Department. Across the 73 authorities, annual rates on valuation declined by an average of 0.35% from 2011 to 2012.  I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under consideration in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2544">Planning legislation provides for extensive public notification of proposed development. For example, article 17 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2010 requires an applicant to erect a site notice in order to lodge a valid application for planning permission. Article 19 of the Regulations requires that this notice must be placed in a conspicuous position on or near the main entrance from a public road to the land or structure concerned, so as to be easily visible and legible by persons using the public road. Alternatively, if the land or structure does not adjoin a public road, the site notice should be placed so as to be easily visible and legible by persons outside the land or structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">It is important to bear in mind, however, that although the notice must inform the public of the nature and extent of the application, it is only by examining the planning application lodged with the planning authority that a person will obtain full information on the proposed development.  The site notice must contain the date on which the site notice is erected and state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority and that a submission or observation in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing, on payment of the prescribed fee, within the 5 weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application. The applicant must erect the site notice no sooner than 2 weeks before making the application for permission in order to facilitate third party inspection of the application. Where it appears to a planning authority that any notice does not comply with these requirements, they may require the applicant to give further notice and evidence in relation to compliance with such a requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2546">Article 18 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006 also provides that a notice be published in a newspaper approved for this purpose.

The current notification system, which provides for both a newspaper notice and a site notice, is kept under regular review in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2548">The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has worked to assess the extent of the incidence of radon in Ireland, and to increase public awareness of the issue.  In 2002 the RPII published the report of the National Radon Survey of radon in homes in Ireland. The results of the national radon survey identified certain parts of the country which are prone to high levels of radon. Approximately one third of the country is classified as a High Radon Area. In Kerry the High Radon Areas are located in the north of the county around Tralee and Castleisland, where high  radon levels seem most pronounced and also in the west of the county close to Dingle. A map showing the High Radon Areas is published on the RPII's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">High radon levels can occur anywhere; however the RPII regards north Kerry as a priority area due to the frequency with which extremely high radon levels have been found in homes there.  The RPII has carried out several radon awareness initiatives locally, and a major public awareness effort will be undertaken in north Kerry next week.  The Kerry radon week will include of public meetings, press releases, advertising, local/national media interviews, a Facebook page as well as an information leaflet drop to all householders in the area advising them of the radon risk.  The Kerry radon week is carried out by the RPII working in collaboration with Kerry County Council and the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">The Government's approach to radon, which is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States, is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home. Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged by the RPII to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2551">Since 1998 the Building Regulations require all new buildings to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction. In October 2004 an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) was published incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This guidance document is aimed at ensuring that radon protection measures are carried out more effectively. Copies of the guidance documents are available on my Department's website —<i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2552">If a dwelling is found to have a high radon level, remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department, Radon in Buildings — Corrective Options, which is also available on my Department's website. The RPII has also issued guidance, Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householders Guide, which is available on the Institute's website at <i>www.rpii.ie</i>, together with a a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and offer specific advice and recommendations. In addition, the RPII can be contacted for radon advice on freephone 1800 300 600.</p>

            <p eId="para_2555">I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 158 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2556">As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2557">Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2558">Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2559">Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2560">Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2561">Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2562">the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2563">the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2564">the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2565">the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2566">the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; and,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2567">where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.</p>
            <p eId="para_2568">This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2569">Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. This list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012. A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end. Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_2570">Full details on the categorisation of estates, including in Kerry, can be found on my Department's (<i>www.environ.ie</i>) website as part of the National Housing Development Survey 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_2572">The Programme for Government provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure and to manage the domestic water metering programme. The Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the EU/IMF commits Ireland to undertaking an independent assessment of the establishment of such an authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2573">The first phase of work on the independent assessment has been completed.  The phase 1 report and a position paper setting out proposed reforms in the water sector was published as part of a public consultation phase which concluded recently.  The independent assessment concludes, based on an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the current system, international experience and stakeholder soundings, that Irish Water should be created as a public utility in a regulated environment.  The initial transition strategy envisages a staged approach involving:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2574">Appointment of an interim board and Project Management Office in 2012 pending the establishment of Irish Water under its own statute by mid 2013;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2575">Irish Water would acquire statutory responsibility for water services in mid 2013, with ownership of assets transferring from local authorities from that date;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2576">Local authorities would be agents of Irish Water for a period with Irish Water taking over their operations on a phased basis from January 2015;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2577">The full transfer of operations would be completed by end 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_2578">The next stage of the consultancy work involves the development of an implementation plan which will address transformation planning in more detail.</p>

            <p eId="para_2580">My Department's involvement with the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant schemes, introduced in November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority. It is a matter for each local authority to determine how the funding is apportioned between the various grant measures and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within the allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2581">Local authorities are responsible for the administration of the grant schemes and for ensuring that sufficient own resources funding is made available to support these schemes. Details of the amounts of own resources funding and numbers of grant applications on hand for each of the grant measures in each local authority are not available in my Department. Details of the Exchequer allocations to local authorities for 2012 together with information on the overall numbers of grants paid and the total amount of funding recouped by my Department to local authorities in 2010 and 2011 are set out in the table.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2832">As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2833">Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2834">Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2835">Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2836">Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2838">the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2839">the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2840">the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2841">the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2842">the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; and,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2843">where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.</p>
            <p eId="para_2844">In terms of the resolution of problems in unfinished housing developments the formulation of Site Resolution Plans (SRP) is a key tool. Such plans enable developers to work with local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites. The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership in a way that is in the best interests of residents.  As part of the work of the National Coordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments my Department has initiated a pilot project for the resolution of sites using the site resolution plan process. In this context, my Department has issued a working template in order to establish best practice in this area. I intend that the process, which is pivotal to the resolution of problem sites, will be used more extensively in the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2845">In addition, under the Public Safety Initiative my Department has made allocations totalling some €2.59 million to 21 local authorities from the €5 million funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues in 2011. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. A provision of €2m has been made for 2012 and my Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.</p>

          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_626">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2847">Directive 94/62/EC (as amended) on Packaging and Packaging Waste required Ireland to achieve recovery rates of 25% or more for packaging by 30 June 2001,  50% or more by 31 December 2005 and 60% by 31 December 2011.  Repak Limited was established in 1997 as a not for profit organisation  as the collective industry response to the need to meet Ireland's packaging waste recovery and recycling targets through promoting, co-ordinating and financing the collection and recovery of packaging waste. Repak operates as a packaging compliance scheme on the basis of an approval granted by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2848">Repak members pay a fee based on the nature and quantity of packaging which they place on the market. Repak's membership fees fund subsidies for each tonne of packaging waste recovered from commercial sources (e.g. backdoor waste from factories, shops) and from the post-consumer waste streams (green kerbside bins, civic amenity sites and bottle banks). This subsidy has been a vital incentive for household recycling in particular as it has enabled waste collectors to provide green bins at low or no cost to customers, thereby encouraging recycling and enabling Ireland to meet its EU targets. Repak does not provide subsidies for general household waste collection. As the packaging waste recovery subsidy is funded by industry to meet their requirements under the packaging Directive, it could also not be deemed to represent State aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_2849">The National Waste Report 2010   reported that Ireland is currently achieving a recovery rate of 74% of packaging waste, substantially exceeding the current EU Directive target of 60%.  With regard to household waste, the Programme for Government   contains a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers would bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2850">A public consultation designed to inform the policy development process concluded in September 2011. A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests.   A consensus is not apparent and, on almost all of the relevant issues, a considerable breadth of opinion was expressed. All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, are available on my Department's website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2851">I expect to be in a position to submit final proposals in relation to household waste collection to Government by Easter this year. All policy proposals will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives, including the issue of waiver schemes intended to support low income households.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_2855">The Deputy will recall that the Government announced in December last that it had decided not to proceed with legislation to abolish upward only rent reviews in existing commercial leases, i.e., those entered into prior to 28 February 2010.  There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, at this difficult time in our economic circumstances, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2856">While legislative intervention in this area may not be practicable, there is nothing to prevent landlords from engaging with their tenants in order to reach agreement on appropriate rent levels and the Government is strongly of the view that such engagement is highly desirable.  I would also note that the Minister for Finance, in the context of his budget speech, has outlined the role which NAMA can play in dealing with the problems caused by upward only rent reviews which apply to NAMA properties.</p>

            <p eId="para_2858">The Irish Central Authority for Child Abduction within my Department has not received an application in relation to this matter.  The Central Authority operates for the purpose of a number of international and EU instruments relating to child abduction. The purpose of these instruments is to facilitate the return of children who have been wrongfully removed from one contracting state where they are habitually resident to another contracting state.  As Egypt is not a contracting state to these international instruments, the Central Authority is not in a position to assist.  In such situations, the family involved can seek consular assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and I understand that Department has been assisting the family.</p>
            <p eId="para_2859">The decision to seek the extradition of a person charged with a criminal offence rests with the Director of Public Prosecutions and only arises where the Director has decided that a person should be prosecuted in the first instance.   As the Deputy will appreciate, the Director is independent in the exercise of his functions and, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I have no function in deciding whether a person should be charged with an offence or whether a person's extradition should be sought.</p>

            <p eId="para_2861">As I stated in my answer to Parliamentary Question number 232 on 15th February 2012, the moratorium on Public Service Recruitment continues to apply to An Garda Síochána and no date has been fixed for future intakes into the Garda College. A decision on when recruitment will re-commence will take into account the rate of retirements in the Garda Síochána and Government targets, set in the context of the agreement with the EU and the IMF, to reduce the numbers of public servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2862">In addition to this, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers, and therefore establish when recruitment will recommence, is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force, and the House will be conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2864">The new Legal Services Regulatory Authority to be established under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 will be independent of the legal professions and of the Government in the performance of its functions. This will include new and independent procedures relating to allegations of professional misconduct by either solicitors or barristers. Such complaints will be dealt with under the auspices of the Authority's Complaints Committee and supported, where appropriate, by the work of the new and independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. Under the Bill, members of the public will no longer go to the Law Society or to the Bar Council to make complaints, as happens at the moment, but will instead do so through the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2865">The Law Society has recently recognised that it would be "in the best interests of the public and the profession" if complaints about solicitors were no longer to be dealt with by the Society but by the new Regulatory Authority to be established under the Bill. The independence of the new Regulatory Authority and of its attendant complaints procedures is, therefore, fundamental to their success and to the avoidance of any perception that complaints about lawyers are being dealt with by lawyers themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_2866">The complaints systems currently operated by the legal professional bodies are to be replaced by new procedures the independence of which will have to be reflected in the relevant recruitment and appointment processes. In closing the Second Stage debate on the Bill, during which the Deputy made some very useful contributions in support of the interests of the public and consumers, I confirmed that I am considering possible Committee Stage amendments to create an appropriately independent procedure for the appointment of members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. Similarly, I expressed the view that staff appointments to the new Authority would be better made by the Authority itself under a public competition carried out by the Public Appointments Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2867">While the transition to a new and independent complaints procedure under the Bill will have an impact on staff currently involved in that area it will be open to such staff  — who would obviously possess the relevant skills and experience — to offer to apply for positions advertised by the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p>

Cases can be complex with applicants coming from over 90 different countries. In effect, consideration of these cases can amount to a reconsideration of earlier applications for refugee status.

            <p eId="para_2876">I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that an application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in April, 2010.  The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2877">The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2878">Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p>

My Department has informed me that the failure of the specialist to provide the necessary medical report in a timely fashion is unusual and is not representative of their experience of administering the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2889">I attach the highest priority to the full investigation of white collar crime and bringing the perpetrators of such crime to justice.  Within eight weeks of taking up office, I moved urgently to draft, and seek Government approval to the introduction of, additional legislation.  This new legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 2011, was enacted on 2 August.  The Act is an important step in delivering on the Government's commitment to tackle white collar crime.  Its main purpose is to address delays in the prosecution and investigation of complex white collar crime by improving certain important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2890">The Act's provisions are based on the experiences of those involved in investigations and prosecutions of white collar crime, and in particular on the experiences of those involved in current investigations into bank fraud and financial irregularities.  It provides new procedures and powers which will speed up both current and future investigations, including investigations into offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2891">The Programme for Government contains a commitment that rogue bankers and all those who misappropriate or embezzle funds are properly pursued for their crimes and that the full rigours of the law will apply to them.  I am determined to see this commitment fulfilled.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank by An Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) are ongoing with a full investigation team employed at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2892">The Garda authorities have indicated that to date two investigation files were submitted by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation to the Law Officers in December, 2010.  A supplementary file was submitted in May 2011 and a further investigation file was forwarded in October 2011.  The files remain under consideration by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and directions are awaited.  Following recent developments additional information has been submitted to the Law Officers to allow matters to be considered further.</p>
            <p eId="para_2893">I can assure the Deputy that this Government will continue to provide the necessary legislative and administrative supports for the investigations and that I attach the highest priority to the full investigation of white collar crime and bringing the perpetrators of such crime to justice.  I am being briefed on an ongoing basis on the progress of the investigations and am assured that this investigation remains an absolute priority for An Garda Síochána and that there is sufficient personnel and technical expertise available to assist in the various aspects of this ongoing investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2895">I should say at the outset that it would be inappropriate for me to give legal advice by way of answer to a Parliamentary Question. Moreover, this is further underscored by the fact that the Minister for Justice and Equality is in law responsible for the operation of our immigration legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2896">The situation as presented to the Deputy appears to constitute a clear breach of the law over a sustained period and as such that cannot be ignored. Ireland like all other countries is entitled to uphold its sovereign right to manage its borders to ensure, inter alia, that the State is not, for example, left in a situation where it has to take on financial and/or welfare obligations in respect of persons who have flouted our laws.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">I would say by way of general comment that the person in question should immediately contact in writing the Immigration Service of my Department — General Immigration Section, Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 — to set out the circumstances of her case, how she entered and remained in the State together with any extenuating factors. Pending an examination of her case, I am not in a position to make any further comment at this stage. However, I would say that, at a minimum, continued disregard of law would most certainly be adverse to her interests.</p>

            <p eId="para_2900">I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2901">The Probate Office is an office of the High Court.  Management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that there are 14 District Probate Registries located outside Dublin attached to Circuit Court Offices.  Staff in these offices are not exclusively assigned to probate work and also have responsibility for other aspects of circuit court work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2902">I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that the Courts Service, in common with all other public sector organisations, is obliged to ensure that resources are deployed to best effect to ensure continuity of service with reduced budgets and resources.  Greater flexibility in the deployment of available resources will be critical in maintaining the delivery of front line court services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2903">The Court Service has informed me that the impact of vacancies on the provision of services will vary between court offices depending on the numbers retiring and the skill sets available in each office. The Service has put in place contingency plans which are being customised to meet the needs of individual offices, including the Galway Circuit Court Office which the Deputy has raised. These plans include technical skills training to address the skills and knowledge deficit resulting from retirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2904">The Courts Service has put in place a series of work force planning measures over the last three years to ensure that available resources are deployed to best effect including the centralising of processes, creation of multi jurisdictional combined court offices, rationalisation of court venues and offices, rationalisation and standardisation of processes and an ongoing review of resource allocation including redeployment to front line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2905">The table sets out the overall number of staff and vacancies in each Circuit Court office which has a District Probate Registry. The table also sets out the number of recently retired staff who were involved in work in the District Probate Registries.</p>

            <p eId="para_2973">I am advised by the Garda authorities that Operation Raptor was established by local Garda management in Waterford, in conjunction with personnel from the Garda National Drugs Unit, to target the illegal sale, supply and distribution of drugs in the Waterford area. As part of the Operation test purchases were conducted between June and December 2011, which have given rise to in excess of forty investigation files being submitted to the Law Officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2974">Furthermore, on 29 February 2012, a search and arrest phase of this initiative was undertaken during which twenty searches were carried out, resulting in the arrest of seventeen persons. The persons concerned were brought before Waterford District Court and charged with offences relating to the illegal supply of controlled drugs, principally heroin and cocaine. Pending further court hearings involving these cases, no convictions have as yet been secured. It is anticipated that further arrests will follow as a result of this ongoing policing operation.  I am further informed that the monetary value of drugs seized during this initiative would be relatively small, with street deals worth between approximately €20-€80 each being purchased in the course of the operation by undercover officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2975">A dedicated budget was not established for this initiative. It would therefore necessitate a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to calculate the cost of the operation to date.  An Garda Síochána remains fully committed to continuing to tackle the illegal supply of drugs at all levels, in keeping with commitments under the National Drugs Strategy.  A key feature of this work is the ongoing close co-operation between the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Garda Drugs Units to ensure  a co-ordinated and effective approach to drug law enforcement and the protection of our communities.</p>

In addition to this, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers, and therefore establish when recruitment will recommence, is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force, and the House will be conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.

            <p eId="para_3003">While there is no getting away from the reality that public expenditure and public service numbers have to be reduced in the context of the agreement with the EU and the IMF, the Government is committed to maintaining frontline services at the highest level possible.

The number of retirements in the first two months of 2012 was 262. This compares with 436 in 2011, 362 in 2010 and 722 in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_3005">The primary purpose of section 63 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 is to ensure that the driving licence number of individual offenders is recorded to enable the application of appropriate penalty points to the licence on conviction by the court.  I am informed that the Courts Service are making arrangements to have the wording on the summonses amended to inform those summoned to court that they must bring not only their driving licence but a copy of the licence to court to facilitate the recording of the driving licence number.  In addition, the Service is in the process of introducing new procedures which will enhance its ability to record not only the driving licence number but also to record, as a matter of record, whether the licence is produced or not.</p>
            <p eId="para_3006">The Courts Service computer system does not support the maintenance of statistical data in relation to whether or not a driving licence is produced.

            <p eId="para_3009">The Garda authorities have indicated that at present the armed capability of Garda members is provided by District Detective Units supported by National Units.  In addition, they have made arrangements to co-ordinate Garda armed response measures throughout the country.  These arrangements include special responses to deal with different types of crime.  In view of the operational nature of the functions involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment in further detail on how the relevant resources might be deployed.  The Garda authorities have also informed me that the armed capability of Garda members is kept under ongoing review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3024">The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for over 19,000 organisations in Ireland who are registered with the Gardaí for this purpose and which employ/engage persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  Amongst these organisations are the Teaching Council, with whom primary and secondary school teachers are registered, and various Third Level institutions.  Vetting is carried out in response to written requests made through these registered organisations on behalf of the individual who is to be vetted. As the GCVU only has responsibility for processing the applications it receives from, and issuing the response to, these organisations, it is not in a position to say what percentage of the entire cohort of primary and secondary teachers or third level lecturers have been vetted to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3025">However, following inquiries with the Department of Education and Skills, I understand that there are approximately 73,000 teachers registered with the Teaching Council of whom approximately 30,000 have been vetted under the arrangements for vetting of teaching staff introduced in 2006. I am further informed that in late 2010 the Department of Education and Skills issued a circular which updated and clarified the requirements for Garda vetting as part of recruitment procedures for all teaching and non-teaching positions. I am also advised by that Department that with regard to third level lecturers, the higher education institutions are autonomous statutory bodies and they deal directly with the management of their staff and related issues such as vetting through the GCVU.</p>

            <p eId="para_3037">Since 2007 all GM feed proposals have been considered in joint application with "food" under EU Regulation 1829/2004 on genetically modified food and feed.

            <p eId="para_3043">It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland's total land area. From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland's Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, any proposed change to Scheme criteria requires the agreement of the EU Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_3044">The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme will be reduced from €220 million to €190 million and, in order to achieve the €30 million saving in expenditure, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012. This reduction will arise from technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose main farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3045">The savings will be achieved without the need to reduce the existing rates of aid and, in addition, there will also be no reduction in the maximum area payable — 34 hectares. The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the payments under the Scheme are focused on those farmers, who (i) are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, (ii) make a significant contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and (iii) contribute to the enhancement of the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3046">There are an increasing number of applicants under the Scheme, who have discontinued livestock (cattle or sheep) farming, but who continue to benefit from aid under the Scheme by grazing some horses on their land. It is proposed that horses and donkeys will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation on the basis that these applicants' contribution to the rural economy is minimal. However, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy. My officials have engaged with the horse industry representatives in order to agree on criteria that would mean that those equine breeding enterprises (irrespective of their size), who are making a valuable contribution to the local economy will continue to receive support.</p>

Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue. During these checks a query arose in relation to the claimed Natura area on one of the parcels. This problem is presently being addressed and I expect payment will issue shortly.</p>

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_664">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_3058">It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland's total land area.  From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland's Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, any proposed change to Scheme criteria requires the agreement of the EU Commission. My intention is that the changes announced in the context of the recent Budget will be submitted to Brussels shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3059">The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme will be reduced from €220 million to €190 million and, in order to achieve the €30 million saving in expenditure, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012. At this stage it is not possible to break this figure down by measure and by county. This reduction will arise from technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose main farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3060">The savings will be achieved without the need to reduce the existing rates of aid and, in addition, there will also be no reduction in the maximum area payable — 34 hectares. The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the payments under the Scheme are focused on those farmers, who (i) are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, (ii) make a significant contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and (iii) contribute to the enhancement of the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3061">It is proposed that eligible applicants in 2012 must have met (a) a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per hectare in 2011 (equivalent to 2 ewes per hectare) and (b) 0.15 livestock units per hectare in 2012. However, in recognition of the environmental objectives of the Scheme, specific provisions will be made for those farmers, who had a stocking density less than 0.3 lu/ha in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure. If the proposals are accepted, all applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 lu/ha in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density. The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process. It is also intended that provision will be made for new entrants to farming.</p>
            <p eId="para_3062">It is proposed to continue with the minimum stocking density of 0.15 lu/ha in respect of 2012. With a view to focusing the aid to those farmers, who make the most significant contribution to the rural economy and to the environment in general, it is proposed that the calculation of the stocking density will be based on (a) a retention period of 6 months where the stocking density on the holding has to be equal to or greater than 0.15 lu/ha and (b) the stocking density calculated over the twelve months of the scheme-year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3063">With the intention of targeting those farmers who are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, it is proposed that farmers, whose holdings consists of land situated both in Disadvantaged Areas and non-Disadvantaged Areas are better positioned from a farming viewpoint than those farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas. Therefore, it is proposed that where some of an applicant's declared land,   whose main holding is situated in a non-Disadvantaged Area, is non-Disadvantaged land, a digressive of aid under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme will be payable to such farmers. This proposal is regarded as fair in that the greater proportion of Less Favoured Areas land in the holding the greater the level of payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3064">There are an increasing number of applicants under the Scheme, who have discontinued livestock (cattle or sheep) farming, but who continue to benefit from aid under the Scheme by grazing some horses on their land. It is proposed that horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation on the basis that these applicants' contribution to the rural economy is minimal. However, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3065">It is also proposed to exclude land situated more than 80 kilometres from a farmer's holding from aid under the Scheme. This exclusion will be confined to applicants, whose main holding is situated in a non-Disadvantaged Area, and who declares land situated more than 80 kilometres from the main holding. It is contended that the local impact of the farming of those lands situated in the Disadvantaged Areas is marginal.</p>

Owing to the variable nature of the process in respect of each individual country, and the need to engage with legal experts in the country being assessed, there is no definitive or set timescale for the completion of such reviews.  The AAI will provide all relevant information relating to reviews on its website at the appropriate time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3085">The Hague Convention is a formal state-to-state agreement between countries developed on a multilateral basis.  If a country has ratified the Hague Convention then the Adoption Authority of Ireland may establish administrative arrangements, as provided for in Section 72 of the Adoption Act, 2010.  Administrative agreements are designed to underpin the Hague process and are related to the sequence and process arrangements in place to support the safeguards already agreed between states.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland works with central authority counterparts in the establishment of administrative agreements.</p>

The foreseeable requirements for an intermediate care service have been based on the needs of  hospitals, taking into account the impact of the HSE's Clinical Care Programmes and the Government's Employment Control Framework.  Despite these challenges, the NAS has, over the past year, successfully put in place an intermediate care service in areas such as Limerick, Castleblayney and Galway and has developed plans to put a long term service in place in Mallow, Roscommon and Bantry.

            <p eId="para_3115">Under Universal Health Insurance, everyone will be insured for health care and the current unfair discrimination between public and private patients will be removed.  In the meantime, I am focusing on addressing the problems of the current private health insurance market, where insurers have a considerable financial incentive to cover younger, better risks rather than older, poorer risks.  I am particularly concerned that private health insurance is becoming harder to afford, especially for older people, as insurers increasingly tailor their insurance plans towards younger, healthier customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3116">I am strongly committed to protecting community rating, whereby older and less healthy customers should pay the same amount for the same cover as younger and healthier people.  In order to protect community rating, we need a system of Risk Equalisation which ensures that community rating can survive.  We have an Interim Scheme in place since 2009.  It is designed to compensate insurers which have older, less healthy customers and therefore higher claims costs, compared to insurers which have younger, less costly customers.  It does so by a system of tax credits, based on age, in respect of persons of 60 years and over.  Without such a system, community rating cannot survive.</p>
            <p eId="para_3117">In order to keep down the cost of health insurance for older people, I was pleased recently to increase significantly the age-related income tax credit for insured persons aged 60 years and over, from 1 January 2012.  Without this support, health insurers would have had a strong financial incentive to "segment" the market by offering policies targeted at young people, to the disadvantage of older customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3118">I must emphasise that these measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, the old and the young.  The increased tax credits for older people are balanced by a corresponding increase in the levy on each insurer in respect of all of its insured customers, so that the system is Exchequer neutral.</p>
            <p eId="para_3119">In addition, I am keen to explore other available measures to limit the costs related to health insurance.  I met recently with the three commercial health insurers to establish a Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, which met for the first time on 21st February.  It agreed to work cooperatively to examine the potential to drive down costs related to health insurance and to identify savings that could be achieved by both public and private hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3120">I am very concerned that any inefficiency in the management of claims is addressed before the introduction of Universal Health Insurance.  The VHI will play a key role in addressing costs in the market, as due to the age profile and health status of its customer base, it currently pays out about 80% of all claims in the market as a whole.  A new review of the VHI's claims costs will be carried out to establish what further savings can be made and it is expected that it will contribute significantly to more effective cost control within the private health insurance market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3121">The Government's clear objective is for the health insurance market to remain as competitive and affordable as possible, as we move towards a new system of Universal Health Insurance.  I am determined that the measures outlined above will have a significant impact in containing the level of any future increases in health insurance premiums.</p>

            <p eId="para_3125">The cumulative impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years presents a significant challenge for the health system generally in delivering services.  The priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  Like other care areas, efficiency and other savings will be required from the mental health service and it will have to deal with its share of staff reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3126">The HSE's Service Plan includes a commitment to reduce acute in-patient capacity by a minimum of 153 beds nationally in 2012, in line with the recommendations of <i>A Vision for Change.  </i>A key priority for the HSE is the reconfiguration of acute in-patient services and the redeployment of staff resources away from old institutional settings or over-provision of  acute in-patient beds towards community based services.  In that regard, a special allocation of €35 million for mental health was announced in Budget 2012 in line with the Programme for Government commitments.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children’s mental health services.  Approximately 400 additional staff will be recruited to support these and other initiatives in mental health.</p>
            <p eId="para_3127">In the context set out above, planning for staff exits from mental health as well as across the wider health service commenced in October last year and is continuing through the transition phase.  The plans reflect the fact that the number of staff leaving varies from region to region and from service to service.  The HSE is seeking to mitigate the impact of the retirements on frontline services by, among other measures, using the provisions of the Public Service Agreement to bring about greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, redeployment and other changes to achieve more efficient delivery of services.</p>

            <p eId="para_3133">I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_3134">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day case surgery.  As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Alan Kelly)</from>
            <p eId="para_3197">Following a recent Government decision, I announced plans on 28 February 2012 to achieve greater levels of transport integration and co-ordinated delivery across a range of exchequer funded local and rural transport services incorporating the RTP, HSE non-acute transport, school transport and voluntary transport initiatives. A key element of this decision was that the National Transport Authority (NTA) assume a national role for integrated local and rural transport. This will involve the Authority taking responsibility for the Rural Transport Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3198">The NTA will develop proposals for future integrated local and rural transport services based on a series of pilot projects to be undertaken. The pilots will trial how integrated local and rural transport services can operate and how savings can be achieved across the various transport services. I am currently finalising arrangements for the six pilot areas. The outcome of the pilot areas will inform the wider national roll-out of integrated rural transport services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3199">I am also establishing a high level committee to oversee the initiative and this committee will be led by the NTA. The committee will also include representatives of the Departments of Education and Skills and Health, Bus Éireann, HSE, Local authorities, Rural Transport Groups and Pobal as well as from my Department.  I strongly believe that by co-ordinating the resources we have available across a number of areas, we can further enhance and optimise the wider transport service offering in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3200">My Department has provided €9.77 million for the support of the rural transport programme nationally for 2012. In advance of the outcome of the pilot schemes it is essential that groups such as those in Galway continue to drive efficiencies and integration locally in order to minimise the impact of reduced funding on services. I will be asking the NTA to work with Pobal and groups to also support this effort by focussing on achieving efficiencies in administration costs in 2012.  Developing a more integrated and effective rural transport programme is now a priority for Government and I intend to take a very active role in pushing this forward as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_3216">The regulation of the taxi industry, including issues pertaining to the renewal and transfer of vehicle licences, is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3217">Currently, certain categories of SPSV vehicle licences are non-transferable, meaning they are individual to the person to whom they are issued and cannot be sold to a different person.  A similar arrangement exists for taxi licences issued since January 2009.  It was considered by the Review Group that it was necessary to move away from a system whereby a licence will have value in itself — a licence should determine a person's suitability to carry out a function and it should not have monetary value or be traded on the open market.  An anomaly exists in that taxi licences issued prior to 1 January 2009 can be sold or transferred on one occasion.  The Review Group agreed to introduce a prohibition on the transferability of taxi vehicle licences such that after 1 October 2012 all taxi vehicle licences will be unique to the person to whom the licence has been issued and cannot be transferred or sold to another individual.</p>
            <p eId="para_3218">The Taxi Regulation Act 2003 does not provide a basis for the application of a set retirement age. SPSV driver licensing is currently the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.  An applicant must satisfy the Gardaí that he/she is a fit and proper person to hold a licence and has not been convicted of an offence that would render him/her unsuitable to hold such a licence.  I will arrange for your correspondence to be forwarded to the NTA for any additional information the NTA considers appropriate.

        <b> Deputy Arthur Spring</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</b>
         if he is satisfied with the current system of pre-qualifying for the framework agreement for roadmarking for public works contracts, where the process of self declaration is widely used as self-declaration only requires the main contractor to sign a confirmation of their compliance with the registered employment agreement and not the submittal of the rates of pay and conditions of employment certificate or other compliance certificate in view of the fact that currently there is no requirement for the main contractor or his sub-contractors to provide evidence of compliance with current employment legislation here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3226">As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme. The planning, design and maintenance of individual national primary and secondary roads are matters for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Similarly, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory function of each road authority within its area, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.</p>
            <p eId="para_3227">I would also like to point out that works such as those mentioned by the Deputy are tendered out by the NRA and Local Authorities according to the criteria promulgated by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Details of the requirements are available on the e-Tenders website at <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>.</p>
