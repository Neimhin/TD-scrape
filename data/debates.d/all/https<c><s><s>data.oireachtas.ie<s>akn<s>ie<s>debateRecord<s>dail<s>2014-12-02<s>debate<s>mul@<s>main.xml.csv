#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	I wish to pass on my condolences to the family of Mr. Corrie, the gentleman who, unfortunately, was found deceased on our streets yesterday. I join the Archbishop and others in their request for a forum to be put together. By way of response, I commend the Minister on coming forward with a suggestion for Thursday. We might talk outside the Chamber to establish who exactly may be willing to attend such an event, which is essential.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	That is no problem.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	The question relates to the issue of the €60 million that was not due to be paid by Irish Water to local authorities according to the Minister the week before last. How did the Department arrive at that figure? My information indicates that the only two counties that have had up-to-date valuations carried out at this time are Dublin and Waterford. While many other counties had not provided for income to be derived from this area in their forthcoming budgets, there was an understanding that income would accrue to them in future once valuations were complete. It was alleged that €11 billion worth of assets in the form of networks, plant, machinery and so forth associated with Irish Water was transferred from local authorities, as against €60 million as an indicative figure. Is €60 million simply an indicative figure or as per my question? Can an indication be given as to the loss that may accrue to each local authority throughout the State? Can this be ascertained? Can alternatives be put in place to guarantee that the Local Government Fund will substitute those funds?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I assure Deputy Cowen that the local authorities will not be at a loss. There are three key elements to the Government's recent decision on water charges - we sought to make them more affordable, as everyone knows; we sought to provide certainty in respect of the charges; and we sought to put in place a more complete charging structure.In making the charges more affordable, the Government carefully examined Irish Water's operational expenditure. Irish Water's allowed revenue, which was approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation, continues to apply save for the impact of a changed approach to commercial rates for water services infrastructure. Such rates were considered by the regulator to be an uncontrollable or pass-through cost for Irish Water. In other words, they go straight through. By introducing an exemption from rates for any land or infrastructure used for the provision of public water services, the pass-through cost will no longer form part of Irish Water's operational expenditure. Local authorities will not suffer any loss of revenue as my Department will pay equivalent amounts to each authority from the local government fund to replace the anticipated income from rates. The total budgeted amount for rates payments by Irish Water in 2015 is €59 million. I will shortly bring forward legislation to give effect to the Government decision to provide an exemption from rates for water services infrastructure. While there was no prior engagement with the County and City Management Association or the Local Government Management Agency on this issue, my Department will be engaging with local authorities in relation to the process for payment of the compensating amounts in respect of the rates revenue foregone in 2015. That process is already under way.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	While I welcome the Minister's response, I am at a loss at his statement that no local authority will be at a loss when no local authority outside Dublin and Waterford had established what revenue would accrue from the commercial rates to be paid by Irish Water. The Minister said there was no consultation or discussion with the management association on the proposal and the decision. I need further proof from the Department as to how the figure of €59 million was arrived at and how it breaks down across the country. I need to know into the future that local authorities can definitively be satisfied that there will be no loss to them in funding vis-à-vis the local government funding model over the coming years. No valuations were carried out and there was no indication of what the valuation was. There was no idea as to what the income stream would be. Therefore, how can the Minister quantify the sum and will he break down the €59 million across the 34 local authorities?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	The Deputy can be fully assured definitively that local authorities will not be at a loss as part of this process. While there were no discussions within the timeframe with the LGMA or CCMA, discussions are ongoing on a continuous basis on all these issues anyway. There will be no effect on local authorities. The €59 million figure is believed to be the cost and it was arrived at through the analysis done with the Department and its discussions, which are ongoing as is always the case. I assure the Deputy that no local authority will be at a loss through this process. This is a pass-through cost and whatever pass-through amount per local authority is necessary will be the one that is given through. It will be supplemented and this mechanism is one we chose to put forward as part of the changes we brought through on water in the last couple of weeks. There is no intention in any way, shape or form to bring about any negative effect for local authorities. In relation to the breakdown of the €59 million, I will by all means share the figures with the Deputy when I have them to hand.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	I am very anxious that those figures are made available to the House as I have asked in written form and now orally but have yet to be provided with them by the Department.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	The Deputy will get them.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I find it very difficult to understand how a figure could be arrived at - specifically €59 million - by the Department when no valuations were carried out by 32 of the 34 local authorities. While it may be believed that the values applicable were such that the rates would only generate €59 million, we must see it on paper and contrast it across the different regions.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	We are very confident about the analysis that was made and the €59 million figure. When there is a breakdown in 2015, we will be able to supply the figures, as will be required. The Deputy has raised this issue previously and I am aware of his concern in this regard, but I assure him that this process will not leave local authorities at a loss. That was never the intention and, as the Minister with responsibility for local government, it would not be in my interest for any such loss to arise. While the Deputy's concerns are noted, I assure him local authorities will not be at a loss.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	Deputy Barry Cowen referred to the unfortunate death of John Corrie on the streets of Dublin two days ago. I join him in extending my sympathy to Mr. Corrie's family and friends. A new house building programme has been announced. While everyone welcomes the provision of new housing, the problem is in the here and now. Temperatures fell below 0° Celsius during the night and will remain very low for the rest of the week. I see empty buildings all over the place. With good will, some of them could be used to house the homeless. In this regard, I welcome the initiative taken today by the Archbishop of Dublin. I ask the Minister to do everything in his power to address the problem.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	The Deputy must address the question.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	I ask the Minister to clarify the position on the Irish derogation from the water framework directive of 2000 which has been discussed again recently.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I should have indicated previously that subsequent questions dealt with social housing and homelessness. I concur with the comments made by Deputies Barry Cowen and Brian Stanley on this issue. They are probably aware of the announcement I made earlier today. We will address the issue in subsequent questions. Article 9 of the water framework directive of 2000 requires member states to take account of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services in accordance with the well known principle that the polluter pays. Article 9(4) of the directive states member states are not in breach of the directive if they decide, in accordance with established practices, not to apply the provisions of the recovery of costs for a given water use activity where this does not compromise the purposes and achievement of the objectives of the directive. However, Ireland does not have any specific derogation from the directive. I emphasise this point as I have read analysis and commentary to the contrary.  The Government's policy on water charges is fully consistent with the objectives of the water framework directive and reflects the commitment entered into as part of the Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, 2010 to 2013, agreed between the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government and the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The programme for Government commits to introducing a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water and establishing a new State owned utility to take responsibility for water infrastructure. The new, more sustainable funding model being put in place through the establishment of Irish Water will allow for the investment required to ensure our water infrastructure can meet demographic and economic needs and comply with the requirements of the water framework directive in respect of the water environment.  In line with Government policy and the provisions of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The package of measures I announced in the House on 19 November provides clarity and certainty and will ensure water charges are affordable for customers. Legislation will be introduced in the House later this week to underpin this package of measures.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	The issue of a derogation from the water framework directive is being discussed and Article 9(4) is receiving specific attention. It is interesting to note the Minister's comment that Ireland does not have a derogation from the directive. Did we have a derogation at any stage? If so, was the Government notified that it was being removed and the grounds on which it was being removed?Was its removal part of an arrangement with the troika and the previous Government when it signed the memorandum of understanding? Article 9(4) offers a way of dealing with things differently, stating: Member States shall not be in breach of this Directive if they decide in accordance with established practices not to apply the provisions of paragraph 1, second sentence, and for that purpose the relevant provisions of paragraph 2, for a given water-use activity, where this does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the objectives of this Directive. The Minister has a number of options, such as conservation.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	This has been bandied about, and there have been different interpretations in previous years. We do not have a derogation. As a consequence of the circumstances of the country, our current situation and that of the past number of years, and the manner in which the agreement with the troika was signed up to by the previous Administration, not only do we not have a derogation, but, as a result of our circumstances, we do not have a derogation because we have committed, as the Deputy is fully aware, to the introduction of the model we have developed. It is important that we discuss the water framework directive and the necessity for us to be compliant with it. Without investment of the level required, we simply will not be in compliance with it in any way, shape or form. We all know the reasons for that and the situations with which we have to deal across the country. It is for this reason that we have adopted this policy. It has happened out of necessity because, as a country, we had no choice.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	The Minister clearly has options, according to Article 9(4). He could have chosen a policy of conservation and shown he is achieving the objectives of the directive. That could be done through building regulations, water harvesting, particularly in larger buildings, or the roll-out of a large-scale water education and awareness programme.  The Minister will recall that about 15 years ago it was in vogue in this country to say that Irish people would not recycle. We now have one of the best recycling rates in the EU, which is good, and we should have more of it. We cannot do too much. Irish people will conserve water. It is an option.  The €800 million or so that has been spent has not been spent on fixing leaks; rather, it has been spent on establishing Irish Water and the cost of metering, which was €539 million. That money would have repaired an awful lot of mains. We could save water and achieve the purpose of the directive.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	I have heard these arguments. We do not have options of the scale to which he referred. However, that is not to say we should not be implementing some of the measures he mentioned to a larger degree. I agree with him completely about conservation. It is a necessity that we, as a society, adopt a similar approach in our conservation policy to that which pertains to recycling. The Government will take further measures on this in the coming months and years. The real issue is that the level of investment required across the State to meet the requirements is colossal. Billions of euro will be required over the next number of years to begin dealing with the problems we have with water infrastructure in the country. It would be impossible to be in compliance with the directive if we did not adopt our current approach.. Look what is happening in Arklow, where a case is being taken due to the fact that there is raw sewage running into the Avoca river.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	On behalf of the Technical Group I offer my sincere condolences to the family of the young man who died in what can only be described as unacceptable circumstances, namely, without a bed or a roof over his head. It is unacceptable that such a thing could happen in Ireland today, which has a relatively small population of 4.5 million people. I thank the Minister for the initiative he is due to announce on Thursday. I am sure he will do everything in his power to deal with this inherently poor and desperate situation. How much revenue is Waterford City and County Council set to recoup next year from Irish Water and how much of this will be made up by overall pay costs to do with water supply and wastewater treatment by the council as an agent of Irish Water? Will the Minister provide a percentage for how much of the overall earnings of the council this figure represents? For how much does the council invoice Irish Water in operational costs every month and has Irish Water indicated that it will seek a reduction in what it will pay the council in the future?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	I do not know if the Deputy was present when I commented on the issue of homelessness, but it will be addressed in later questions. In December 2013 all of the local authorities signed individual service level agreements with Irish Water. Under these agreements, local authorities are conducting certain water services such as operations and maintenance of plants on behalf of Irish Water. I have no role in agreeing individual service level agreements which are operational matters for individual local authorities and Irish Water. However, I understand from Irish Water that Waterford City and County Council has been paid some €12.2 million to the end of October 2014 under the agreed service level agreement.  As well as in-built reviews of a service level agreement after two and seven years, there are annual service plans with agreed objectives and standards of performance, set against a budget covering headcount, goods and services and investment in the forthcoming year. Agreement on the annual service plan is a collaborative process between Irish Water and each of the local authorities and their representative bodies. The 2015 process is well under way and it is expected that annual service plans for 2015 will be agreed shortly. Until these plans are finalised, it is not be possible to give a breakdown per local authority for 2015.  A key objective of both the service level agreements and the annual service plans is to maintain service levels for all users of public water and waste water services. Meeting the new uniform regulatory requirements and standards and the regulator’s customer requirements is at the heart of the 2015 annual service plans.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	My understanding is that local authorities will continue to provide water services as agents of Irish Water. The cost of providing these services vis-à-vis payroll costs and a portion of the councils' central management charges will be recouped directly by Irish Water. However, it is likely that Irish Water will seek a reduction in what it will pay councils. There are considerable financial and operational uncertainties around this issue. For instance, will local authorities face significant operational and financial risks if the service level agreements, as agreed, are not honoured in full by Irish Water? For example, operating costs in the utility company, to date, have been twice those of its UK counterparts. When set up Irish Water signed a 12 year service level agreement with more than 4,000 local authority workers and there are major concerns about pension liabilities. Will the Minister clarify whether if the pension liabilities of Waterford City and County Council staff and others who moved to Irish Water were transferred to the new employer?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	On the last issue, I presume everything has been done appropriately. If the Deputy has a specific question on the issue, I will get back to him directly if he sends his query to me. The requirements in this regard are set out, but I do not have a direct role in the matter. However, I am intent on ensuring the review process for the service level agreements will be conducted in a comprehensive manner. A review process will take place after two years and seven years. A framework has been agreed and is in place. Each year an agreement must be put in place and issues identified will be dealt with in a suitable manner. Some issues will be unique to a particular local authority and Irish Water will engage on them. To date, I have no reason for concern in my dealings with Irish Water or the local authorities. I deal with both sides of the coin.I have seen no concerns to date that would give rise to any form of alarm.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I wonder whether water charges will be used to pay off huge legacy debts incurred by councils over the years, for example, overruns on contract failures on various capital projects. My information is that many local authorities have already had to borrow money to settle contractual claims and legal disputes. For example, in Waterford city, substantial legal costs and settlements of €4 million were paid to a contractor following a dispute in 2010. We were recently told by Irish Water that it will take on between €100 million and €130 million in debt from uncollected commercial water charges. Can the Minister give any indication of the extent of liabilities which will be transferred to Irish Water for debts such as unpaid development levies or loans various councils drew down for expensive investment projects on budgets that went by the wayside?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	The figures quoted by the Deputy are broadly accurate. Irish Water does have a role and is taking on what it needs to take on. However, it is a case-by-case scenario and it obviously has to be very prudent and has to do this in the right manner. If the Deputy has a specific concern in regard to water or a specific project in mind, while I do not have that level of detail available here, I would be quite happy to get the Deputy an answer, one on one. I must repeat that a huge amount of rigour has been gone through in how Irish Water is dealing with those cases and the legacy issues to ensure there is value for the taxpayer and that this is appropriately managed. I can give many examples where success stories have emanated because of Irish Water. The biggest one, which, to be fair, everyone has acknowledged, is at the Ringsend plant close to here, where a huge amount of capital investment has been saved due to the establishment of Irish Water. There are examples all over the country. This is a very positive thing. The saving in regard to Ringsend alone is equal to the set-up cost of Irish Water.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	As the Minister is probably aware, the community development companies in the non-Gaeltacht islands play a vital role in sustaining the communities on the islands. There are five such companies, based on Clare Island, Inishturk, Inishbofin, Sherkin Island with associated other small islands in Cork, and Bere Island. Does the Minister intend to provide funding, which is in the region of €500,000 a year, to the development companies on the islands after March 2015? I know the Minister has cover until that date so I am interested in his plans after March 2015.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	To be fair, the Deputy has raised this issue with me on previous occasions. My Department’s local and community development programme, LCDP, is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State. The current programme officially ended at the end of 2013, having operated for four years, with funding of €281 million over that period. As the Deputy noted, it is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014, with a budget of €47 million pending the roll-out of the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, in April 2015. I believe it was the appropriate and necessary decision to make that intervention. My Department currently provides LCDP funding to Comhar na nOileán Teoranta - the local development company for the islands - for the delivery of LCDP to off-shore islands. In terms of the successor programme, SICAP, the intention is that island areas would be eligible for inclusion within the tendering process which is currently under way and is due to be completed in February 2015. The SICAP funding allocations are informed by a specific resource allocation model, otherwise known as RAM, which focuses on the relative disadvantage of individual areas. Discussions have taken place and are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht, which has lead responsibility for the islands, in response to issues raised regarding the continuation of funding for the development offices on a number of non-Gaeltacht Islands. This reflected the fact that the issues involved are broader than just those relating to SICAP, which I acknowledge. I can assure the Deputy that both Departments fully understand the importance of the community development infrastructure on these islands. I and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, who I discussed this with as late as this morning, will be ensuring that both our Departments continue to collaborate to agree a workable solution into the future. In the meantime, LCDP funding for the groups concerned will continue until the end of March, as the Deputy is aware.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I thank the Minister for his reply which was full of generalities about which I did not particularly ask. When I received such an answer when I was a Minister, I tended to say, "That is not what the Deputy asked. Will you just give the answer to the question?" The answer to the question is that the Minister is able to assure me that funding for the development companies on the island will continue after March and will be approximately the same amount or perhaps a little more because inflation obviously takes its toll. That is the question to which they want an answer because the lives of those on the islands are at stake. Not only that, people have commitments and want to know what is going to happen. They are not particularly interested in the machinations between Departments because they say the Government acts as a collective and they are asking it to give them a collective answer. Will there be funding or not?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	I intend to see through broad Government funding mechanisms and ensure there will be adequate funding available for the islands. I do not think it would be appropriate to get into a specific identifiable figure for the following reason. A tendering process is ongoing which, legally, needs to be seen through. Having said that, as part of the process, I have indicated to the Deputy that the two Departments which have some responsibility - my Department and the Department run by my colleague, Deputy Humphreys - are collaborating and discussions are ongoing to ensure services for the islands will be maintained because of the valuable work done.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	I am a little confused. The Minister mentioned the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht as being the lead Department.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	Yes.

I thought the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, was in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	The Deputy has the wrong Humphreys. I meant to say the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys. Hers is the lead Department. It is a matter for the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Joe McHugh.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	There could be a role for the Department of Social Protection which gives the money. If one looks at the tendering process for SICAP, one will see that there is no provision under it to make this allocation to the development companies on the islands. Will the Minister confirm that this is a correct reading of the tendering process? Therefore, it will have to be a special allocation. Will the Minister confirm that regardless of whether it is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Minister of State at that Department or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, there will be a sum for the island development companies, give or take €500,000 or €600,000, to continue the vital work being done to ensure the sustainability of the islands, because without the development companies they are not sustainable?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	I have been clear about this. A process is under way. As a former Minister, the Deputy has been in this role. I understand what he is saying about the group of islands, but some are involved in the tendering process. One must respect this. I have to respect it, regardless of whether the Deputy does. There is a time period for dealing with concerns expressed, a process in which the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is involved. When we see the results of that process, we will collectively ensure there will be an adequate amount of funding for the islands. I am very confident and intend to ensure that will be the case.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	My question pertains to the cost of the water metering programme. A couple of weeks ago we learned that the estimated cost had jumped by €100 in the space of eight weeks in 2013. The final cost is €539 million. I recall figures of €320 million and €350 million being mentioned on the Government benches over the past two years. How did we arrive at a cost of €539 million?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord Gáis Éireann Group, now Ervia, and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the water metering programme. Following a tender process, the final cost of the metering programme was determined at €539 million. The cost reflects the outcome of the procurement process, taking account of the overall logistics of a programme of this scale and complexity. The initial estimates of the cost of the domestic metering programme were based largely on the experience of the non-domestic metering programme, the group water sector and market soundings, as there was no precedent for a programme of this scale over a very short duration. We were not necessarily comparing apples with apples and oranges with oranges. The estimate was based on much smaller-scale projects than the national domestic metering programme and was not a definitive budget. As with all capital projects, estimates are refined as the detailed technical scoping of the project evolves, including matters such as appropriate risk allocation and programme management, and ultimately it is the competitive process that determines the price, and rightly so. The final budget figure reflects the outcome of the detailed scoping of the project and the procurement process.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	The estimated cost of installing meters has increased by 20%. That represents a huge proportion of the taxpayers' and public moneys that have been soaked up thus far by Irish Water for the metering programme. I must assume that the consultants who came up with this estimate were the same people who were paid €85 million last year. There is considerable anger about that. Surely it would have been far better had some of this money been used to address real problems of water conservation and reducing water usage. In May 2013, the consultants estimated the cost at €431 million, but by the time the contracts were awarded in June, the figure was €539 million. Meanwhile, a survey carried out by local authorities, which would have been more accurate, came up with a figure of €539 million. Does the Minister not find it unusual that the figure determined through the local authorities' survey happened to correspond with the estimated cost of the contracts for installing meters arrived at six months previously?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	The question of whether it was unusual was never put to me. I have no reason to disbelieve people. We need to be clear that the procurement estimate of €431 million was based on the best information available at the time. The Deputy is aware that this estimate was based on data relating to non-domestic usage. It was also based on group water data. It is not entirely accurate to suggest there was a big jump from €431 million to €539 million in a short period. While that figure was cited a number of times in the months prior to completion of the tendering process, it was the last estimate available. That does not mean it was the last estimate available a few months previously. It was an estimate that had been in circulation for some time. The period of time for a jump of that nature is not exactly accurate. We must also remember that a tendering process was ongoing.Obviously within that time period if there was new data or a re-analysis of the actual cost, it was not something that would be made public in the middle of a tendering process.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	There are two very unusual facts here. First, we went from talking about €340 million a few years ago, and as recently as a year ago in this House, to talking about €539 million this year. It is also more than unusual that the final figure for the estimate by the local authority at €539 million just happens to be the same figure as that awarded for the contracts in the previous summer. That is highly unusual. If the Minister does not consider it unusual, the public and I do. The cost of the metering programme has soared from in excess of €300 million to €349 million. Will it even stop at that? Surely it is time for Irish Water to be scrapped. It is time for the Minister to cut his losses and abandon the metering programme. Indeed, in keeping with the Minister's own rules, is it not time to make that body accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General and to this House, which it is not at present?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	In regard to the Deputy's last comment, everybody is accountable across the suite of groups the Deputy mentioned, so it is a matter for the groups themselves. Irish Water is necessary, as I have made clear. Without it we simply will not have a water supply to the scale required in this city ten years hence, when people such as the Deputy and others will be roaring and shouting about why we do not have the water we need and why the Minister with responsibility for the environment, be it me, my predecessor or my successor, did not do something about it. Most reasonable people know we must deal with this issue from the investment point of view. If the investment is not made, there will be problems all over the country, including in the Deputy's county, my county and everywhere else.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	We have loads of water.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	I have been quite clear about the procurement process. The estimate was based on non-domestic information and on group scheme data. At the time it was an estimate. It was a long time before the tendering process, and once the tendering process was under way it would not have been appropriate for other data to be put in the public domain, considering a number of tenderers would have been completing the details of what they were pitching and so forth. It is clear that the figure which emerged from the tendering process is the figure that is required.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	If people are housed through private landlords under the new housing assistance payment, HAP, will they be automatically removed from the housing waiting list? Will they have to apply to get on the transfer list, rather than it being automatic? If that is the case, does that represent a false equation of the HAP with people's housing needs being met, for example, through the provision of social housing?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	The implementation of the housing assistance payment, HAP, is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the social housing strategy 2020, which I launched last week. Whatever one's opinion, I hope Deputies will see it as a step in the right direction, given the scale of investment that has been secured. The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities. The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income. Under section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, as amended, HAP is deemed to be a social housing support and, consequently, households in receipt of HAP are not entitled to remain on the local authority waiting list for social housing support. However, HAP recipients may access other social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list. HAP has been rolled out in seven local authority areas on a pilot basis.As an immediate step, I have issued a statutory direction to the seven authorities involved, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefitting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they so wish, through the transfer option. I have also directed that HAP recipients who apply to go on the transfer list should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list. In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP. Before the full roll-out of HAP, my Department will undertake a review of the transfer option with the seven pilot authorities, and this will begin soon. This will inform the overall review of the housing allocation system, which is a key action under the social housing strategy. Once the review is complete, I will make the necessary regulations to ensure the transfer option for HAP recipients operates consistently and effectively as part of the national roll-out of the new scheme.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I thank the Minister for the answer. Although he said recipients would have no less favourable terms than they would have had under the old housing waiting list, by definition, those on the transfer list have less favourable terms. Whereas previously, for every person taken off the housing waiting list one person was taken off the transfer list, now for every two people taken off the housing waiting list one is taken from the transfer list. By definition, they will lose out. It seems to be part of the privatisation of the responsibility for providing social housing, saying people's housing needs are met when they are in private rented accommodation. While I welcome the fact that people will be able to work while in receipt of HAP payments, there is no indication of how greater regulation will work. There is no increase of the limits on rent and no indication of how illegal top-ups, which half of those who receive rent supplement engage in, will be dealt with. There is no indication that HAP will deal with the problems.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	I thank the Deputy. As the Minister with responsibility, I am monitoring the areas where HAP is being rolled out and I am satisfied that it is working well. The feedback from local authorities is very good. I am glad the Deputy welcomed the fact that allowing people to work while having their housing needs met is a move in the right direction. We are clearly seeing that people are satisfied with it. My predecessor, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, made commitments that anybody who was in receipt of this would be able to avail of the other social housing supports. They were offered the choice, and, by and large, the majority of them are opting to do so. We are happy with the way it is working. The policies we have adopted over the recent years are not a continuation in any way, shape or form of a privatisation of social housing. I have been completely opposed to it, and the strategy announced last week aims to reverse the cycle.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	We have the institutionalisation of the long-term provision of social housing through rented accommodation. Instead of the State building the homes that people need and renting them to people, it is giving a massive yearly subsidy - at least €500 million - to private landlords. Half of all the income of private landlords comes from the State, with the top 20 earning almost €5 million. This has been the policy of previous Governments and it is being continued. At the heart of the social housing 2020 strategy are the HAP scheme, public-private partnerships with developers, and outsourcing of social housing to NGOs and approved housing bodies - almost everything but the investment of significant amounts of money to create homes for people.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I am perplexed by the Deputy's analysis. The social housing strategy represents the launch of the largest programme of housing investment in the history of the State, one of the largest programmes of house building by any Government. The Deputy's concerns about the outsourcing of the approved housing bodies, AHBs, worries me.The approved housing bodies, AHBs, have made a huge contribution in terms of social housing requirements and, in fairness, a number of people across the House have acknowledged that. I know they would not concur with the Deputy's statements. Through the programme I announced last week we are having to bring about a range of measures to ensure that people's housing needs are met by way of the housing assistance payment, HAP, which will be brought out across the country, but also in the long term through the construction programme I announced as part of that to deal with the core issue, which is supply. We do need more houses that are owned by the State and in the plan I announced, given the capital available to do so, and I got all the capital that was possible in terms of a Minister in my position, it is a huge plus for the future that we will have the level of local authority and social housing units built to meet that supply.

This is an emerging situation affecting hundreds of homes in the county. What does he plan to do to assist them because these home owners very much need the assistance of the Government?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which I have to admit was first raised with me by Councillor Martin Farren, and subsequently by a number of people. While I fully appreciate and acknowledge the difficult and distressing situations that householders have to deal with when faced with the consequences of the use of defective materials or poor workmanship in homes, building defects are, in general, matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, that is, the owner, the builder, the manufacturer, the supplier, the quarry owner and-or their respective insurers. In addition and where appropriate, affected home owners should pursue their structural guarantee insurance providers where a structural guarantee insurance is in place. In the event that the contracting parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the courts can be considered. My understanding is that legal proceedings are under way and have been instigated in some of the cases relating to the problems in Donegal, which is the appropriate course of action to take in the event that the responsible parties do not face up to their responsibilities and provide a solution to the affected home owners for whom I have a huge degree of sympathy. Notwithstanding that, my Department is prepared to review any information that can be made available in these matters, for example, test-laboratory reports on the concrete blocks, structural reports on the affected dwellings etc., and there is a range of other issues also. Having regard to such information, it may be in a position to offer advice which may be of assistance to affected home owners in seeking a resolution to their difficulties. In that regard, a meeting has been arranged between my Department and a delegation of affected home owners. In fact, it actually happened yesterday.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	The meeting took place yesterday but-----

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I was not available yesterday. I had a few more things going on but I have no issue with meeting them.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	I ask the Minister to meet them. This is an emerging issue mainly affecting homes built in the late 1990s and up to the mid-2000s. The number of those affected is growing. It is estimated that hundreds, and probably up to 1,000 or more, homes in County Donegal are affected by it. I note that the Minister is offering sympathy and advice to these home owners but what they need is help from the Department and from himself. To get homes tested to establish the exact problem in each of homes costs thousands of euro which these families simply do not have. Without the Minister getting involved to assist them, they will not be able to deal with the problem and will be left in limbo. I know with respect to the pyrite issue in Dublin that after a long period a resolution board and a panel was set up to get to the bottom of the problem. The Minister needs to explore the situation and establish a similar set-up here, but I ask that he meet with representatives of the home owners and progress that development.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	After this issue was first brought to my attention by Councillor Martin Farren, a further investigation took place. It is not about pyrite but mica, which is unique territory. We need to see the analysis and where we can go. My Department will be helpful and progress the matter to obtain some satisfaction for the people who should never have been put in this place by shabby and disgraceful practices. This shows why we need real building control regulations for the future. My Department met them yesterday and had a comprehensive discussion with them. I have not been made privy to the details, although I had a discussion with some people. Once the information has been bought through the system, I will have no problem meeting the representatives, possibly in Donegal if I am there. We will try to monitor the position and make progress because it is an issue.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	I emphasise the importance of a quick response from the Minister on this point. A small number of homeowners have carried out tests and identified the presence of Muscovite mica as the problem. Some have had to take remedial action by removing and replacing outside walls. After investigation, others identified outer and inner walls as being affected. The houses date from the late 1990s and early 2000s, which means that it is primarily young families and families with young children who are involved. They do not have the finances to come up with the thousands of euro required to carry out tests. This is where they need the assistance of the Minister who should come on board by establishing a panel with the expertise to engage with each household identified as having a problem and report to the Minister on the extent of the problem in order that solutions can be delivered quickly to assist the families affected, many of whom do not have time on their hands. It is a living nightmare.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	The point is well made. A number of people of all political persuasions have contacted me about the issue. There is good will in the Department. Yesterday there was a meeting, but I have not yet had a chance to go through the information provided. My officials will brief me on the issue and we will offer to help, but we must first have the analysis to see what is the current position, the scale of the problem, the individuals involved, the structures affected, the safety consequences and other issues that need analysis. Subsequently, we will examine the best and most prudent direction to take to help them from the Government side and ensure those who did this are dealt with. I have seen some of the photographs of the area. These practices which were prevalent in a number of areas are completely unacceptable and the people who ensured young families would be left in this manner must be followed to the end.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	I ask the Minister for his views on the reported memo from his Department to local authorities raising the idea of increasing rent for council tenants who do not pay water charges and the threat of eviction.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	Since 1 January Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. The occupier of a property is liable to pay the water charges bill and legislation provides that the owner is the occupier unless the contrary is proved. Irish Water is providing landlords with the opportunity to prove that they are not the occupiers by providing tenants’ names. This will allow Irish Water to contact tenants to complete the registration and bill them thereafter.The tenant will have to register with Irish Water to avail of the water conservation grant or to get lower charges than the default capped charge, €260, where they are single adult occupants or their metered usage is less than the maximum charge. Draft legislation which I will bring forward will place certain obligations on landlords where the tenant has not paid charges. In the case of local authority tenants where deposit arrangements do not apply, a customer is in arrears for more than 12 months and a late payment fee has accrued, Irish Water, having first provided the customer with the opportunity to pay the arrears or enter into a payment plan, will advise the local authority concerned of the amount of the arrears. It is envisaged that the legislation would provide for the local authority to recover the amount outstanding over a 12-month period and to remit the amount involved to Irish Water. These scenarios can be avoided by entering into a payment plan with Irish Water, which I encourage everyone to do. Various easy-pay options will be made available through post offices or other payment providers. The overall net cost for those who register is either €1.15 per week for a single adult household or €3 per week for all others. Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstances, as I have made quite clear already publicly. My Department will be consulting with the local government sector, social housing providers and landlord and tenant representatives in the course of drafting the necessary legislation to give effect to the measures proposed.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	That is outrageous discrimination against local authority tenants. The Minister stated that they could have money stolen from them to pay a tax they do not want to pay, a tax that they are boycotting, together, potentially, with the majority of the population. The Minister has stated, however, that councils should increase their rent to take the money for this charge off them. Will he comment on the threat of eviction? If local authority tenants do not pay the increased rent that will potentially be imposed on them as a result of these water charges, will they be evicted? Will people be thrown out of their homes for refusing to pay water charges? How do the councils feel about being made into debt collectors for Irish Water? It is clear the Minister has problems with private landlords who do not want to be made into debt collectors. How come measures dealing with these points are not included in the water Bill to come before the House this week? Is it because he is rightly concerned about the reaction it will provoke? If people knew local authority tenants could face eviction for not paying water charges, tens of thousands of people, even more, would flood the streets on 10 December in opposition to this draconian scaremongering measure.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	The legislation on this will be before the Houses this week and also early in the new year. Deputy Paul Murphy will obviously have his chance to debate all of this in some detail. If people enter into a reasonable payment plan, they will avoid all of the issues in question. I do not envisage anyone being thrown out of a local authority house in any way. I am in charge of local authorities and I know the main reason local authority tenants are evicted is anti-social behaviour. I do not envisage any other scenario where eviction would be the course of action. The Deputy claims local authority tenants are being discriminated against. I do not agree with him. It is only fair that everyone pays their way as regards the contribution to what is necessary for water infrastructure. Hundreds of thousands of people - some of whom are watching these proceedings - already pay for water and have done so for many decades. I do not see Deputy Paul Murphy protesting outside their water schemes, yet they have had to pay thousands of euro over the past number of decades for water. There are two ways of looking at this.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	I am happy to explain how this constitutes discrimination. Those who own their own homes will not have money taken off them. Those renting privately may have it taken from their deposit, but that remains to be seen. However, the Minister has stated that council tenants will have their rents increased to take unpaid water charges from them. That amounts to discrimination against those who are council tenants. Again, will the Minister give a commitment that nobody will be evicted for refusing to pay their water charges? The suggestion that people could be evicted was well reported in the media over the past week or so. Either it is a scare story coming from the Government or some similar source, designed to encourage people to pay and not join the boycott, or there is a basis of truth to it. If the Minister could confirm absolutely that nobody will be evicted for not paying their water charges, it would be helpful and assuage people’s fears.Finally, the threats will not work, the baby carrot will not work and water charges will be defeated.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	I thank the Deputy for his consistency, if nothing else. I have said this before and I will say it again: I do not envisage any person being evicted due to water charges and Irish Water.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	Is that a commitment?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	I am in charge of local authorities and when people are evicted it is usually for anti-social behaviour, although evictions are rare. Sometimes neighbours cannot live with the anti-social behaviour of others and evictions ensue, but I do not envisage evictions connected to water charges. The way for people to deal with problems with water charges is through a payment plan, and various mechanisms will allow for this. An Post will be a key component in payment plans in rural areas, but there will be other options and I expect that many people will avail of them.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	The serious public health risk posed by exposure to high levels of radon gas in some houses around the country is well known. Radon gas is linked with 250 cases of lung cancer per year in Ireland, and the message of the national radon control strategy is to build awareness and get people to address the issue. In order to assist with the objectives and implementation of the national radon control strategy, I urge the Minister to introduce a grant scheme to assist with the cost of remediation works, which come to around €800 per house, and possibly with the cost of the test.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I thank the Deputy for her important question. The national radon control strategy, which was published on 17 February 2014, was developed by an inter-agency group and sets out some 48 recommendations under six thematic areas. The ultimate aim is to reduce the number of radon-related lung cancer cases. While it is envisaged that the recommendations set out in the strategy will be addressed over a four-year period, it is also recognised that the full impact of the strategy may not be fully realised within this period, as many of the measures implemented will continue to reduce the radon risk in subsequent years. Successful implementation of the national radon control strategy will require action from a range of Government Departments, public bodies and other stakeholders. It will require the clear identification of responsibilities, good co-ordination between the various stakeholders and effective monitoring of progress. Accordingly, a national radon control strategy co-ordination group has been established to implement and track the key recommendations in the strategy. Led by my Department, it comprises representatives from key Departments and agencies. This group will, inter alia, co-ordinate policies and actions on radon across the relevant Departments and agencies, monitor implementation of the strategy, report annually on progress and, at the end of the four-year period covered by the action plan, make recommendations to the Government on what further actions it considers necessary at that time. While there are no explicit plans at present to establish a scheme of grant assistance for radon testing or remediation, the national radon control strategy, NRCS, co-ordination group is looking at a wide range of initiatives that seek to better integrate consideration of radon issues into other processes and actions. These include the use of information to be provided in property transactions to drive awareness and promote remedial actions, and also the installation of passive preventative measures in new buildings.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	I thank the Minister. I am concerned that although radon has been spoken of for some years, having talked to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and others involved in radiological protection, I have concluded there has been little effect on the general public. This is evidenced by the number of radon tests on houses. The map attached to the national radon control strategy shows certain areas with seriously high levels of radon. I believe part of the problem is that people feel a naturally occurring gas cannot be all that bad. The problem is that radon gets captured and cannot escape, thus causing a serious health risk. I live in Ballina, which has been identified as having a serious radon issue.The level of radon gas was measured as the equivalent of 27 chest X-rays per day for the individuals living in the house in question, which is very serious. We need to consider giving grants in order that people can assist themselves.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which, to be honest, is concerning. As I outlined, a programme of work is under way. I have asked my officials to assess the matter and, through the analysis being carried out, ascertain whether a higher level of concern is warranted than when the process started. That would mean that we might need quicker intervention measures. I will return to the Deputy on the matter, but I am not completely ruling out what she is suggesting at some level in the future. It may be possible to scale something in over a period of several years. The Deputy is right about areas in which there are high radon levels. There are areas in most counties where radon levels are a concern, particularly in some parts of the south east, the west, the south west and the north west. In some areas more than 10% of houses may have radon levels above the reference level. The map is disturbing when analysed in detail. This is my commitment. A group is in place and undertaking work as part of the four year programme. We will look into the matter to determine whether, through the group's analysis, the concern level has heightened to a point where we might need to deal with matter in a more direct and interventionist way.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	I would welcome an assessment of the information campaign undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency. Last week an information campaign was run in County Mayo and several public meetings were held. By no means were the numbers who turned out overwhelming, notwithstanding the radio campaign and so on. People are concerned that this will open a can of worms. They are concerned that they will find out that there are excessive levels of radon in their houses and that they will have to undertake remediation works. Many of them would be unable to afford to pay €800 for this work. We could simply focus on areas that have been identified as high risk where there is uranium in the undersoil and soil conditions are such a person should examine his or her house to establish whether he or she is in danger or at risk from high levels of radon gas. We should support people and any support provided should be meaningful. When they find out that they have a problem, they should be assured that there will be some assistance towards the cost of fixing the problem.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	The Deputy has raised a good question. The work of the EPA is ongoing. The public awareness campaign has been moderately successful. On the map to which I referred certain areas have been identified as having higher than normal levels or spikes. That is where the EPA has concentrated its campaign. Having said that, there is a necessity to intensify the campaign to create an organic awareness of this issue. People are aware that there is an issue, but it needs to get more into the mainstream of their consciousness. I have asked officials to consider ways in which we can ensure the EPA, working through my Department, will be able to do this.

They have sought access to the rational allocation model from the Minister. Furthermore, they would welcome an opportunity to discuss their concerns about the cuts with him since they are causing much stress and distress.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. She has spoken about it previously and I accept that it is a source of concern.  Within the constraints of the prevailing budgetary situation I have been particularly mindful of the need to prioritise funding for the local and community development programme, until March 2015, and its successor, the social inclusion and community activation programme, from April 2015. It was necessary to do this and it is welcome that I have done so. My aim is to ensure resources are allocated in the fairest way possible and make the maximum contribution to tackling disadvantage, job creation and economic recovery. The intention of my Department is over time to use the available knowledge of population levels and disadvantage to ensure available resources are targeted at areas of greatest need. As a tool to assist in this process, the resource allocation model, RAM, which will be made available has been developed. It allows relative disadvantage to be measured throughout all census areas. To achieve the objective of moving towards allocating resources according to this model, in recent years my Department has worked to ensure funding is protected for those areas with greatest need according to the RAM. This principle was used to decide on funding allocations for the social inclusion and community activation programme and I am satisfied that the funding allocated to Dublin's inner city under SICAP is a fair allocation of resources using the model. The funding reduction referred to should be considered in the context of several specific factors which applied to the Dublin inner city funding arrangements under the current programme. In particular, the community development programme funding model was not based on population and deprivation levels, as proposed for SICAP, instead providing funding for two staff, on average, and overheads in each project. In addition, the fact that there was no local development company in the inner city gave rise to a higher number of separate structures and associated costs relative to other areas, creating scope for efficiency savings to be made in the new arrangements under SICAP. Notwithstanding this and since it is a matter of concern, my Department will be liaising with Dublin City Council and other appropriate stakeholders to find a workable solution in terms of transitional arrangements that may be required in the specific circumstances arising in the inner city. In the meantime, local and community development programme funding for the groups concerned will continue until the end of March 2015.

It is important that the Minister meet the groups in question and listen to their concerns. The statistics are available. This area has the highest number of unemployed persons, as well as the highest number of lone parents. I am unsure whether the allocation model to which the Minister referred is getting to the core of all of the issues involved. I will outline one story. I attended a project graduation ceremony recently. Certificates were given to those who had undergone training and some of the graduates were not able to attend. Why? The reason was they were in work. That shows how these projects in communities are working. I am keen for the Minister to take the opportunity, if only for a short period, to hear about the work being done because sometimes these organisations and individuals are lost in the percentages and models to which the Minister referred. Is the Minister prepared to meet them?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I have already confirmed to the House that I am prepared to meet them. There is no issue in that regard; it is a question of agreeing a time. That is my commitment. The process must be gone through. It has begun and it is necessary to undertake it as part of the tendering process. It needs to be executed. I am determined to ensure a fair solution to the issues involved which have been raised by several Deputies will be found, either through the SICAP model or whatever necessary measures need to be taken in parallel with the process. It is not possible to go into the detail of the matter now, but I assure the Deputy that I will be keeping a close eye on it to ensure a fair distribution.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	I wish to raise again with the Taoiseach the absolute urgent need for an emergency intervention by the Government to deal with the homelessness issue in the country, particularly in the capital city, Dublin.Will he deal with the fact that last evening, bearing in mind that it is winter, there were approximately 168 adults on the streets, while approximately 800 children were in emergency accommodation, including hotel rooms across the country? In the most recent days, the very sad death of Jonathan Corrie occurred ten feet from the steps of Leinster House itself. That illustrated starkly the absolute sense of emergency and urgency around the homelessness issue right now in 2014. It is a problem that has escalated dramatically over the last 12 months, according to Focus Ireland and the Simon Community. I asked the Taoiseach last week about the cap on rent allowance. I raised the issue of its inadequacy and prior to that outlined the very well researched article by Kitty Holland in The Irish Times, which detailed the appalling situation facing families and children. The Taoiseach will also have read her article about Shane and Ciara Dwyer, which clearly illustrated the dilemma. This married couple had been sleeping rough in their car for over three weeks prior to the publication of the article. Their rent had increased by 50%. As a couple, they were entitled to €540 rent allowance per month and were allowed to pay rent capped at €750 per month. The estate agent told them they had to sign a lease for €1,050, with the result that they had to hand back the keys and go. That is just one illustration from west Tallaght, but it is a national issue. Deputies are meeting couples and single parents who are saying they cannot rent above the cap and must live in dingy, damp accommodation rather than elsewhere at a different price threshold. It is something the Government has not responded to. Targets for 2018 or 2020 are meaningless to children and families in a serious plight. The Simon Community said it was extremely disappointed in the Government's failure in the budget for 2015 to address rent supplement levels. The Taoiseach still has a chance to do so. Focus Ireland, the Simon Community and the various other groups involved are saying that changing the rent supplement framework and increasing the rent caps are required as an immediate, urgent intervention. That would have a very significant impact in alleviating the pressures on families who are homeless and who are about to be made homeless as a result of the Government's inaction.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	I thank Deputy Martin for raising the issue of homelessness. It is not the first time it has been raised here. It is most distressing to find that a man died on the street over the last few days. Everyone agrees that this is an issue that is not new but that has been exacerbated in the last number of years in particular. It is also fair to say that the extent of moneys being provided for the NGOs is significant, to put it mildly, and what is needed now is follow-through to ensure that there is an effective response for those who are homeless. As Deputy Martin is well aware, these are in different categories. There are those who are on the streets, there are those who are in bed and breakfast accommodation and there are those who are in hotels, particularly with children, which is not an ideal situation by any means. In regard to rough sleeping on the streets of Dublin, where the count has shown an increase in numbers, it is not actually a question of the allocation of money. For instance, arrangements are now in place to expand the number of emergency bed spaces. A total of 164 beds are being sourced by Dublin City Council, of which 38 are already in place. There will be another 30 places by 8 December, which is later this week, another 76 by 15 December and a further 20 by 5 January. At the last count, there were 160 people sleeping rough in Dublin. There are 665 vacant units in the hands of Dublin City Council which are being refurbished and returned to use. Work has started on 245 of those and work on a further 410 will commence in the next four to six months. The Housing First service for rough sleepers is under way in Dublin. The programme is run by Focus Ireland and the Fr. McVerry Trust to support rough sleepers to find and sustain tenancies. There is also the matter of housing allocations, on which the Minister has written to everybody, and the tenancy sustainment protocol. An additional €10.5 million was made available in this regard for homeless people. The Minister is calling a meeting on Thursday to talk to NGOs and meet with the Archbishop of Dublin and the Lord Mayor. The matter has been on the agenda of the Cabinet sub-committee on homelessness and social policy for the last number of weeks. That will be dealt with next Monday. I hope that, arising from the meetings that the Minister will have with the Lord Mayor, the archbishop, the chairpersons of local authorities and representatives of NGOs, we can reflect on the best impact and effect that can be obtained from the considerable moneys being spent through the NGOs to ensure that rough sleepers can be given a roof over their heads and a place to stay in the first instance. From speaking to people, it is clear that some of these cases are so complex that it is very difficult to say one could get all the people off the streets. Some of them have particular problems. I found it distressing to hear about the man who lost his life in Molesworth Street. I recall, as the Ceann Comhairle will, the good lady who used to sleep over there in a box in the mid-1970s. Despite the efforts of all the agencies at the time, it was very difficult to get her to agree to stay in a hostel or any other place. I genuinely believe, given the number of vacant rooms and spaces, that if we can get everybody focused on a single objective, the number of rough sleepers in the city will be very limited and those will be the very complex cases. In respect of the other issues of homelessness, where people are in bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels, the Minister has dealt with these matters at considerable length. Clearly, the allocation over the next number of years of €2.2 billion for social and affordable housing is the way to go. No matter what one does, one has to build those houses. That means planning permissions, income streams for contractors and getting the blocks and houses in place. Deputy Martin should believe me that it is not the intention of Government to see anybody homeless.

It is equally incredible that, prior to launching a €3 billion strategy, the Minister did not meet with Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, Fr. Peter McVerry and others to discuss the specific issue of homelessness. That is a disgrace. It should not take the death of someone close to Leinster House to necessitate such a meeting, or a call by the archbishop for such a summit for the Minister to hold one. It is striking that the Taoiseach's most significant policy initiative, if we are to believe everything we read in the media, was his statement on Friday evening that he was going to reduce the top rate of tax and look after the very wealthy. That is his number one policy priority, not the 800 children in hotel rooms and apartments. Members can nod their heads all they like, but that is the bottom line.

That body says it is extremely disappointed by the failure of the Government to address rent supplement levels in budget 2015. It stated:Rent supplement levels must be increased across the country as a matter of urgency. They are too low when compared to market rents ...Is the Taoiseach listening? I ask Deputy Varadkar to listen also.[T]his is causing homelessness and preventing people from leaving homelessness.I am not saying this; the people on the frontier are. What the Government did to rent supplement caused and accelerated the crisis in terms of families having to be put up in emergency accommodation in hotels, rooms and apartments and going out to the airport to heat themselves. The Government took its eye off the ball on this. There was no urgency or sense of emergency. Other things have mattered to the Government in terms of politicking, electoral issues and all that kind of stuff, but this is a crisis that everyone wants resolved.

I will put it a final time. Will the Government change the rent supplement and rent cap levels? The market has changed dramatically and the Government has simply not responded to the marketplace. People are being left homeless as a result. Focus Ireland indicated that it had to deal with 45 families in October compared to eight families in the same month last year. The position has worsened dramatically. While I accept that changing the rent supplement regime is not the only solution, such a change would have an immediate impact.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	146	People were shocked by the death yesterday of Jonathan Corrie in a doorway less than 50 yards from this House. Our thoughts are with Mr. Corrie's family and loved ones. The Taoiseach stated he was distressed to hear of Mr. Corrie's death and I am sure that is true. However, I and others have been raising for ages the Government's failure to tackle the housing crisis. He should not be surprised, therefore, that in this day and age a man can die on the streets of our capital city just yards from this Parliament because he did not have a home. The Taoiseach stated there are complex issues involved. The fact is the State failed Mr. Corrie. I listened this morning to a woman called Sophie Pigot speaking on "Today with Sean O'Rourke". Ms Pigot, whom I do not know, struck me as being very caring and modest. Speaking of how she tried to get Mr. Corrie help, she said, "We are a small society. He could have been my second cousin." That is the truth of the matter. Under the Taoiseach's watch, however, anyone could become homeless.  This morning, I visited the spot where Mr. Corrie died to pay my respects. There were bouquets of flowers, some with notes attached. One note read:Jonathan RIP. I feel privileged to have known you. You were an absolute gentleman and a pleasure to chat to. I'll miss seeing you around and stopping for a chat.Another read:In loving memory of Jonathan Corrie RIP, who died bravely in the cold in a Dublin doorway. I feel ashamed that in a country full of spare houses and rooms, that we did not put a roof over your head. Now is the time for Government, NAMA, developers, Councils, the public, to take action as a national emergency.The number of people sleeping rough in Dublin surged by 20% this year. This Christmas, 168 people are expected to sleep on the streets, which is three times the figure recorded when records began in 2007. Some 30 people are sleeping rough in my constituency and 800 children across the State are housed in temporary emergency accommodation. Will the Taoiseach facilitate an emergency Dáil debate on the escalating and chronic homelessness crisis? Will he initiate an emergency intervention?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	147	As I stated to Deputy Martin, the Government has allocated €55.5 million of taxpayers' money towards dealing with homelessness. I also pointed out that time limits have been set for bringing into use rooms and vacant homes that are currently being repaired for homeless people. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government meets senior officials at 9 a.m. every Monday morning to discuss the progress being made on this issue. The issue is not only about the allocation of money - there is more money than ever - but about how one gets a response from that. My immediate concern is the people who have been sleeping in doorways around this city, some of whom I know, having spoken to them over the years. Some of them have complicated problems and do not want to stay in accommodation. The nature of their problems makes the issue very difficult. The Minister has called together the chairs of the local authorities, senior officials, the Lord Mayor of Dublin and Archbishop of Dublin and non-governmental organisations to ascertain the reasons we have not done things better and 160 rough sleepers were recorded in the latest count.  Once the meeting on Thursday has finished, the Cabinet sub-committee will deal with its outcome and make decisions at Monday's meeting. Perhaps we could have a debate in the House on this day week focusing on the outcome of these decisions and on how to get a better result and effect from moneys that are being provided to NGOs, which do very good work in very difficult circumstances. That is my immediate concern.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	149	In respect of the longer term homeless - those in bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation - the question of the rent supplement cap being changed would, according to the analysis of the Department of Social Protection, bring very little extra relief. As Deputy Adams is well aware, the answer is the provision of proper housing. This requires investment, which the Government has provided.It is now up to the local authorities to follow the process of having planning permission granted and the contractors on site. No matter what one does, one cannot deal with this effectively unless one provides adequate numbers of houses and apartments for people to live in. That is the answer.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	151	The Deputy is well aware that during the so-called good years 90,000 houses were built when we needed 25,000 or 30,000. Last year, only 9,000 houses were built in the country. Clearly, there is a ferocious demand for housing and accommodation in the Dublin area, and the answer is that we have to invest, build and provide for that. The Government has signed off on a three year programme for social and affordable housing totalling €2.2 billion, a figure higher than ever before. That is of no value until one sees the concrete and blocks on the ground and houses being provided. Therein lies the answer.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	152	I am taking the Taoiseach's answer as meaning that we will have an emergency debate next week. If that is the case, it is welcome, but it is very unfortunate that it comes after the Government has published its housing policy. That strategy is fatally flawed. It does not provide any response to the current homelessness crisis. It says nothing about the crucial issue of rent supplement caps or rent controls, despite the fact they are some of the factors driving families onto the streets. The figure of 35,000 in regard to social housing does not add up. The Taoiseach, inadvertently or not, gave an answer. He said we are not building enough proper houses, which is the answer. Whose fault and responsibility is that? We have seen emergency time provided here to cater for major bankers and the elites. The Government supports socialism for the rich but the poor people, those at the bottom of the ladder, are not being supported. The Taoiseach obviously hopes that the private sector will fill this gap. He acknowledged that for decades the State has not taken responsibility for social housing, but instead handed it over to the private sector.  It is ridiculous that he is meeting the people on the front line after, rather than before, he published his housing policy. Now that he has been converted to some degree to some of these issues, does he agree that local authorities and voluntary housing associations are best placed to deliver the homes that people need and that they need a level of direct State investment far above that indicated in the latest Government strategy? Will he commit to this in the upcoming period?  This is happening on the Taoiseach's watch. He cannot blame anybody for this issue. I tried to approach it positively and did not want to score points. There is a major emergency, which has been flagged week in and week out for the past couple of years in the Chamber. Will the Taoiseach now commit to recognising that there has to be direct State funding to give people who need social housing the homes they require?

The answer is already in the housing strategy published by the Government. The allocation made includes direct build costs for social and affordable housing for the first time in years.

The strategy includes direct provision and the involvement of voluntary housing organisations. That is where the answer lies. One can move things around in terms of rent supplement on the same number of vacancies available, but that does not answer the question in terms of rising demand.  We have to have investment, building and more houses and apartments. That is the central feature of the Government's housing strategy and we have made the decision to allocate sufficient money to do that. In respect of those who are in difficulty now, that tenancy sustainment protocol is in place with the Dublin authorities.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	162	The Taoiseach keeps telling us that the country has the fundamentals right. Is there anything more fundamental than having a roof over one's head? As has been said already, just yards from here a man, Mr. Jonathan Corrie, died on our streets. It was a needless and lonely death and it is just plain wrong.  This is combined with a situation whereby hundreds of children and their families are forced to exist in temporary accommodation. It is a fundamental statement of what the Taoiseach views as the priorities. He said hostel and temporary accommodation is not ideal, but it has become almost normal. There is nothing normal about families living in temporary hostel accommodation. All his pronouncements at home and abroad of how we have turned a corner never include any reference to the social consequences. That is where the Taoiseach seems to be thoroughly detached from the realities of many people's lives. On television last night I saw the Taoiseach spitting fire about the awful allegations of abuse in a County Mayo care home. He was livid. He described the situation in the care home as intolerable. I am still waiting for that sense of outrage from him in regard to homelessness and the families existing in temporary accommodation. Long-term damage is being done to children who are in stressful environments with their families.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	164	The Taoiseach cannot call an inquiry into this because the buck stops in one place, that is, with him. For every day there is inaction, the situation will worsen. The €55 million for homelessness to which the Taoiseach referred does not involve spending €55 million on what he spent it on two years ago. It has been spent throughout the country to try to assist functioning families whom one would never have seen in a homeless situation before. Rent assistance and caps do matter. Is the Taoiseach excluding them from the solution to this crisis? Will the forum on Thursday only consider the Dublin area? Will it discuss those who sleep rough or the wider issue of homelessness? 
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	The answer to the Deputy's first question is that it is not excluded. I have already pointed out that the analysis of the Department of Social Protection indicates that it is not the answer. It is in some cases, but if the cap is raised others who are next in line and who are deemed to be on the verge of homelessness will then get into difficulties. The sustainable temporary situation which applies to local authorities will continue. The meeting on Thursday is essentially about the situation in Dublin, which is the worst in the country. It does not mean that other areas are not the focus of attention. As the Deputy knows, it is not right to have families with children, in particular, staying in bed and breakfast accommodation or hotel rooms. The reason this is happening is that there is a demand for housing which does not exist. How will we provide housing except by investing to build? The social impact investing project, as it is called, increased the homelessness action team, dealing with families presenting as homeless and moving them on to other housing options as quickly as possible. Under that project, 136 homeless families, including 250 children, were moved out of emergency accommodation into suitable long-term accommodation. Focus Ireland has engaged directly with 100 of those 136 families and suitable alternative accommodation has been provided for them. Work is under way to maintain them in these new tenancies. The prevention campaign launched in June 2014 has assisted in raising awareness among families and others of their rights as tenants and of where to go for support. Also, the inter-tenant sustainability protocol, agreed between Dublin City Council, the Department of Social Protection, the other three Dublin local authorities and Threshold as part of this campaign, is working. This service is useful in supporting families at risk of losing tenancies in the private rented sector. The council reports that over 2,050 households contacted the service up to the end of October, of which over 850 households were assisted through practical interventions and a further 200 tenancies are protected as a result of those interventions. The interventions included increases to the rent supplement limits in order to ensure the tenants could remain in their private rented accommodation. Deputies are aware this protocol has been in place for some time. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, has issued an invitation to elected mayors and CEOs of voluntary organisations to meet him on Thursday. We hope to follow with an analysis of the outcome of that meeting on Monday and we can debate the issue in the House on Tuesday. We must invest in building suitable houses, apartments and other suitable accommodation -----

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	167	We cannot do that without the Government having made a decision.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	168	I have been raising this issue for the past 18 months or two years, much of the time with the Minister for Social Protection and specifically in regard to rent assistance and rent caps. Not a day goes by without people coming into my office to talk about their embarrassment at finding themselves in this situation. Most of these people are in functioning families. They talk about being in despair and their sense of disbelief because this was never a situation they thought they would find themselves in. They talk about stress and about being on medication to deal with it and about that stress transferring to their children. This has not just been happening in the past couple of weeks, but has been going on for the past couple of years. The issue has been well flagged. One thing homeless agencies advise is that we must try to prevent homelessness. They suggest this is where rent caps are important and that we must negotiate an extra three, six or nine months to keep people in their homes. Many of these homes are being sold because the banks are insisting on this. Others are being sold because people are getting out of negative equity. There is a time lag attached to this. The Taoiseach said this is not about money, but I believe it is and it compares badly with what is happening elsewhere. Last week, we heard on the news that €100 million extra was found to cover the under-estimate in the water metering programme which the consultants had got wrong. That money needs to be put into this area and into a homelessness prevention programme that will buy the extra time required until some of the houses being built come on stream in a few years time. This is critical. I urge the Taoiseach to ensure that is a feature of this initiative.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	In respect of the Deputy's comment, she is aware the difference between the estimate and the formal tender in regard to the water metering programme was very clear. Last May, the Government approved the implementation plan on the State's response to homelessness, which has set out the national strategy. This plan approved 80 particular practical decisions to deal with this issue and to deliver 2,700 units of accommodation before the end of 2016. The timescale for this is set out. Dublin City Council has amended its housing allocation scheme to give greater priority to the homeless and 25% will be allocated to homeless households in 2014. This allocation has been amended again recently and the number of homes allocated for the homeless has been increased from 222 to 310 in 2014. By the end of quarter 3 of this year, some 545 individuals had moved on from homelessness to independent living in the Dublin region. This is an improvement. Under the implementation plan, 900 units will be allocated annually for homeless households.

The money is there, the decision has been made and the strategy is laid out. However, there is no answer to the Deputy's question until blocks, concrete and accommodation are provided. No matter what one does, one can only deal with demand by meeting demand, which means building and investment.

In the meantime, we must ensure a better response, particularly for the homeless and people sleeping rough, for the coming winter and for the work the NGOs do in respect of this issue. I hope that arising from the death of the unfortunate man down the street this week's meeting will ensure a follow through so that we get the best possible result. I know from experience that it is exceptionally difficult to get some of those who are homeless to want to move to accommodation because of the nature of the problems they have.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	176	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together. As I have said previously, most recently in my statement to this House on 5 November after the October European Council, I warmly welcome the appointment of the new European Commission, which took office on 1 November. This is a critical time of institutional change and renewal for the European Union. President Juncker and the 27 other new Commissioners were formally appointed by the European Council on 24 October. Earlier that week, they had been approved in a plenary vote of the European Parliament.  Ireland enjoyed a strong relationship with the previous Commission, most particularly in our shared work of addressing the challenges of promoting job creation and economic growth at home and across Europe. Ministers have already begun meeting formally with the relevant new Commissioners, and I look forward to strengthening Ireland's relationship with the college of Commissioners during the legislative term ahead.  After the Government's nomination of former Deputy, Phil Hogan, to be a member of the Commission, I wrote to and spoke with President Juncker about his possible portfolio. I was delighted that the former Minister was nominated as Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, one of the most important commisionerships in Europe. This is not only testament to his considerable experience and abilities, but also recognition of Ireland’s sustained commitment to the EU, and follows on from our success during last year’s Presidency of the EU, including in securing agreement on the Common Agricultural Policy reform package. I was also pleased with the appointment of Federica Mogherini to the pivotal role of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and I look forward to working with her in her new capacity.  President Juncker has set out a clear agenda for the Commission for the next five years, focusing on jobs, growth and investment, on energy union and climate and on the digital single market. His agenda, and the Commission's work programme for 2015, both reflect the strategic agenda for the EU. That agenda was set out by the European Council in June this year. President Juncker has my full support and I am delighted he is President of the Commission. He is a very experienced and capable politician. He understands that the European Union must remain focused on jobs and growth and on delivering for our citizens. I look forward to working with him.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	178	In addition to the new Parliament and Commission, the new President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, the former Polish Prime Minister, took office yesterday. I believe President Tusk will provide excellent leadership for the Council. His appointment is recognition not only of his own wide experience and knowledge, but also of how far EU integration has progressed since 2004. Although I have not recently held formal meetings with President Tusk or with the High Representative, I have spoken with both of them at the recent European Council meetings which I and they attended. I also wrote to Mr. Tusk at the time of his appointment to congratulate him and reiterate our commitment to a strong working relationship. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has also written to Ms Mogherini in similar terms and he met her in her new capacity at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 17 November.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	179	While welcoming the appointment of an Irish Commissioner to this EU agriculture post, I have to say I continue to have grave concerns about many of the actions of Commissioner Hogan when he was a Government Minister here. I am also highly critical of the method of selection of Commissioners. Right across the EU, citizens want a social Union, but the Commission and the way the Commissioners are selected does not reflect that. The Taoiseach may want to comment on some of the decisions taken here when Commissioner Hogan was in office, particularly the delivery of Leader programme and the role he played in dismantling the local development sector. The European Commission sent the Government a list of 266 questions - or over 400, depending on what piece of documentation one reads - in regard to the Government's proposed changes to the delivery of the Leader programme. In my opinion, these are attempts to redefine this programme, which was essentially a genuine grassroots, community-based measure, as a programme that is completely subject to whatever local authority or Government happens to be in power. Given the threat to the local development sector and the concerns raised by many about the impact on local rural communities, and given the European Commission's questions to the Government on its programme for rural development for 2014 to 2020, will the Government review its proposed new measures? I want to make a brief comment on the appointment of Ms Mogherini as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. We might get a chance later to return to this issue, but I want to ask the Taoiseach one simple question. At the beginning of November, Ms Mogherini said: "I would be happy if by the end of my term, a Palestinian state existed". On a visit to Gaza last week, she said: “We need a Palestinian state - that is the ultimate goal and this is the position of all the European Union”. Does the Taoiseach agree with this objective? Will the Government make it very clear if it does agree, given that in the past it has said it has to keep pace with Europe, almost as if we did not have an independent foreign policy mandate? Now that the European Union has put its flag firmly to that mast, will the Taoiseach declare that the Government is also for a Palestinian state?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	180	We have supported a two-state solution in respect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for many years. That means support for Palestine. It was always part of the principle that there would be a comprehensive response to this from a European perspective. This has been very difficult to achieve, however, despite the fact that interventions from both Europe and the United States over many years were in some cases on the brink of achieving agreement, and it never actually worked out in the way people would have expected. I note Sweden's comment and I note the comment from France in the last period. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is reflecting on the best way to go forward. There is a question of whether it is feasible to have a comprehensive response to Europe's principle of a two-state solution, as defined for many years, and whether that is likely to become a reality, as people have different judgments on this. The fact that Ireland supports and has supported for many years a two-state solution for Palestine and Israel answers the Deputy's question inherently. The Deputy mentioned the European commissionership. I wrote to the President elect on 29 July in respect of the nominated Commissioner-designate from Ireland and, in that letter, I stated that I hoped he would assign Mr. Hogan to a position in line with the strength of his skills and of Ireland's political priorities. The agrisector, as Deputy Adams knows, will grow significantly over the next period, and the potential is very significant, particularly with quotas going in 2015. It is important also to recognise that while a number of Vice-Presidents are appointed at Commissioner level, the agrisector and the agricultural portfolio is one that stands alone. It is of such importance to our country that there is probably only one other country in the world that has the same profile as Ireland, and that is New Zealand. It is important to have a strong voice from a European perspective, and this is not focused unilaterally on Ireland. The Commissioner will have to deal with the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, negotiations that are going on between Europe and the United States. Obviously, there is a case to be made for opening the US market to Irish beef, but also the Mercosur negotiations and the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy will also be important. Deputy Adams will be well aware that, in the past, a different formula was used by some of the Commissioners for dealing with the agrisector, which was assessed on a per-hectare basis, but this would have done away with the question of the productivity capacity of Irish farms and how sophisticated we have become. The Deputy also made the point that he was highly critical of the former Minister, Mr. Hogan, with respect to the work he did here. It is as contradictory as ever that Sinn Féin representatives here in the Republic voted against the Commissioner's appointment, yet its Minister in Northern Ireland wrote to him congratulating him. Which is it? I notice the representatives of Sinn Féin in the Twenty-six Counties changed tack afterwards and said they would of course support the Commissioner in what he has to do. If Deputy Adams doubts the Commissioner's credentials, by all accounts, although I do not speak for the European Parliament, at the session dealing with questions to Commissioner designate Hogan, he was outstanding in his delivery, in his knowledge of the subject and in his response to the questions. There seems to have been a bit of a mix-up in the Sinn Féin approach here, or maybe they wanted to cover all bases - the Northern Ireland Minister writes to congratulate the Commissioner, while the members elected from the Twenty-six Counties voted against his appointment. Deputy Adams should remind the farmers of the country and the agrisector that his members did not support the Commissioner's appointment. They might be interested in that when they reflect on it. This is very important for rural Ireland and, as the Deputy points out, it is a critical area. Clearly, there is a lack of infrastructure in regard to broadband, communications, water in many cases, and roads. However, I point out to Deputy Adams that through the rural development programme we will invest €2.2 billion from now to 2020, which is a very significant amount, and, in addition to that, an extra €100 million will be thrown in for the BMW region. I assume Commissioner Hogan, in looking at the pan-European aspect of his rural development programmes, will reflect on that and see that it becomes effective and operational. It is important the Commission approve that programme and that the applications for drawing assistance from it are made available as soon as possible.As I hope to speak to the Commissioner about this in the near future, I do not accept the Deputy's argument. During our Presidency there was a very significant series of decisions on the agriculture sector and the CAP. To have a Commissioner for agriculture from this country heading the EU agriculture process is significant considering that agriculture accounts for 40% of a €960 billion budget.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	181	There are six questions in this group on the appointment during the summer of the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, as well as of Donald Tusk, Federica Mogherini and Phil Hogan. I have tabled two questions. It is fair to say one of the more consistent factors in the past three years is that Ireland regularly supports people for major European posts without asking them questions. The most dramatic and remarkable was when the Taoiseach agreed to the appointment of Mario Draghi as President of the ECB without even meeting him, let alone asking him about his attitude towards Ireland's issues with the ECB. We have issues with it, yet there was no discussion of them with Mr. Draghi. All the indications are that, once again, we have signed off on appointments without seeking assurances on fundamental policies. The Taoiseach will remember that it is about seven weeks since the single supervisory mechanism was brought into operation. That is the deadline he set himself for applying for retrospective aid to help us with bank-related debt. He said over two years ago that Ireland had been dealt with unfairly by the ECB and the European Commission and that in order to preserve the eurozone and in the absence of a bank resolution mechanism in 2010, the European Union had forced individual states into positions into which it should not have forced them. I understand the Government has made no application for retrospective bank debt aid and it appears that none will be made. The Taoiseach has not said one word about it. New office holders are in place and the policy remains the same. I can recall how a year or two ago the Taoiseach trumpeted the idea of a single supervisory mechanism as the key catalyst in moving on Ireland's bank-related debt and seeking retrospection. He will remember the then Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, talking about a seismic change and how the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance talked about billions coming back to the country as a result of the famous summit but nothing has actually happened. Will he confirm that he sought no assurance from President Juncker on bank debts before he agreed to his appointment? It is clear enough from what he has just said that he wrote a letter to President Juncker, but it was all about fixing up Mr. Hogan whom I welcome in the agriculture portfolio. That is fine, but it seems strange that in the letter the Taoiseach did not mention anything about Ireland's bank-related debt and the degree to which the European Union owes Ireland some recompense in dealing with banking issues. The Taoiseach says he had a great relationship with him; therefore, I find it strange that he did not press these issues with him prior to his appointment. Will he indicate how his relationship with President Juncker has helped Ireland on the issues of bank-related debt and retrospection?  The Luxembourg tax story, the subject matter of another question, points mainly to President Juncker's hypocrisy in criticising Ireland in the case of Apple. Ireland was unfairly and deliberately singled out by the Commission. Calling for President Juncker's resignation is not sustainable at this point in time because there is no evidence of any illegality and nobody has produced any evidence, but I find the Government's silence on the matter somewhat incredible. Has the Taoiseach recorded Ireland's demand that all countries, including Luxembourg and the Netherlands, be treated equally and examined at the same time in taxation issues?  On Ms Mogherini's appointment, will the Taoiseach explain whether he discussed her approach to the job with her before agreeing to her appointment? In particular, did he seek assurances that she would not continue the Italian policy of ignoring or downgrading the importance of Russian aggression against Ukraine and the partition of Russia's neighbour, which is a very important issue? Did he have any discussion with her prior to her appointment on the situation in Ukraine and Russia's unacceptable aggression?  Did the Taoiseach ask Donald Tusk, the new President of the Council, to support Ireland's case for full justice on the issue of debt before agreeing to his appointment? What discussions did he have with him before his appointment? In short, it seems that he readily agreed to all of these appointments without in any shape or form presenting Ireland's case for retrospection in the matter of bank-related debt, an issue about which he spoke frequently some years ago but on which he has become strangely silent in more recent times.

The Deputy mentioned President Juncker and his position on the tax issue. First, he was involved in a competition with Michel Barnier for the right to become President-designate of the Commission. That contest and vote were held in the convention centre in Dublin. There was a very enthusiastic and vigorous debate between the two men. Obviously, President Juncker travelled throughout the European Union and to capitals in holding public debates on his views on the development of the Union and so on. A motion of censure against President Juncker was debated last week in Strasbourg and was defeated by 461 votes to 101. It was proposed by the EFDD group, which represents 48 MEPs of the 751 in the European Parliament. None of the other six parties supported the motion. Most speakers argued that it was a time-wasting exercise and that the Commission needed to move forward and concentrate on important agendas-----

As I said, tax systems are matters for each individual country, as they are for this country. The Deputy mentioned Ireland's bank debt. It has clearly been a priority of the Government to ease the burden on taxpayers. The Deputy should not get me started because the Government of which he was a member put €34 billion into a black hole for Anglo Irish Bank that we will never get back. Of course, he has no responsibility for this at all, as if it never happened.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	We have taken a number of steps to achieve this. We recapitalised and restructured the banks, we liquidated the IBRC and we replaced the promissory notes used for recapitalisation with long-term bonds in order to dramatically reduce our own market funding requirements. Those steps have had the effect of stabilising the financial system and reversing the outflow of deposits and other funds that damaged our economy. Deputy Martin is aware that yields are currently at their lowest level in our history. In addition, in 2011 we secured an interest rate reduction in the EFSM and EFSF loans under the programme. In April last year we reached agreement with the 28 countries and eurozone partners to extend the average maturity of the EFSM and EFSF loans by a further seven years. Last December, we exited the programme and, more recently, we secured agreement on the early repayment of a significant portion of our IMF loans, resulting in total interest savings of approximately €1.5 billion. We got approval from all our colleagues in respect of that. It is testament to the resilience of the Irish people and the loyal support of our EU partners that Ireland has been able to return to the markets in a sustainable way, having delivered on all of our commitments in the last three years. However, work remains to be done. In June 2012, the euro area Heads of State and Government resolved to create a banking union to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns, and committed to examining the situation of the Irish financial sector, which was named specifically in that decision. The precondition laid down at that time was for the possible use of the ESM to recapitalise banks directly, with the establishment of a single supervisory mechanism, SSM, for the European banking sector. That legislation was agreed by the Council and the European Parliament during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union last year, and the SSM became operational on 4 November. On 10 June 2014, euro area members reached a preliminary agreement on the operational programme and framework for the ESM's direct recapitalisation instrument. That included a specific provision to keep open the possibility of applying to the ESM for retrospective direct recapitalisation of banks by mutual agreement. This would require unanimous endorsement by the board of directors. An application can only be made when the mechanism enters into force. As a precondition for this, the SSM is now in place and is operational. Another precondition is the completion of national approval procedures for the direct recapitalisation instrument. Our procedures are in place with the enactment of the ESM Amendment Order Act 2014. Once all member states have completed national approval procedures, the ESM could agree to implement the direct recapitalisation instrument. That could happen as early as this month. It is an issue that the Ministers for Finance will address. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has referred to this issue. Clearly, the objective is to get the best possible result for the Irish taxpayer, and the question of keeping open the application for direct recapitalisation still stands.

Investors are again willing to invest in Irish banks, and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly. In Europe, a strategic approach tends to deliver. The Minister for Finance has said that he intends to keep open the option of retrospective recapitalisation, with the timing of any application to be decided in due course.

In formal session of the European Council we discussed the whole question of the European Council's response to the requirement to deal with the OECD programme for BEPS and the tax structures in other countries. Everybody agreed to participate openly and fully in this, as Ireland is doing. That is why, in the most recent budget, the Minister for Finance made the announcement that we have ended the "double Irish" concept with a transition period out to 2020, thereby giving clarity and certainty to companies. We are forthright in our support for that. The answer to Deputy Martin's question is "Yes." The direct recapitalisation concept remains open and on the table, but there are now other options in terms of the value of the banks.

Would he agree, however, that the Luxembourg papers, which were mainly from PricewaterhouseCoopers, revealed a system of tax evasion on an industrial scale? A huge number of companies, including Pepsi, Ikea, Heinz, JP Morgan, FedEx, Deutsche Bank, Macquarie, Shire, ICAP and Dyson, had arrangements with Luxembourg which were seen to be facilitated by this country. People might say this is legal tax avoidance, but is it not shameful that Mr. Juncker, as Prime Minister of a small state which is approximately the size of County Meath and which was a founder member of the European Union, presided over and managed a massive system of tax avoidance and tax evasion by these multinationals? The Taoiseach referred to a vote by the European Parliament in which his own grouping, the EPP, as well as the Party of European Socialists, supported the appointment of Mr. Juncker. They also refused to support a vote of censure. Does the Taoiseach not think it is inappropriate for this person to be President of the European Commission, given that almost any pronouncement he might make about tax harmonisation or countries such as Luxembourg, Ireland or the Netherlands will be tinged with hypocrisy? Is it not appropriate that, as my colleague Nessa Childers, MEP, has called for, a special committee of inquiry be established to investigate the role he played as Minister for finance and Prime Minister of Luxembourg over the two decades in question? Would the Taoiseach support the European Parliament in conducting such an inquiry? To the general public, there is no question that Mr. Juncker is totally unsuitable and inappropriate as leader of the European Commission.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	243	President Juncker is a politician with considerable experience. It is not for me to comment on the tax structures of any individual country. We have our own structures, and we have been forthright in defending them. There were some comments internationally about the concept of the double Irish and the concept of statelessness. We got rid of that. The only way of having a system that really stands up is where all countries work together within an overall framework for a global economy, and that is where we are. The European Council has agreed on that. I remind the Deputy that on 24 October the European Council, as a representative of the 28 countries, ratified his appointment as President of the Commission and, earlier in the week, there was a free vote in plenary session of European Parliament, whereby the 751 Members, who represent all countries and shades of political opinion, voted strongly in favour of President Juncker and the 27 other Commissioners.I obviously do not speak for the European Parliament. It is well able to make up its own mind and its decision was clear. I wish him the best in his Presidency. He has appointed a number of former Prime Ministers to look after groups of strategies. The reason for that, which I discussed with him, was to appoint people who understand politics and that when decisions are made they should be followed through, not swallowed up and strangled in bureaucracy, red tape and administrative obstacles. I hope that when this Commission makes its decisions politically, it will be able to follow through on them on a clearly defined path that will make them effective. Deputy Broughan is well aware of issues that were decided by the European Commission but that subsequently got bogged down in mounds of paper which made them unworkable. The reason for having Vice Presidents of the Commission who were former Prime Ministers in their individual countries was that they understand that political decisions should be followed through in a way that makes them workable and effective for what they are intended to do.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	The Taoiseach did not answer the two questions I put to him. One was whether, in light of the threat to the local development sector and the concerns raised by many in local rural communities, and particularly the questions from the European Commission, the Government was willing to review its programme for rural development from 2014 to 2020. Perhaps he will take the opportunity to answer it. Instead, he waltzed off on a little adventure of his own. It is entirely appropriate for a Minister for agriculture to welcome the appointment of a European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development. It is also entirely appropriate to be critical of the method of selection, as I was today, and to be critical of the actions of the person who was appointed Commissioner. The other question I asked was, given the position of the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, whether the Government was for the objective which she outlined, a Palestinian state. This is the position of the European Union. What I have been seeking from the Government for a long time is that it uphold international law and employ our reputation in terms of our peace process and our history to set an example and to defend the two-state proposition regarding the right of the people of Israel and, particularly and especially, the right of the people of Palestine. That can take many forms. One example is the attitude towards the Palestinian mission. I have asked numerous times for it to be upgraded to a full embassy, but that has not happened. The Taoiseach said that the answer to my question is inherent in the Government's support for a two-state solution. The Taoiseach uses the words "clarity" and "certainty" a great deal, so why can he not just state the position as it is, that we support the right of the people of Palestine to have their own state and that we will accord them the necessary entitlements in that regard? When I raise this issue, the Taoiseach refers to international law. If we do not uphold it, who will? The separation wall and the blockade of Gaza are breaches of international law. There are numerous other breaches of international law, so perhaps the Taoiseach will give a clear answer. On a more positive note, I understand the Government decided today to request the European Court of Human Rights to revise the judgment on the hooded men. Will the Taoiseach comment on that? If this is the case, I welcome it very much. Not only is it the right of the men and their families, but also in terms of international practice we have seen torture used in other conflict situations and this has been facilitated by that flawed judgment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	245	The key point I put to the Taoiseach was in respect of the debt retrospection. The Taoiseach accepted in a statement made in Paris that Europe would not accept any burning of bondholders - that was the bottom line - or any bank failing. It was a European-imposed solution, not just on Ireland but also on other countries. In fact, European policy exacerbated the crisis in many respects for the first three years of the crisis. It was only the appointment of Mario Draghi and his intervention that put the euro on a different course. He was responsible for the reduction in interest rates, not anybody else, and he has been responsible for the low yields on Government bonds, not anybody else. The Taoiseach mentioned the summit in 2012 in his reply. I vividly recall the reaction of the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach at that time. They said this was a massive deal. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, speculated that billions of euro would come back to Ireland. All of that sense of excitement at seismic deals and a huge dividend has dissipated and been reduced to the phrase "keeps open the possibility", which the Taoiseach used in his reply. That is all. At the time, however, a different sense was conveyed. When the Taoiseach met Mr. Juncker - Mr. Juncker met all Heads of State prior to his appointment, just as his predecessor did - was he asked if there would be a special deal for Ireland, along the lines of the 2012 June summit, in terms of Europe at least acknowledging that Ireland took one for the rest of the eurozone and deserves some recompense as a result? Did he discuss that with Mr. Juncker prior to his appointment? With regard to tax, I did not ask about his involvement or that of the European Parliament. The hypocrisy stems from the fact that different countries do different things on tax and their tax offerings and Ireland was singled out in terms of the alleged situation with Apple. Our foreign direct investment, FDI, is extremely important and accounts for more than 260,000 jobs. Apple employes 4,500 people in Cork and many other companies do likewise. They also help small and medium-sized companies. When the Taoiseach engaged with Mr. Juncker on the tax question, did he put it to him, the Commission and Mr. Donald Tusk that all countries must be treated equally, including not only Ireland but also Luxembourg, the Netherlands and others, in terms of their offering on FDI, and that there should be consistent equality across the board? The Taoiseach did not reply to my question about Ms Mogherini with regard to Ukraine. The Italians have a different perspective from other European states on Russian aggression and that has been consistent for some time. Did the Taoiseach have any discussion with her about the unacceptable aggression by Russia in Ukraine?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	246	There was considerable speculation about the potential appointment of Ms Mogherini in the first instance. People thought that some of the comments that had been made were very soft towards Russia. The Prime Minister of Italy, Matteo Renzi, was very clear that her appointment, if sanctioned, would clearly take into account and follow the European Council's view in respect of the attitude towards Russia and its involvement with Ukraine and earlier with Crimea. The speculation that existed on the part of a number of member states was certainly cleared by the Prime Minister when he spoke and obviously when Ms Mogherini spoke. The Deputy is aware that Ireland was not the only country singled out by the European Commission on tax issues. The Commission launched preliminary investigations against a number of countries. We defended Ireland's case and will continue to do so arising from the Apple hearings in the US Senate. We have made that perfectly clear. The view of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is that this case will be dropped. Ireland has been very clear through the years that no special deals were done by the Revenue Commissioners for any companies in Ireland. We are perfectly entitled under international law to discuss options that are open to any company investing in this country, as the Deputy will know from his time in government. Ours is not the only country that was the focus of attention from the Commission. In addition, there was a very clear response from the European Council that every country should involve itself openly in getting an overall international response to the tax position. When I was in America recently, the question of the double Irish concept arose. Some companies raised it, others indicated they would be nervous of it or would move on it themselves. Last year, Ireland dealt with the stateless concept and this year with the double Irish. I very well recall the European Council meeting at 4 a.m. and Ireland being the first country out through the gap with a debt of €64 billion. It was a very significant achievement to have Ireland named in the Council's decision to separate bank and sovereign debt as being eligible for consideration for recapitalisation. The question is what is the best thing for the Irish taxpayer. We put €4 billion into Bank of Ireland and got back €6 billion, and we still own 14% or 15% of the bank, which the Minister will retain for the sake of ability to influence bank policy. We own 99% of AIB. We must consider its value and what we should do with it and whether it would be better, as the Minister has reflected on numerous times, to lodge an application for direct recapitalisation under the scheme agreed. In June 2012, it could not have been followed through until the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, and banking union concept were put together. From engaging with officials over those years, I know it was incredibly complex and some of the negotiations went on for weeks and months and faced much resistance from some other countries regarding particular aspects. It is operational and Ireland has a number of options. We could follow the decision and apply for direct recapitalisation on the basis of what we might get from it, which would require unanimous approval from the board of governors. We could consider what is the best option in the interests of the taxpayer. The Minister is reflecting on the concept of AIB, its value and how the value is determined. I have had a number of conversations with Mr. Draghi about Ireland's position. His impact on the ECB has been very significant and he has said he would do whatever it takes to sustain and protect the euro. With interest rates and inflation as low as they are, he is considering the question of quantitative easing. His presentations to the European Council are very comprehensive and detailed. He wants to stimulate the European economy for growth and investment and, as a consequence, for jobs. I have spoken to him directly about this over recent years. SSM is in place, the conditions are there for an application and the Government must consider what is the best option open to us in the interests of the taxpayer.

Far be it from me to forget Deputy Adams. He mentioned "waltzing off" on a tangent.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	251	I expect it will be an important position over the next number of years, given the importance of the agrisector, and 40% of the budget of €860 billion over the next seven years. I expect the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, in heading up the agrisector in Europe, will allow the different sectors to flourish and, hopefully, it will become evident in Ireland. The rural development programme was adopted and proposed during Ireland's presidency and we have submitted our programme nationally to the Commission for approval, and it included €2.2 billion. I expect the Commissioner will work with the different programmes from the different countries, have them approved, and then we need to move on so the application forms for the various sectoral interests can be sent out to the community and people can begin to draw it down. An extra €100 million was thrown into the pot for the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region because of the low level of per capita income in some of the areas there. I hope it will follow through. It is an important programme. As the Deputy is well aware, rural development throughout many of the counties here must be attended to. While the macro figures are going well for the big cities, the Government wants it to spread throughout the entire district and every county, and hopefully it will happen. The Government took into account the legal advice received in respect of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, judgment decision in the case of Ireland v. the UK, known as the hooded men. At today's meeting, the Government gave authorisation to re-open the case. It must be done before tomorrow, as the Deputy knows. It is a serious matter and the advice has ranged over a number of issues. On 4 June 2014, there was a "Prime Time" documentary called "RTE Investigations Unit: The Torture Files". Today, the Government considered all the implications of it and agreed that a case should be opened in respect of a revision of the judgment. The British Government has been notified. It is not for the Government to determine the outcome of the case. The ECHR will make a decision both on the early presentation of the case involved and what it means. It goes back to a time when a case between Ireland and the UK was brought before the European Commission and the ECHR instituted proceedings in 1971. The deadline is tomorrow. The case dealt with human rights violations arising from internment in Northern Ireland. A particular focus of the proceedings was the use of the so called five techniques of interrogation involving 14 detainees. Last week, a number of these men went to the court seeking a case. This was a matter for the Government to consider and the case was argued very clearly. The Government's decision to reopen the case will be followed through by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the British Government has been notified of the Irish Government's decision.

Sweden has moved on it. We support the achievement of a Palestinian state. The Israeli Government is building housing on areas of the West Bank. If we are not going to have a comprehensive agreement on what constitutes Palestine and what constitutes Israel, we go back to 1948 and the two state solution. Sweden has made its decision and there has been action in Spain and the UK and talk of it in France. A clear series of messages is going to Israel. The Government can continue to wait in the hope of a comprehensive peace agreement, or it can decide to redefine its support for the achievement of a Palestinian state.I have spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about this and the Government will consider it in the not too distant future. Given that we support a two-state solution, Deputy Adams is asking me now if I recognise the current status of Palestine. Areas there have been built on heavily, as the Deputy is well aware in terms of the subject of discussion here. The Government will look at a redefinition of recognition of the current extent of Palestine, and the Minister will come to the House in due course to discuss that.

My colleague Nessa Childers, MEP, the only Irish member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, has been a strong supporter of the idea of an inquiry. Given that we know through the Lux Leaks investigation that Luxembourg gave approximately 550 advance tax agreements or comfort letters to these multinationals, a small number of which this country was also indirectly involved in, is it not an unsustainable situation that the European Commission would be investigating the tax policy of Luxembourg while headed by the person who presided over that tax policy for so long? Will the Taoiseach agree that Jean-Claude Juncker's position is untenable and that he should step aside?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	277	In respect of Deputy Broughan's comment on Jean-Claude Juncker, I do not accept that at all. There was a full scale plenary session of the European Parliament last week where a motion of censure was put against the Juncker Commission. That was debated and there were 101 votes for the motion and 461 votes against. It was supported by the 48 MEPs of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy, EFDD, group, out of 751 members. None of the other six parties supported the motion. Therefore, I do not accept the Deputy's argument at all. President Juncker was endorsed by the European Council, representing all of the 28 countries, and by the European Parliament, covering all shades of political opinion. The Deputy's MEP colleague is quite entitled under the rules of the European Parliament to follow the procedures it adopts, and the European Commission is now a new Commission and is quite entitled to follow its nose wherever it thinks it should go. I will not interfere with the workings of the European Parliament or any of the Members who know the rules and procedures there. In respect of Deputy Mathews-----

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together. The most recent meeting of the Cabinet committee on European Union affairs was on Thursday, 6 November. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for this month. The Cabinet committee on European affairs meets regularly throughout the year to discuss and shape Ireland's strategic approach to our European Union engagement. The committee will continue to work to ensure a coherent approach across all policy areas, particularly in relation to priority issues for Ireland and, above all, to anchor Ireland's influence and interests in Brussels. This strategic approach at EU level will continue to include engagement at bilateral level with fellow member states and alliance-building with key partners.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	291	I understand the Cabinet committee on European Union affairs deals with a range of issues and that the Minister for Finance is among its members, yet the huge issue of bank recapitalisation has seen little or no action by the Government. It seems to me that the Government wants the Irish people to forget about the prospect of retroactive recapitalisation of our banking debt. We were told a number of years ago - I know the Taoiseach dealt with this earlier - that we had a game changer and that there was a great victory, but now another European Council meeting has come and gone and its conclusions do not mention any moves towards retrospective recapitalisation for this State. That is costing every man, woman and child here €14,000 per annum. Could the Taoiseach outline the steps that have been taken? Could he tell us - it is not a State secret - when he intends to apply for retroactive recapitalisation and when that will apply, and can he inform the Dáil about his plans around this hugely important issue?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	The answer to the Deputy's question is that it is a case of deciding on the options that are in the best interests of the Irish taxpayer. We could not apply for direct recapitalisation under the decision of June 2012 until we put all the steps in place, including the single supervisory mechanism, SSM, the banking union concept, and all those complicated issues.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	293	That is all in place.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	294	That is all done, so it is now open to the Government to apply for recapitalisation if it so decides. What should the Government decide? What the Government has to do, and what it should do, is to make a decision as to what is in the best interests of the Irish taxpayer. In other words, were we to apply for recapitalisation, let us say we would get X amount, whereas if we look at the question of the banks we have an interest in, that is-----
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	295	The Taoiseach is not answering the question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	296	I will answer the question if the Deputy lets me finish. We put €4 billion into the Bank of Ireland; we got back €6 billion. We still own 14% or 15% of that. We own 99% of AIB. Which is the better option? Is it to hold that in the knowledge that we have made a profit for the taxpayer from Bank of Ireland already and we still own that element of it? What do we do with AIB? How do we determine its value? What should we do over a period? Would we get back more for the taxpayer than if we applied for direct recapitalisation? On the latter question, if we do apply, and if we get full consent from all the governors - unanimous agreement - and we get X amount back for the Irish taxpayer, what would we do if we were to suddenly find that the value of what we hold in AIB is vastly greater? The Government has to make a choice here in the interests of the taxpayer. What is the best thing to do? What is the best option? As the Minister for Finance has pointed out, Government will consider and reflect on this very carefully. We have options. We had no option before because the thing was completely defunct and had to be restructured. The Deputy will recall all the questions he asked here week after week, such as whether we were going to borrow €3 billion to pay the interest in Anglo Irish Bank. That crowd on the opposite side of the House put €34 billion into Anglo Irish Bank and we will never get it back. At least we have a chance with the options we now have for the taxpayer.

When will the energy (miscellaneous provisions) Bill be brought before the House? Recently in answering ministerial questions the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, agreed to have a debate on broadband provision. When will the debate be held because there is major concern, particularly in rural communities, about broadband provision? Nobody believes the latest proposal from the Government to address the issue.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	312	The EirGrid and energy (miscellaneous provisions) Bills will be taken in the first half of next year. With regard to the discussion on broadband communications the Deputy mentioned, last Monday the Minister published the information on mapping in County Clare. It is a matter for the Whips to arrange a time and there is no difficulty except in finding an opportunity to debate the issue.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	315	I refer to three items, the health information Bill, the housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and the housing regulation Bill. There is also the legislation on EpiPens. Táimid ag fanacht leis an health information Bill le tamall fada anois agus tá sé ar an gclár le tamall fada anuas fosta. The Bill has been designed to provide a legislative framework for the better governance of health information initiatives. I understand the alarming rate of suicide is one of the issues that could be addressed. Can we have a timeframe for its introduction, given the seriousness of the issues with which it deals? While it is not always the case, I note that legislation is sometimes promised but is then sent back to be redrafted before the process of pre-legislative scrutiny begins. Before the Government runs out of time, will it speed up the work on some of these issues? On the housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, homelessness is one of the biggest issues. Mar atá a fhios ag na Baill agus ag an Taoiseach, tá a lán daoine ag stopadh ar na sráideanna gach oíche sa chathair seo agus ar fud na Stáite agus fuair an fear bocht sin bás cúpla oíche ó shin. Dúirt an Taoiseach go raibh sé ag caint le daoine nuair a bhí sé ag siúl thart agus bhí mise ag caint le daoine fosta. There are two separate Bills which have been promised on this issue. Will the housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill be brought forward as a matter of urgency? When will the housing regulation Bill be published? Can we have a sense of the timeframe involved?

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	The EpiPen legislation promised by the Minister for Health who met the mother of Emma Sloan who died from anaphylaxis. The Minister promised legislation in 2015 to deal with the issues raised by her. There is not enough education or information available and lives can be saved through the introduction of legislation and the provision of EpiPens and information for the folks involved. The legislation is at an early stage, but, given that the Minister has made a commitment which I welcome and that the mother of the child has been so active in trying to ensure no other child suffers the same fate, perhaps we might have a sense of when there will be the wider availability of life-saving EpiPens and when the new education programme will be rolled out.

The housing regulation Bill and the housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will both be seen by the end of spring or early summer. It means that we must deal with the emergency in respect of decisions the Government has already made. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, will meet the groups in Dublin on Thursday and this will be followed by a meeting with the Cabinet sub-committee on Monday. We will take whatever decisions we must take on Tuesday to make this more effective. I cannot answer the question about the good lady whose daughter died, but I will have the Minister for Health communicate with the Deputy.

It also has the third highest rate of underemployed people in the European Union. In its statement published six months ago the Government promised to put a low pay commission on a statutory basis. The drafts heads of the Bill have not yet been seen. When will we see the legislation? Two years ago under the credit guarantee scheme it was promised that €450 million would be available to 5,600 businesses to create 4,000 jobs.What we have seen is €15 million, 11 companies and 870 jobs. The promised credit guarantee (amendment) Bill is supposed to address these shortfalls and is due to be published in the current session. An bhfeicfimid an Bille seo roimh an Nollaig?

The Government has given authorisation and approval for the legislation to establish the low pay commission. Work is under way on the terms and conditions that will apply to it.

I replied to the questions on the basis of the information provided by Shannon Airport Authority. Shannon Airport Authority has now informed my Department that it has identified an error in its recording of the registration of this aircraft and has provided confirmation of the details of the aircraft in question. I can confirm to the House that the aircraft identified by Deputy Clare Daly in the four parliamentary questions was in fact granted permission to land at Shannon Airport on 30 September this year. The permission to land was granted subject to the strict conditions which apply to foreign military aircraft, including stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question must not form part of military exercises or operations. I apologise to the House for this error. The Shannon Airport Authority has apologised to me for this administrative error and has assured me that additional control measures have been put in place to avoid any recurrence.

The Bill will amend the Water Services Act 2013 to ensure the board of Irish Water is fully subject to freedom of information legislation. It will create a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water. We know there have been many disputes with the company already. The Bill proposes Irish Water be made a fully publicly owned entity and be prohibited from entering into a public private partnership without recourse to a referendum. The Bill also proposes the Minister will direct the subsidiary known as Irish Water within two years of establishment to provide for an insurance policy to all customers with respect of water leakage and damaged infrastructure in their property and homes. It is important we proceed with this Bill, despite all the fanfare and damage limitation measures announced in the House over two weeks ago by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. Rarely has the House witnessed such a brazen and arrogant delivery of so-called reforms from a Minister more concerned with his legacy than listening to the people of the country, not to mention Tipperary. The creation of a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water is absolutely vital.Much has been made of the Government's commitment to establishing a public forum on a statutory basis to ensure the voice of the people is heard. While these are laudable goals, we should not fool ourselves that a forum with significant statutory powers will emerge from the process. There is a big difference between providing a space for people to talk and acting upon the words spoken. Just ask the Ministers of this Government who were denied access to the Economic Management Council, which consisted of the big four members of Government. If Government Ministers can only apply a rubber stamp to decisions of this council, what hope has the public of being heard? The Government record on reform and the introduction of a more participatory democratic process is one of abysmal failure, as noted by Deputy Mathews a few minutes ago. On a practical note, what model will the forum follow? What weight will be accorded to the opinions of members of the public who engage in the process? Why do we need another model when an ombudsman with clear and forceful statutory powers to act in the public interest is a better alternative? We already have an ombudsman with plenty of experience. Like many aspects of this debate, I believe the forum is designed to give the appearance that the Government is listening when the opposite is the case. The matters I have mentioned are linked to another provision in my Bill that seeks to have the actions of the board of Irish Water fully subject to freedom of information, FOI, legislation. Section 3 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 provides that regulations may be made to extend the Act's coverage. I am aware that in January the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, agreed to the principle contained in the Bill but it is unclear whether the FOI provisions he has spoken of will extend to the merged boards of Ervia and Irish Water. I believe this merger will require amendments to the Gas Act 1976 and the Water Services Act 2013. I hope the debate on the Bill will provide an occasion for such clarity to be secured. In any event, more debate is required on the mechanisms to hold Irish Water accountable. We must try to tame the beast that is Irish Water because one issue after another has led to trouble. I feel we must focus more on the issues of insurance policies, leaks and damage to water infrastructure. Irish Water has shown itself to be arrogant and out of touch with the call-out charges it submitted to the regulator. If these charges are allowed, they will have a more detrimental effect on family incomes than the capped charges. The price of capped charges for three years would not match call-out charges and associated costs.

I hope it will be debated, amended as necessary and discussed openly and fairly. Ná bí ag magadh. This is a serious issue and the Government should not pour cold water on the fire. It is a fire brigade reaction to an honest effort by me.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	397	I thank the Acting Chairman and I thank the Minister for taking this matter. I believe we have a problem with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and how it interprets its own code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs. I refer, in particular, to recent rulings by the BAI under this code that some people saw as not fair and objective but daft and depressing. These rulings led the National Union of Journalists to say the authority is acting in a manner harmful to the public interest, and this is a serious charge to level. Two complaints were made recently regarding radio shows discussing marriage equality issues and in my view they were spurious complaints. The complaints were upheld on the requirement to present a balanced view, but the shows in question were not current affairs programmes discussing a matter relating to a referendum campaign that is under way. In those circumstances there is a duty to be objective and include all sides of a debate. These shows were not debates. One was an RTE programme in January 2014 and it was a human interest piece on civil partnerships with people telling their personal stories. The other was a Newstalk programme in June 2014 on the Dublin gay pride parade with people discussing and celebrating rights, some of which they do not currently have. For too long such people have been outcasts in Irish society and the State and, thankfully, we are moving to correct this next year. The programmes in question were not discussing matters in the context of a referendum campaign and they were not conducting debates. A referendum campaign is not yet under way. These were popular and important radio shows that were giving voice to people who have a different point of view from other people. I hope in time that point of view will be regarded as normal. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland objected on the basis that one could not allow a person to speak on radio about his or her aspirations to marry without having another person, a guest or presenter to challenge those aspirations, hopes, dreams and fears. I do not think this is right. Not only does it set a worrying precedent for free speech in the media in Ireland but it lacks common sense. Senator Zappone challenged the authority of the BAI, apparently correctly, as the Government has failed to make appointments to the authority and, as a result, it is having difficulties obtaining a quorum at meetings. The Senator succinctly asked who calls the shots and makes the rulings at the BAI. Where is the legitimacy in these rulings if there are governance issues at the authority? The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has strongly criticised the BAI and has said it has used the complaints to chill public discussion on equality. This is a very serious thing to say. A referendum on marriage equality is approaching.It is coming, and I am looking forward to voting "Yes" in that referendum. We should ask ourselves whether the authority is fit to make rulings on future complaints that may arise between now and the beginning of that referendum campaign or once the referendum is under way. We need to move quickly to address the governance issues in the authority, if they exist, and how the authority is interpreting the rulings under its code. If the code was not written to chill public debate or prevent people from expressing a point of view in the normal way on something they are passionate about, without having to bring someone in to put them down, then perhaps the code needs to be amended. Will the Minister offer a view on these issues?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	398	I thank Deputy Eoghan Murphy for raising this issue. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is an independent statutory body which has as one of its functions under section 26 the Broadcasting Act 2009 the preparation of broadcasting codes or rules. Accordingly, I, as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, have no function in this matter and my Department has no role in the consultation process or in the drawing up of codes. The BAI is required to draw up and enforce a series of codes for broadcasters on the basis of a list set out in section 42(2) of the 2009 Broadcasting Act. The first two items on the list deal with news broadcasting, including objectivity and impartiality in news broadcasting, and the broadcast treatment of current affairs. News and current affairs content broadcast on Irish radio and television is required to comply with the 2009 Act and with the BAI code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs. The statutory requirements and the BAI code require news and current affairs to be fair, objective and impartial. The BAI has prepared detailed guidance notes to accompany the code to assist broadcasters in their interpretation. The notes are provided as an aid to understanding the intent of the principles and rules and the manner of their application in a broadcast context. One issue about which there has been some discussion recently is the role of the presenter. The guidance notes recognise the vital role of a programme presenter. They highlight, however, that the role comes with attendant responsibilities. The aim of the code in this regard is to seek to prevent a partisan position from being advocated by a presenter and to guard against a presenter using his or her programme to pursue an agenda via comments, choice of guests or otherwise such that a biased view on an issue is articulated. The code also sets out the manner in which complaints may be made about a particular problem. Any person is entitled to make a complaint about news and current affairs content. In the first instance, complaints should be directed to the broadcaster to consider on the basis of the code of practice for complaints handling. Section 47 requires broadcasters to consider all such complaints. Complainants may refer complaints to the BAI if they are not satisfied with the response provided by the broadcaster or where the broadcaster does not respond. One common issue arising in complaints dealing with fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs relates to balanced coverage. The BAI has stated on many occasions that there is no automatic requirement for each topic to be balanced by an opposing view. While there are some instances where balance may be required - for example, in the case of a closely fought referendum - an automatic requirement is considered inappropriate. This has been made clear in several codes and documents published by the BAI since its inception in 2009. The codes to be followed by broadcasters are published by the BAI. The requirements in respect of balance and fairness are not confined to the period of a referendum. Particular rules relate to the period of a referendum, but there are general rules in respect of fairness and balance that are not confined to referendum periods. I have no wish to express any view in respect of any particular complaint or issue. However, for the information of the Deputy and the House, I note that rule 22 of the BAI code states: "a presenter and/or a reporter on a current affairs programme shall not express his or her own views on matters that are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debate such that a partisan position is advocated." It may be that from time to time listeners, politicians or otherwise regard a particular point of view expressed in a programme as one with which they are less than comfortable. However, we need a third party to determine complaints in an objective way. It should not be done by politicians or otherwise. The Oireachtas has set up a third party to do this. Whereas people may have views as to the outcome of this or that complaint, we should support the independent body set up by the Oireachtas to make decisions on the basis of complaints made and brought freely pursuant to the codes. We should support the BAI in this regard. This does not mean we must agree with all of the authority's decisions, any more than we would agree with the decisions of courts or other quasi-judicial bodies, but the authority should be given the freedom to do the job we have asked of it.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	399	I completely respect the idea that the authority must be independent and that we need a third party to rule on these things, but what if the third party is wrong? What if we believe it is acting irresponsibly or inappropriately? To whom is the authority responsible at that point? What if, in setting up the code of conduct according to specifications in the Act, the authority did not proceed as it was intended under the legislation? Is there no point at which the Minister can review the legislation, the authority or the code? I appreciate the Minister's response, in which he referred to instances where balance may be required and where an automatic requirement for balance is considered inappropriate. If there is a closely fought referendum the former may apply. Is there not a contradiction in the rulings on the two specific issues raised? They relate to the same issue, that is to say, the debate on marriage equality. One related to people talking about civil partnership some years after agreeing a civil partnership, what it meant to them and how they looked forward to marriage equality. The other related to the gay pride parade in Dublin. Of course we are going to talk about marriage equality in the context of that debate. Of course there should be no automatic expectation of a contrary view in that case. How could anyone interpret the code of the BAI to deem it necessary for a contrary view in these two instances, both of which relate to marriage equality? This does not look good for the BAI. There are legitimate public concerns on this issue because many people have been talking about it. Where is the mechanism by which we can argue that there may be a legitimate reason for us not to interfere with the independence of the authority? How do we assess whether it is acting in accordance with the legislation as set up? The Irish Council for Civil Liberties expressed concern publicly about the possibility that some of these rulings could have a chilling effect on public debate. The National Union of Journalists referred to this decision being harmful to the public interest. Therefore, we cannot sit back and take the view that the authority is an independent entity which we set up in 2009 with a code drafted by the authority itself and therefore we cannot get involved. We must consider the matter and establish what mechanisms we can use to ensure it is acting in accordance with the best interests of public debate. The Minister referenced other parts of the code in respect of issues of controversy. This is not an issue of controversy. Some people might have a difficulty accepting the way Irish society is going, but we should consider the public interest. Here we are one year before a referendum is to be held and people are talking about an event in which they are participating. As part of that discussion people are projecting a view on something that may happen in future and the broadcaster is doing the same. That is not controversial, and the BAI should not be able to intervene, declare this inappropriate and rule against the parties involved on the matter.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	400	I have no wish to trespass on the particular issue, but where there is a difference in point of view there is likely to be a controversy. The fact that we have a particular viewpoint on an issue and others have a different view would seem to point to the existence of a controversy. The fact results from people disagreeing with a particular decision. I am at pains to emphasise that I am not trespassing on the particular issue. However, the fact that Deputy Eoghan Murphy, I or others might think something is wrong or might disagree with a decision made does not impugn the integrity of the body or third party making that decision. The point is to take it away from the political system or any third party other than one set up properly under legislation. I respect that Deputy Eoghan Murphy has raised this issue, but he made a point about whether the BAI was acting in accordance with legislation. I have no reason to believe from anything that I have seen from the BAI in this regard or anything with respect to what the Deputy has said this afternoon, even remotely, that the BAI is not acting in accordance with the legislation. Reference was made to the codes the BAI has published. As I understand it, these were done after a lengthy consultation period. I am unsure whether the issue relates to the code or the particular outcome. Another point is relevant to this issue. This morning, on my nomination, the Government agreed to appoint five new members to the broadcasting authority because the term of office of the previous authority had come to an end. I thank the outgoing members of the BAI under the leadership of Bob Collins. The new members will take up office immediately under the chairmanship of Dr. Pauric Travers.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	401	I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this Topical Issue matter. While the Government has ring-fenced almost €13 million for flood defences in Skibbereen, many concerns have been raised locally about slippage in the planned schedule of works for the scheme. Last year, an estimated 59 mm of rain fell in the space of six hours between the hours of 6 p.m. on Thursday, 24 October and 2 a.m. on Friday, 25 October. It was a deluge that saw the black tarred roads of Skibbereen flowing like a river. Skibbereen has been inundated with flood waters many times over the years, especially in 2009. After the 2009 flood, which caused devastation to 200 businesses and residences, many people are now without flood cover and have no hope of getting it. Earlier this year, the previous Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, the former Deputy Brian Hayes, visited Skibbereen. I attended a meeting with him with representatives from the locality and other public representatives. The then Minister of State said he realised the personal and economic impact of flooding. He assured locals: "The Government is absolutely committed to protecting the town and, when completed, the scheme will provide 200-year flood event protection to approximately 179 homes and 131 commercial properties." Since it was first announced that Skibbereen needed a flood relief scheme, the project has been dogged by delays. Each of the phases of the scheme has been affected by a delay of three or four months. Work was originally due to begin in the second half of 2014 and was expected to be completed within 18 months. It was envisaged that the detailed design process would commence before the end of November 2013 and it was hoped to complete it and the process of procuring a civil works contractor around mid-2014. This would have allowed construction to commence in the third quarter of 2014 but this, alas, has not happened. In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled in September, the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, who is in the House, outlined the current position with regard to the Skibbereen flood relief scheme. He indicated that it was at the stage of procurement of civil works contractors and that contractors would be appointed after a two-stage process. The process was stated to be at the pre-qualification stage which would produce a shortlist of contractors to be invited to tender. The second stage of the process was expected to commence shortly and it was hoped that the OPW would be in a position to appoint contractors early in 2015. As each month passes, people are becoming increasingly frustrated and exceptionally concerned. Each month of slippage allows for more potential flooding, particularly at this time of year, with the consequent expense to residents and businesses. As a flooded community, the people of Skibbereen want the flood relief scheme back on track and work to commence as soon as possible. I accept that there is no quick-fix solution and that it will take time, but we need action and to see construction beginning. The OPW must take seriously the near constant threat of flooding and the absolute devastation that would be caused in Skibbereen. I would be very grateful to the Minister of State for his personal attention and interest in advancing this flood relief scheme. I note that he is visiting Clonakilty on Monday, 15 December to launch the public consultation phase of the Clonakilty flood relief scheme. I call on him to visit Skibbereen also and meet the group I met recently in my constituency office in Dunmanway. They are between the devil and the deep blue sea, if the Minister of State will excuse the pun. If anything happens in the current climate, it will mean utter devastation. Defence works have not started and people do not have flood cover. It is an horrendous situation and I ask the Minister of State to give it his personal attention.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	402	I thank Deputy Michael McCarthy for giving me the opportunity to provide an update to the House by raising this important matter for the people of Skibbereen this evening. I assure him that his request that I give the matter my personal attention is one to which I am happy to accede. I had an opportunity last Thursday to address the Seanad about flooding and to outline the following. In my five months in this job, I have visited many areas of the country that have been affected by flooding and heard at first hand the experiences of people who have seen their homes, businesses and farms damaged by flood waters. I am very aware of the hardship and, as the Deputy correctly puts it, utter devastation people have suffered because of flooding and appreciate the frustration that people such as the residents of Skibbereen feel at the length of time it takes to get a flood defence scheme in place. I assure the Deputy, the House and the people of Skibbereen at the outset that the Skibbereen scheme is a priority. It is a priority for me, the Government and the Office of Public Works. The preparatory work is being progressed as quickly as possible by Cork County Council working on behalf of and with funding from the OPW with a view to commencing construction as early as possible in 2015. The council has been working on a proposed scheme since late 2009 when a severe flood event affected the town with more than 200 properties reported to have been flooded. With the assistance of OPW funding, the council appointed consultants in early 2011 to design a scheme to be brought forward for consultation with the public. The main proposals of the scheme include the construction of new walls and embankments along the River Ilen and some of its tributaries in the town, new pumping stations, localised channel regrading and improvements to the local drainage system. There have been many opportunities for the public to engage with the design team, including public information days held in March 2011 and January 2012, and the formal public exhibition over a four-week period in April and May 2013. A large number of submissions, some quite detailed, were made following the exhibition. This level of engagement and input from the local community in the development of a scheme is very important. Some submissions, for example, raised concerns over the levels of protection to be provided in certain areas based on past experiences of local people which led to a review of some aspects of the proposed scheme. We have very good engineers in the OPW, as they have in Cork County Council, but no matter how good one's engineers are, one cannot beat the knowledge of local people who have experienced flooding themselves. I was very grateful to the people of Skibbereen for their input and the benefits there have been to the proposed scheme as a result. In recognition of the valuable contribution that local knowledge can make to fine-tuning scheme proposals, the OPW and Cork County Council requested the consultants to carry out further surveys and analysis to alleviate the concerns raised at the exhibition before determination of the next steps required to take the scheme forward. Following the completion of an exhibition report, all those who had made submissions were responded to and this resulted in further issues being raised by affected members of the public which had to be dealt with. This level of detailed engagement and consultation with the public is a time-consuming process and adds to the time taken to progress the development of the scheme design. It is, however, a very important part of the process and will ultimately lead to a better and more effective scheme for the people of Skibbereen. With the assistance of its consultants on the scheme, Cork County Council commenced a procurement process for a civil works contractor to undertake the scheme works earlier this year with a view to having a contractor appointed towards the end of 2014. However, the procurement process has taken longer than anticipated for various reasons and is still ongoing, with the result that the council will not now be in a position to appoint a contractor in 2014. The council expects to be in a position to appoint a contractor early in 2015 with construction expected to take approximately 18 months. I understand the frustration that people feel at the length of time it has taken to bring the Skibbereen scheme to construction. I also understand the very real difficulties they have. I will touch on the insurance issue in my supplementary response, but I assure the Deputy that this is a priority for me. The funding is ring-fenced and the scheme will be delivered. I expect significant progress in early 2015.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	403	I thank the Minister of State for his personal interest in the scheme and his detailed reply. I contacted the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform within the last two weeks, having met the local committee behind the campaign on this very important work. The Minister of State said himself in his reply that detailed design for the scheme was commenced by consultants following the completion of the public exhibition and he indicated that this was practically completed. What is involved here is the Minister of State's Department, Cork County Council and the consultants. The report is almost complete and will go to the local authority and then the Department. Can we expedite that process with all due haste? We are heading into the Christmas period and anything that is not worked out before the holidays will inevitably be deferred until January. Can we make absolutely sure that we get the report to the local authority and the Department? I would be very grateful if the process were led at departmental level. The Minister of State will be in Clonakilty on 15 December and we always welcome that type of proactive approach by Ministers and Ministers of State in coming to an area to see schemes first-hand. It is a very important part of our democracy and I acknowledge it in that context. I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would also do two other things that day.I ask him to meet members of the Skibbereen flood committee and, if his diary allows, to travel to Skibbereen as his predecessor, the former Minister of State, Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, did at the start of the year. On that occasion, the then Minister of State gave a commitment in good faith which, for reasons beyond his control, was not realised within the stated timeframe. Having met those affected, I know how important this flood relief work is to them. I urge the Minister of State to look favourably on my two requests and thank him in advance for considering them. I ask that the design be provided forthwith and that he use his visit to the area on 15 December to meet members of the Skibbereen flood committee and, if possible, visit the town. It would be an ideal opportunity to do so.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	404	I will look favourably on both of the Deputy's requests. He can take as a given that I will do everything I can to ensure the report is delivered with haste. I share his frustration and that of people in Skibbereen. The Government wants this flood relief scheme to be delivered and has provided funding to that end. People in Skibbereen now expect it to be delivered, having invested considerable time in providing valuable information that will ensure we will have the best and most effective scheme possible. I will be delighted to visit Skibbereen and meet people in the town. While I cannot give the Deputy a guarantee that I will be able to do so on 15 December, I guarantee that I will do so in the coming weeks. I will arrange with the Deputy and other Members to meet a delegation from Skibbereen, either in Leinster House or Skibbereen. It would be useful for everyone to come together to make a collective push to get the scheme over the line.  The Deputy also raised the issue of insurance, which is a source of concern for people in Skibbereen and elsewhere. As he noted, my predecessor, the former Minister of State, Mr. Brian Hayes, did a great deal of work in agreeing a memorandum of understanding with the insurance industry. It involves the Office of Public Works sharing with the insurance industry details of the flood relief programme. In return, we expect the industry to factor this information into its commercial decisions. Following publication of the CFRAM programme, we may end up spending €1 billion on flood relief works over two decades. We cannot have the taxpayer spending more than €40 million per annum on flood relief schemes while people are left without insurance. I met representatives of Insurance Ireland today and expect to receive an update in the next week or thereabouts showing what the organisation has done with the information it received under the memorandum of understanding and how many people have been provided with insurance as a result of flood relief schemes. I hope and expect that once the scheme has been delivered in Skibbereen, Insurance Ireland and the insurance industry in general will live up to their side of the bargain. This will require the industry to factor information provided by the OPW into its commercial decisions in a favourable manner. Insurance cover is a great worry for people and addressing the issue is one of my priorities.  I again thank the Deputy for raising the issue and reiterate my commitment to Skibbereen.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	405	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for discussion. I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and thank him for coming to the House to participate in this debate. I submitted this topic for discussion on a number of occasions last week and decided to try one more time before I left the House last Friday. Little did I know then that by the time the issue had been selected for debate, Mr. Jonathan Corrie would have died not 50 m from Leinster House. May he rest in peace.  I am aware that the issue of homelessness is complex and that one must factor in issues such as alcoholism, drug abuse, mental illness and the breakdown of relationships. The Oireachtas and the Government cannot wash their hands of the issue or leave it to those who work daily to solve the problem. I have in mind organisations such as the Simon Community, Focus Ireland and Inner City Helping Homeless. Emergency accommodation must be provided as a short-term solution. I welcome the initiative announced by the Minister today to invite a number of stakeholders to attend an emergency forum on homelessness. The figure indicating that 168 people are homeless in Dublin may be the tip of the iceberg as more people slip into homelessness every day. There are also many layers of homelessness and many reasons for it. I am aware of homeless people who travel many miles to Clondalkin every day to keep their children in education. We can only imagine the additional distress this causes.  Short-term emergency solutions are needed. The problem, as the Taoiseach and the Minister noted in statements today, can only be solved by implementing long-term solutions. For this reason, I welcome the Minister's initiative and the ten actions announced by the Government which include the refurbishment of vacant units, the provision of increased funding for housing and emergency beds, as well as the housing first service and other initiatives. This approach provides a way forward in the long term. However, we must also ensure an emergency programme is introduced to solve the problem for those who are sleeping on the streets before Christmas.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	406	Since the Government took office, we have had a major housing crisis. I extend my sympathy to the family and friends of Mr. Jonathan Corrie who died only a stone's throw from Leinster House. I hope his death has finally kicked the Government into action. The Government's recent proposals on housing placed little emphasis on the emergency housing crisis. It is clear that the increase in homelessness has been caused by people losing their homes as a result of rent increases. The caps applied to the rent supplement and rental accommodation schemes are being breached by landlords. Families in emergency accommodation are spending lengthy periods in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and hostels which were intended to provide a temporary solution. The long-term answer to the problem is to deliver more social housing. What we need is a plan to enable people to access places immediately. Rent controls which the Government has resisted are necessary to stop the haemorrhaging of people from the rent supplement and rental accommodation schemes into homelessness. Figures show that 45 families were made homeless in the past month and that 168 people were recorded as sleeping rough on one night in Dublin alone. Every night 2,580 adults and 798 children are housed in emergency accommodation. We do not know the true figure because some people are living in cars, sleeping on sofas in other people's homes or finding other places to sleep. We do not know anything about these people.  State properties and properties owned by the National Asset Management Agency, abandoned buildings and other innovative options should be utilised. I have been on the soup run on which I have seen appalling sights. Furthermore, families housed in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation do not have cooking facilities or amenities and their children do not have anywhere to go. They are isolated from their extended families and children must travel across the city to attend school.  Government statements suggesting it will end long-term homelessness in 2016 are farcical considering the scale of the problem, as is the claim that it will end waiting lists by 2020. According to the Taoiseach, officials and representatives of the housing agencies and local authorities will meet next Thursday. A series of constructive steps are needed, not a talking shop. The Government was quick to allocate €700 million from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to Irish Water. It should consider this option as a means of securing more funding to deal with the issue of homelessness.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	407	The tragic death of Mr. Jonathan Corrie is an unspeakable event for his family, friends and loved ones. It is also a source of immense shame for the State, the political system and the Government. We cannot allow tragedies such as Mr. Corrie's death to continue. Emergency measures are needed to deal with what has become a national emergency. Talk of long-term solutions and spending billions of euro by 2020 is all very well, but we need an emergency response now. Incidentally, the House has not had an opportunity to properly scrutinise the Government's housing proposals, about which many questions remain unanswered. I will make two simple proposals which have been made on numerous occasions, both by the homeless agencies and, since 2011, Deputies in this House. First, suitable empty buildings must be requisitioned in every local authority area and quickly refurbished to provide accommodation for the homeless.In my area there are two buildings owned by the local authority, one of which has been earmarked for homeless accommodation for several years and another of which is an empty building in which dozens of families or people could live. They are sitting there empty. The local authority should be given the money to refurbish them and get people off the streets. We need a telephone call from the Minister for Social Protection to community welfare officers around the country telling them one simple thing, namely, that if a person cannot find accommodation under the rent caps but can find it at €1,100, €1,200 or €1,300, it will be approved. It is not about raising the general level of the caps; rather, it is about nobody being turned away. All a community welfare officer has to do to confirm the legitimacy of such a claim is to go onto www.daft.ie on the same day and check if it is a reasonable request. I know of a woman who was made homeless three months ago because of the rent caps. She has found somewhere that is cheaper but is still not within the rent caps. She was led to believe by the Minister for Social Protection that there would be flexibility from the community welfare officer. This weekend she, along with her two children, is facing homelessness again because the community welfare officer will not sanction a breach of the cap. She will be homeless unless those telephone calls are made. I appeal for a phone call to be made to the Department of Social Protection to say nobody will be forced into homelessness because of the rent caps.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	408	What happened outside Leinster House on Monday morning was a tragedy for the whole country and, in particular, the Government. I would like to extend my sincere condolences to Jonathan, his family and his friends. The best thing we can do is to do something about the situation he faced on the streets night after night. When one contrasts what happened yesterday with the fact that NAMA, the largest state-owned property company in the world, is sitting on property, we can only ask why this happened. The Minister has called a summit on Thursday. Will he invite the CEO of NAMA to the meeting to ask him exactly what properties are vacant and how they can be utilised? Can we establish how many suitable properties which could be used to solve the issue of rough sleeping as part of the emergency resolution are held in the city by NAMA? It cannot be impossible to deal immediately with the estimated 170 people who are sleeping rough in the city. As Father Peter McVerry said, such people are the ones people can see. It is the ones who are hiding and trying to protect themselves who should also be added to the list. There could be another 40 or 50 people sleeping rough.  The Archbishop of Dublin has said he has been invited to the summit. Can he be asked why 90 completed housing units at Father Scully House, built with 100% funding from the State and the city council and run by the Catholic Housing Aid Society, are lying idle because of the rent demands from that institution?  We see the same thing happening every year. We respond to the crisis, but we now need to put in place something that can deal with the crisis in the future. There should be a temporary three-year rent cap to deal with the crisis in the building of social housing, a rent supplement increase for those in immediate need and a longer-term plan to bring on board properties which will provide suitable accommodation, rather than the squalor I have seen in wet hostels, in which people can feel comfortable and secure. Many people will not stay in hostels because they are insecure, their belongings are stolen and the situation is chaotic.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	409	I also express my condolences to the family of Jonathan Corrie, my solidarity with all of those who face the human tragedy of homelessness and my support for those who are currently holding a vigil to highlight this issue. There has been an explosion in homelessness. There has always been homelessness in our society, but it has multiplied massively over the past year. Focus Ireland said it would normally deal with about eight families a month; last month it dealt with 45. All of those cases involve individual human tragedies. Every person who contacts me in a housing crisis has a horrific tale about the experience of ending up in that situation and trying to get out of it. We have seen cases such as that of Shane and Ciara Dwyer, who were living in their car in Jobstown, Fiona O'Connor, who has to leave her house by Christmas Day, and Helen Lynch, who has been homeless for the best part of a year and has to find permanent accommodation in order for her son to get on a transplant list. Every single one of the numbers has a human case underneath it. We cannot wash our hands of the situation and say it is a tragedy and some unexplained natural disaster. It is a tragedy which is a result of Government policy. It is obviously not the intention of the Government for this to happen to anybody, but it flows from Government policy. Father Peter McVerry put his finger on it earlier today when he said:Unfortunately cattle and sheep are more important to our economy than homeless people. We have a homeless crisis which is not being addressed.That is the reality. The long-term solution, including rent caps, rent controls and the building of significant amounts of social housing, and the short-term need to provide emergency homeless accommodation are not being addressed. NAMA owns 12% of all the hotels in the State. Homeless people are living in very difficult emergency accommodation where there are curfews and security personnel end up in their homes without forewarning. People who are in desperate situations are treated as prisoners. We need to refurbish the hotels and allow people to stay in them while homes are being built.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	410	The death of Jonathan Corrie is shocking but not surprising. I thought Rory Hearne of Maynooth University put it well when he said recently:When our financial system was in peril there was no obstacle too large for our political establishment and the state to overcome. Now we face an equivalent crisis in terms of the fundamental housing needs and rights of hundreds of thousands of our citizens. It is legitimate to ask why the same radical approach that determinedly did 'whatever was needed to be done' is not applied to the housing crisis. It appears it is because the government is unwilling to stand up to the financial and property investors and transform the residential property market into a system to meet housing needs.Rent supplements were capped but rents were not, and never the twain shall meet. The system does not work. We were told NAMA was to have a mandate to contribute to the social and economic development of the State, but that has not happened. It has not contributed to the public good, despite the significant potential it had to do so. In fact, the manner in which it has sold assets to large investment bodies, particularly real estate investment trusts, has significantly worsened the housing crisis. I know of a development in which apartments were sold for less than half of what it would cost to build them today, and where rent two years ago for a two-bedroom apartment was €1,000 per month, which has increased to €1,200 or €1,250. Tenants have been told their rent will increase to €1,400 a month.  In its so-called housing strategy the Government told us that 75,000 of the people in need will be at the mercy of the private rental market. If it allows that, and does not control and monitor the private rental market, we will have the same fiasco. It will not work.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	411	I thank all Deputies for their contributions. I do not doubt their sincerity in trying to find solutions to this very complex issue. I too want to offer my condolences to the family and friends of Jonathan Corrie. It is quite shocking that he died so close to where we operate every day in trying to solve these issues. I do not want to turn this into a political shouting match because that would not be appropriate. This is a political Chamber, but there are some topics for which we need to find solutions without dropping down to political point-scoring. The reasons many people are homeless are complex, and sometimes the solutions have to be. If there were an easy solution to deal with every individual who is homeless, I would have made sure it happened. There is no best practice for homelessness. I have taken a number of actions as Minister and have prioritised this issue. Meetings about social housing and, in particular, homelessness, take place with Dublin City Council at 9 a.m. every Monday. A Cabinet sub-committee meets to discuss this issue on a regular basis. Many fairly positive actions have been taken.For instance, in the next few months another 655 voids - social housing units that have been closed up - will be opened. This alone could provide enough units for people homeless in this city. It is scandalous these units have been left void as they are the quickest way to turn around the situation in this city. I prioritised the return to use of these units immediately I took on this role. I have changed the allocation policy in regard to homelessness. For instance, I have told local authorities in Dublin that 25% of allocations should be based on the homeless. I have increased the budget by 20%, bringing it to over €55 million, the highest ever. Just 12 or 14 days ago, I provided a further €4 million to Dublin City Council for homelessness, despite the fact that the council rejected a proposal to increase the budget for homelessness. We are all aware supply is the critical issue and we must ensure we have a greater supply for the future. Hence the policy announced last week and the €3.8 billion to provide for the new strategy in the medium and long term. We have also announced the Housing First service, which is being provided through Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust and will provide support for the homeless and those with specific needs. Some 164 more emergency beds will be supplied in the coming weeks, bringing supply to in excess of 1,500 beds. I would like to see the intervention mechanism run in Dublin by Threshold rolled out further. It concerns itself with people in vulnerable situations who might be about to become homeless and intervenes and negotiates on their behalf, via the local authority and landlords etc. It has dealt successfully with more than 200 cases in recent months. I would like to see this rolled out throughout the country because the intervention tactic works well. In more than 90% of these cases, the rent supplement has been increased. This initiative was targeted, but we need to become more involved in intervention. There is a plan in place to deal with homelessness and this plan was in place long before the social housing strategy was announced last week. I have announced a coming together on Thursday of the key players to discuss how we can maximise everything that is being done. I am not convinced it is all about funding, but if there is a requirement for funding, I will go to Cabinet and demand more funding. The processes are at play here. We need a greater coming together of everyone working on this issue - the Department, the Government, local authorities, the NGOs and other organisations - to ensure people do not fall between stools and to ensure we intervene where necessary.  It is not just an issue of providing accommodation. If that was all it was about, I am confident we could do that. There are solutions to provision through NAMA and other sources, but the issue is more complex. Each individual circumstance is different. It is about providing complex solutions that work and initiating a process that will ensure they always work. There must be continual interception in order that people are not made homeless one night, then we intervene, but one week later they are homeless again. A complex solution is required. The actions we have taken are good, but the issue now is that we must work closely with the NGOs and other agencies to ensure that all of the processes intercept those who are vulnerable to the maximum possible. That is the ambition behind our planned meeting on Thursday. I have meetings every week on the issue of homelessness. Officials from the Department meet officials from Dublin City Council and local authorities every Monday morning at 9 o'clock on the issue of homelessness. This is not about another strategy or plan. It is about taking direct and immediate action to help those whom everyone in this House agrees we should help.

It is clear from his contribution that there is no simple solution and this issue cannot be resolved by the stroke of a pen. It is a complex situation and I wish the Minister well in dealing with it. We will be watching vigilantly given what has happened and I wish him well with the work.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	413	The Minister says the issue is complex and is not all about resources. I am sorry, but it is substantially about resources. Take, for example, the case of Ann Heffernan, the woman I have talked about. Having been made homeless several months ago because the rent for the accommodation she was in went up to €1,300, she went to the community welfare officer, but the officer would not sanction a rise in the cap and she was made homeless as a result. She then went looking for somewhere else to stay and managed to find a place for €1,200, but when she went to the community officer and asked if he would would sanction €1,200, the community welfare officer said sorry, but the cap was €975. She then got on to Threshold, but it cannot get the officer to raise the cap. She will be homeless next week unless a telephone call goes to the community welfare officer asking him to raise the cap. This situation is happening all over the city. We cannot have excuses and bureaucracy and talk of complexity covering this reality.

I want to see the community welfare officer being phoned and told to raise the cap to realistic levels.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	416	The Minister did not answer two of the questions I put. Will NAMA be part of that discussion on Thursday? It should be, because it is the biggest property owner almost in the world. In regard to Fr. Scully House, why are those 90 units not handed over immediately?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	417	Sorry, I meant to answer that.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	418	These units could deal immediately with those who are homeless currently. There are 1,400 families in emergency accommodation, 168 people or more in Dublin city alone. Whatever we can do in Dublin must be done around the country where similar supports are needed. The Minister was correct in saying that 248 homeless people from the homeless list were provided with long-term accommodation, but the numbers of homeless are rising. Once people cannot pay the rents demanded by rack-renting landlords, we will see more people on the streets. This must be stopped. The only way this can be stopped is to put a cap on rents. There must be rent control and the rent supplement must be raised. In addition, decent accommodation must be made available. I talk to a homeless man on Marlborough Street regularly. He says he will not go near the hostels because his stuff would be robbed and there are too many problems and there is too much chaos in them. The accommodation being provided must and should be of good quality.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	419	I do not deny that homelessness is a complex and complicated issue, but the Government should not be allowed hide behind that. Much of the homelessness facing us right now is not that complicated. According to Peter McVerry, a majority of those who are homeless currently - this is substantiated by my empirical experience - are homeless simply because rents have risen out of control and they cannot afford to pay them. These are not just single people who are unemployed. Some are couples, one who is working and one who is unemployed. They are homeless because rents are out of control, particularly in this city. The simple solution to this is to increase the caps immediately, impose rent controls and, over time, build homes. There is also a simple enough solution to the dire circumstances of people in emergency accommodation. Dublin City Council paid €2.4 million last year to private hotels and other commercial entities for emergency accommodation at a time when NAMA is sitting on hotel properties that could quite easily be adapted and made accessible for homeless people.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	420	Nobody doubts that this is a serious challenge, but for a number of years most Government action, of this and the previous Government, was geared by a neo-liberal ideology. That is part of this scene. When the Minister said he was introducing a housing strategy, I thought we would get a real housing strategy, but what he has given us is a budget plan. What has he done about rent control? In Germany, rent is linked to inflation. Here it seems it is linked to the sky. Rent has gone up 30% in two years. The Government seems prepared to walk away from interference in the private market. What is the Minister doing about quality social housing and about where it is being built? Half of the young people looking for housing in Ireland in the next ten years will be looking for social housing, because they will not be able to afford to buy homes. The buying of homes by young people will be a thing of the past.What are we doing about land banking and about developer-led planning? What are we going to do about ghettoisation? These are all issues I thought were going to be part of the Government's housing strategy. The Minister can talk all he likes but the Government is not dealing in a holistic manner with the challenges of housing in Ireland.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	421	I thank Deputy Wallace. That was an amazing contribution from him. We all have responsibilities in this House. We all have responsibilities towards everyone we deal with, and so does Deputy Wallace. We all have responsibilities to ensure we do our utmost to make sure people do not get into poverty and are not left in difficult situations. It is imperative we all do that. I certainly will not be hiding behind anything. I am going to hide behind budgets or anything else in regard to an issue like this; it is far more serious than that. I have said already in the House, in committee and previously that if it is a question of looking for budgets, I will get budgets, but it is broader than that. It is a very complex issue. If the processes are not working, people will slip through the cracks no matter how much we put into this. That is a fact, and I know all of the Deputies have accepted it to some degree. I have no issue whatsoever with NAMA coming in. It has supplied a serious number of units for social housing and there is a plan to supply thousands more, so there is no issue there. I am more interested in Deputy Joan Collins's second point on Fr. Scully House. I agree with the Deputy. Perhaps I should have been more vocal on this earlier but this cannot go on. We have a situation where 99 units are not in play. This is not in my control, as the House will appreciate, as it is a private organisation. I will be asking Archbishop Diarmuid Martin about this but I understand he has made comments previously that he does not have any role, so I will have to tease this out. By all accounts, the name as opposed to the orientation is the Catholic Housing Aid Society, but whatever role Archbishop Martin can have, I would welcome any help. The idea of a situation continuing where 99 units - fine units, by all accounts - are left standing idle is not acceptable and cannot continue. There may be other cases where work is taking place with other groups and there are similar issues. I want to see solutions brought about that will intercept people who are in vulnerable situations. I have spoken previously about budgets but I absolutely believe that, collectively, there is a need for processes to be put in place to co-ordinate what we, the local authorities, all of the NGOs, State agencies like the HSE and others involved in addiction counselling are doing. It must cover everything. All of this needs a protocol that works clearly. My orientation on Thursday will be to deal with that in an intense way to put in place processes that will work. If it requires more funding, I will go to Government looking for that and I will get that, but it is not, I believe, confined to that issue. I need everyone to come to the table, to leave their organisational brand outside as regards what they want for themselves, to think collectively, as a society, working together in that room on how we are going to deal with this issue, because society let down Jonathan.

I referred to these on Second Stage and a briefing on these specific amendments was provided to Deputies on Committee Stage. I am happy to facilitate these on the basis that they deal with a number of technical issues that emerged during the implementation of this Act. In effect, there are two separate sets of amendments being introduced today. The first relates to section 28B(2)(b) and the process around the notification to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources of a merger. As it stands, the Act allows parties to notify the Minister immediately after they have notified the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC. However, while the Act gives the Minister 30 days from the end of the CCPC process or European Commission process - whichever applies - to complete his or her initial examination, the Act also currently allows, under section 28D(9), for the Minister to effectively stop the clock on the process while he or she waits on further information from parties. However, the ability of the Minister to do this is contingent at present on the date of notification rather than the end of the CCPC or European Commission process. This means the situation could theoretically arise that the Minister could lose the ability to request further information while suspending the time limits, given that he or she cannot actually commence examination of the merger until after the end of the previous part of the process. This amendment, to section 28B(2)(b), clarifies that notification can now only occur after the end of the CCPC or European Commission processes, thus removing the possibility that the Minister might be deprived of the ability to require further information of parties with the appropriate protections. There is also an amendment to section 22(4B), as inserted by section 59 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, which ensures that in circumstances where parties submit proposals to the CCPC, the later timelines and the process are unaffected. Importantly, this amendment has no effect on the length of the process that parties must go through. It merely ensures that the process remains robust and coherent throughout. The second set relates to a single amendment to section 28E(13)(b), and corrects a reference to a subsection, from subsection (8) to subsection (7). This is a drafting error in the text and this change ensures that the phase 1 and phase 2 assessment can operate in the same manner.

We will be supporting the amendments as it is important any issues around the legislation be amended as quickly as possible. I would like to comment on the role of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in the recent beef dispute as I do not believe it covered itself in glory. We had an issue where farmers were looking for a fair price and for fair treatment from those whom they supplied, and the only action of the commission was to go after the farmers and not particularly to go after the big conglomerates that were causing the dispute. As its first outing in terms of public persona and public presence, I do not believe it covered itself in glory. This agency needs to develop a reputation for standing by the consumer and for standing by the small producers who do not have the power and the might of the big conglomerates. On this occasion, it did not do that. It is not a good start and I hope it is not a method by which it means to continue. I support the legislation. I again thank the Minister of State and his officials for the clarifications given.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	425	This is the second time in recent weeks that Ministers have sought to piggyback amendments to enacted legislation. What makes this more worrying is that the legislation the Minister of State seeks to amend here only passed the Dáil and Seanad a few short months ago, in effect. Specifically on the amendments, one of the major questions is when the Minister Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will use his ministerial powers. The guidelines on media mergers have not yet been published. It is disappointing that the Minister believes it is appropriate to slip in amendments to the competition and consumer protection legislation in this manner. If the legislation is to be revisited, the debate should have begun at the start of the Bill's journey. I, for one, would have welcomed an opportunity to amend it in some key areas.  Section 19 of the legislation prescribes those organisations with which the new body will work. It does not, however, mention Irish Water. For hundreds of thousands of families across the State, Irish Water is toxic. Some are opposed to the commodification of water for logical reasons. Water is necessary for life and to commodify it puts a cost on one of the key inputs. Others are opposed to it because they simply cannot afford to meet another cost, charge and stealth tax. Regardless of the reasons people are opposed to water charges, they are united in their disgust at the manner in which Irish Water has conducted itself. The Government may believe it is going to pull it back from the brink, but, to be honest, nobody outside the House really believes that.  The Minister told us earlier this year that the Government had established a new governance model to manage, fund and deliver water services. We asked him who would independently stand up for the consumer in this reform process. He told us that the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, would be the independent regulator for Irish Water and that it would have powers to direct the company to prepare a code of practice on any matter that it considered necessary and appropriate to secure the interests of customers. We warned that the CER was a regulator, not a consumer watchdog with real teeth to protect and vindicate consumer rights. We raised a number of other concerns with the Minister and, in a manner true to form, the Government did not listen. Not listening is becoming the modus operandi of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government. It is business as usual; the Government is literally carrying on the baton from the previous Government, with the same arrogance playing itself out. There is a disconnect on the part of the Government in dealing with the issue of water charges and how to address the antiquated water infrastructure in the State. The Government hides behind EUROSTAT figures, as if the construction of the company is something over which it has no control. The EUROSTAT figures are simply a method used by the European Union to force important utilities such as this to be separated from the state. The Government is obviously flying by the seat of its pants and its governing is becoming more chaotic day by day.  We also sought to amend the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill to address a deeply unjust ruling in 2004 by the Competition Authority on rates of pay for vulnerable workers in journalism and the entertainment industry. SIPTU and Equity had a collective agreement with the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland setting out minimum rates of pay, overtime rates and rest breaks for voice-over actors. In 2004 the Competition Authority ruled that this agreement was in breach of section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 as each actor was, in effect, a business. In real terms, this is nonsense. The authority deemed it unlawful for musicians, actors and journalists to have a right to collective representation by their unions. Further down the road SIPTU and the NUJ secured an agreement via the social partnership process on a legislative change to deal with this deeply unfair decision. However, the commitment was not delivered on by Fianna Fáil and the unions have had even less success with the Labour Party and Fine Gael - so much for the so-called Labour Party softening the hard edges of its right-wing coalition partner. In 2012 ICTU wrote to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation seeking an exemption from the provisions of the Competition Act. In 2013 the Minister's officials told the unions that the troika was blocking the Government in exempting these workers from the provisions of competition legislation.

As I stated, the proposition that the troika was in some way micro-managing the industrial relations environment in the State was laughable, but that is what the senior Minister in the Minister of State's Department stated about the reason Fine Gael had refused to enact a pledge it had made prior to going into government. The Competition Authority's judgment was wrong and today the Government had an opportunity to make things right. I fear that the bottom line is that the Labour Party's influence in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is nowhere to be found. The Labour Party has failed to provide fundamental industrial relations rights for freelance journalists, photographers and voice-over actors whose opportunities and rates of pay have fallen significantly in the past few years. When the Minister approaches legislation such as this, I appeal for us to go back and make sure it goes through the Dáil in the normal manner to afford all Members of the Oireachtas an opportunity to have an input into its development simply to ensure members of the public - the people affected by the legislation - would have an opportunity to have their representatives speak on their behalf.

I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak to the motion which deals specifically with the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014. I welcome this debate as the entire sector to which we are referring is vital to the economic future of the country and also because the huge talent in the sector is often ignored by wider society. It is also important to say that when we address the words "intellectual property", we need to focus on the need for high standards and outside independent assessment, as in the case of the row about the junior certificate examinations. Students and graduates have high standards because they came through a second level education system in which they were assessed independently and professionally and that had their trust and that of parents. International companies come to Ireland because of our excellent workforce. It is important to say this in this debate in which we are talking about intellectual property. We have many high quality, skilled individuals in the State who are making a massive contribution. It is also important to emphasise our quality workforce as we often get carried away with the tax issues relating to international companies. The Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 will amend existing patent law in order to extend a research exemption to the developers of innovative medicinal and veterinary medicinal products. The Bill will also make changes to the current trademark law to make it compatible with the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks.  In my introductory remarks on the Bill I also mentioned the importance of the pharmaceutical sector and the fact that we had highly qualified graduates. These are excellent young people who are delivering quality services. We all know that the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland has been transformed in recent decades, since the 1960s.In fairness to the IDA and the people who work in this sector, they went around the world to target the fine chemicals industry. They brought a number of multinationals to Ireland and today Ireland is the eighth largest pharmaceuticals producer in the world, with nine of the world's top ten pharmaceutical companies locating substantial operations here. The pharmaceutical sector makes an important contribution to the Irish economy. It accounts for approximately one quarter of total Irish exports and it is a significant employer. The IDA estimates that 24,500 people are directly employed in the sector, with a further 24,000 people indirectly employed in support services. In the region of 120 pharmaceutical companies are located in Ireland. This is why I support the legislation. It is important to play to our strengths, particularly when we are trying to exit a recession. I know many of the people working in the sector, whether directly or indirectly, from my constituency of Dublin Bay North, in areas like Marino, Artane, Coolock, Clontarf, Howth and Killester. The legislation gives legal certainty to the research exemption in Ireland and introduces a more liberal exemption than is currently provided. This legal certainty should reassure developers of innovative medicinal and veterinary products that Ireland remains a good place to conduct pharmaceutical business. That is a key element of the legislation. It also makes changes to Irish trade mark law, but these are not related to the research exemption. It may not be politically correct to raise a different issue pertaining to intellectual property but it is worth warning the Government about it because the State could face costs of hundreds of millions of euro if we do not watch what is going on in the broader sector. I refer to the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014. In early 2014, the new EU tobacco product directive, TPD, was adopted. It included a ban on the sale of packs of ten cigarettes and methanol cigarettes, and mandatory 65% health warnings. After the European Parliament specifically voted against including plain packaging in the new TPD, the Commission decided to revisit the issue in five years' time. Ireland took a different view, however, and the Government proceeded with reform. Questions arise about the legality of this approach in regard to the deprivation of intellectual property, breaches of existing WTO agreements and whether it would lead to similar legislation for other products, such as alcohol. It is also questionable whether plain packaging actually works. I raise these questions because a number of documents circulating in the European Commission suggest that plain packaging was abandoned because of serious concerns among stakeholders. A more balanced approach has been chosen as a result and the Commission plans to review the issue after five years. Our Minister for Health takes a different view. By rushing to become the first country in Europe to adopt plain packaging, Ireland is set to make itself a guinea pig for lawsuits brought by tobacco companies. Is it not a more prudent course of action to let the UK or France, both of which have greater resources, to introduce plain packaging and defend any subsequent legal challenges before Ireland introduces its own measures? I may be a lone voice in this House but similar concerns have been raised by nine EU member states, namely, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain, in detailed opinions submitted to the Commission under the TRIS notification procedures. Should these opinions not be shared with the Oireachtas before it is asked to vote on the legislation? I raise this issue in the context of our debate on intellectual property because I do not want us to face the prospect of a massive legal bill in several years time. We cannot afford it and we should not hammer the taxpayers of this country once again. I advise the Government to keep its eye on this ball because one never knows what is going to happen. The Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 amends existing patent law to extend the current research exemption to developers of medicinal and veterinary products. It amends section 42 of the Patents Act 1992 to expand the research exemption provision to include all studies, tests, experiments, clinical and field trials and the consequential practical requirements for obtaining marketing authorisation for new and generic products. The exemption will apply to tests carried out in Ireland or any state in the European Economic Area. The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs tasked the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a review of section 42 of the 1992 Act with the aim of clarifying research actions that do not constitute patent infringement under Irish law in order to maintain and attract high value-added bio-pharmaceutical investment. The research or Bolar exemption is an exemption to the rights conferred by patents. This is particularly important for manufacturers of medicinal products. It will also allow manufacturers to prepare generic drugs prior to expiry of a patent. Manufacturers of medicinal products must get regulatory approval that the products are safe and effective before they can be marketed or sold. This is very important in the context of international health. We have seen many mistakes in the past in respect of drugs like thalidomide. Product safety will be ascertained through clinical studies, tests and trials. Producers of generic medicines will be able to use the original manufacturer's regulatory approval if they can demonstrate that the generic version is bio-equivalent to the approved medicine. However, the generic producer runs the risk of patent infringement if it conducts clinical trials on a patented product before the patent has expired. The Bolar exemption means these necessary trials will not amount to a patent infringement. The Bill has two distinct objectives. All EU member states require that prior to a drug being put on the market, the manufacturer must apply for marketing authorisation by submitting data that approve the safety of the product concerned. I welcome the Bill, although I would have preferred more detailed preparation, and I will be supporting it.

The guidelines are with the Minister in draft format and when they are published, a period of 30 days will be provided for consultation. We dealt with most of the issues raised by Deputy Finian McGrath on Second and Committee Stages. The reason I asked for clarification earlier was because I thought we were debating the motion to introduce additional amendments. There may be some confusion in that regard. Most of the issues the Deputy raised are important and I welcome his support on this Bill.It is a very important Bill. We have dealt with most of the concerns on the various Stages. There are some amendments that will have to be recommitted on Report Stage, but that will be dealt with shortly.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	441	I move amendment No. 1:In page 3, line 7, after “1996;” to insert “to amend the Competition Act 2002;”.This amendment relates to the Long Title of the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 and seeks to provide for amendment to the Competition Act 2002, as amended by the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014. Amendment No. 2 contains a number of technical and consequential amendments to the Competition Act 2002. Section 22(4B) of the Act, which was inserted by section 59 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, is being amended to provide for the conformity of time limits relating to the consideration of any proposals from notifying parties in the context of a final determination in respect of a merger notification. The amendment to section 28B(2)(b), inserted by section 74 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, provides that a media merger notification to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources may only happen after the determination process undertaken by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has concluded. This is to preserve the ability of the Minister to request further information from parties to a merger and to stop the clock until such time as the request is met. The opportunity is being availed of to correct an inadvertent incorrect cross-reference in section 28E(13)(b), inserted by section 74 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, while consequential amendments provide for clarification of treatment of media mergers notified during the interim period between 31 October 2014, when Part 4 of the Act came into effect, and these amendments coming into effect. Definitions of the Competition Acts are also provided for by this amendment. Amendment No. 4 incorporates a proposed amendment to the Competition Act 2002, as made by the amendment inserting a new section 4 referred to earlier, into the collective citation Competition Acts 2002 to 2014 and that they should be construed as one Act. The amendments are mainly technical.

The Patents Act 1992 is amended by the insertion of the following new section after section 61:
“Common good
61A. The achievement of the common good may require permanent or temporary interference with the rights, including intellectual property rights, of persons or corporate entities.”.”.Intellectual property rights and the rights of citizens and governments are in fine balance. Recently, the US Chamber of Commerce lodged objections with the European Commission with regard to the Government's plans to introduce plain packaging on tobacco products. There is disagreement with regard to the correct use of policy and the correct use of intellectual property rights. The US Chamber of Commerce said it was concerned that a member state would propose legislation that would, in effect, create an intra-EU trade barrier that had not previously existed and that it would set a dangerous precedent at the expense of the protection of the intellectual property rights of many other industries, not just the large tobacco industry. Not to be outdone by this, the European Commission weighed in and said our economy could be significantly damaged if we failed to safeguard intellectual property rights. When Australia decided to opt for plain packaging for tobacco products, big tobacco fought it. As a result, Philip Morris International moved its headquarters from Australia to Hong Kong, where there existed an international trade agreement. In that international trade agreement, it sought to use investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, which is part of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership process which the Government is enthusiastically and actively pursuing, to change the policy in Australia. Veolia threatened to use ISDS against Egypt in an effort to stop its policy of increasing the minimum wage, and the Egyptian Government has decreased the minimum wage as a result. My argument is that there must be occasions where the common or societal good takes precedence and that governments have the liberty to create policy for that area. In the last conversation I had with the Minister about this he did not deal with the substantive issue I raised. Not only is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation not seeking the derogation the Minister of State mentioned, he is actively seeking the inclusion of ISDS within the TTIP agreement. The amendment is an effort to ensure that the common good is centrally placed in the legislation of this State.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	444	I understand the Deputy's concerns and will try to put him at ease again, as I tried to do on Committee Stage. The patents are but one form of intellectual property rights, which term includes copyrighted trademarks, industrial designs and so forth. At national level, the various laws that govern these intellectual property rights provide saving provisions, of the type with which the Deputy is concerned, that allow the Government, if necessary, to legislate where there are public interest issues at stake. Individually, we can do that. Moreover, the Irish Constitution specifically recognises the importance of property and guarantees to pass no law to attempt to abolish the right of private ownership. However, in recognition of the principles of social justice, the Constitution provides that the State may, as occasion requires, delimit by law the exercise of such rights in the exigencies of the common good. At national, European and international level, intellectual property rights enjoy protection that is set down under well-established and respected principles. At international level, the State is party to a number of international treaties and conventions that provide for the type of common good provision about which Deputy Tóibín is concerned. In summary, whether at national, European or international level, IP protections are not of themselves absolute rights and there exist provisions to allow states to apply derogations that allow for the suspension of part of the legal obligation which can operate to restrict some rights under certain circumstances, such as in the pursuit of broader compelling public policy reasons or for greater public interest considerations. While I appreciate the intent of the amendment, I am not in a position to accept it as it would be wholly inappropriate to provide for the limitation of intellectual property on a blanket basis in a provision of the Patents Act. It is more appropriate that the status quo prevails, which allows for the delimitation of rights in certain express circumstances under the various IP legislative measures, EU instruments and international treaties and agreements to which the State is party. We believe there is ample opportunity to deal with the Deputy's concerns in that context. On Committee Stage, Deputy Tóibín voiced concern about the position of intellectual property in the context of the negotiations on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership agreement. In particular, he was exercised about the necessity for governments to have the right to legislate and to implement policy in the context of public health and welfare. It is true that there are features of the TTIP negotiations, specifically those relating to investor-state dispute settlement, that are giving rise to considerable debate and some suspicion by stakeholders on both sides of the Atlantic. However, investment protection is a common feature of trade and investment agreements between nations. The EU and US follow the same principles that guide investment and seek to ensure a level playing field for investors. These principles recognise the right of governments to regulate for legitimate public policy objectives. While the ISDS is a valid mechanism, experience of the ISDS internationally, which prompts the concerns, shows that there is much room for improvement in how the system works. This includes having safeguards against claims that are clearly unwarranted and making sure that ISDS does not serve to constrain the rights of governments to take measures for legitimate public policy reasons. The EU's negotiating mandate on TTIP includes recognition of the right of governments to take measures necessary to achieve legitimate public policy objectives, and this is a key element in TTIP.It is clear that EU member states will seek to ensure any ISDS provisions in a future agreement will present a fair and reasonable option to which investors would have recourse for legitimate reasons and that governments would not be constrained on developing public policy measures and legislating for them in the public interest. I hope this puts the Deputy's mind at ease. I have tried as best I can to show that our Constitution and laws contain the mechanisms and protections the Deputy seeks to insert on a blanket basis.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	445	TTIP is a significant challenge to the Irish economy. It is likely that Ireland will lose a significant number of jobs as a result of its introduction. It may also mean the introduction of meat that has been treated with hormones, for example, chlorinated chicken, which is illegal in this country. It may also mean a reduction of regulation on food, workers' rights and safety. In Europe, 1,300 products are forbidden in the production of makeup, whereas in the US, 12 products are forbidden. In general, Europe has good regulation, which creates a competitive disadvantage, and therein lies the opportunity for cheaper imports to come in and jobs to migrate as a result. France and Germany have indicated that they are against the ISDS, and I am amazed the Government is still pursuing a situation in which an arbitration mechanism which is not transparent or independent would have the right to arbitrate on a policy. The amendment I seek does not provide for a blanket limitation on intellectual property rights but seeks a permanent or temporary interference where it is in the common good. The Government has already accepted in principle that corporations have the balance of rights on it. A letter I received from the Minister was telling. He indicated to me that he sought the highest liberalisation and protection of investors possible through the TTIP process. Surely, the highest liberalisation of regulation and protection of investors is half the reason this country is on the ground.

There is much discussion about TTIP and many concerns, some genuine and some misconstrued. I would have no problem having greater public discussion about TTIP. In recent months, I attended some events. Given that very few of us attended them, there has not been enough public discussion about it. There are genuine concerns and there are always winners and losers in trade negotiations; that is why they are negotiated. They are a long way from being finished. All the Deputy’s valid concerns should be teased out and discussed. If the committee wants to hold a debate on it, I would be happy to participate and we could go through all these issues individually. We should discuss this more publicly. The Department held an event in Dublin Castle and invited a number of people, who raised genuine concerns and asked questions. I would have preferred to have seen a larger crowd and much more involvement. If Members want to have a full discussion about it on Committee Stage or some other Stage, or in the Dáil, if time permits, we should do it. It would be healthy. Let us tease out all the issues. However, these amendments are not required because the protection already exists in the Constitution, in laws and in other European agreements. We are not prepared to accept the amendments, which would involve an unnecessary blanket change.

While they caused concern, it was an opportunity for others to say a few words that they missed before. This is part of the nature of democracy. It was an opportunity to clarify that the amendments were only technical and nothing about which to be concerned. While I accept that Deputy Tóibín’s amendments were genuine, they were not needed. However, we should have a discussion on TTIP, and a committee meeting would be a good way to do so, and to engage on many of the other issues the Deputy raised. The changes to intellectual property legislation before the Dáil are modest but significant. They form part of the incremental improvements required to ensure our legislation remains supportive of the kind of high-value and high-tech investment the economy needs to enhance competitiveness and grow employment. We had a very useful event at an innovation showcase. Many of the committee members were invited but could not avail of the opportunity to turn up. It was a good showcase of innovation and how important it is that we get our legislation on it right. Much is happening in the sector. Deputy Finian McGrath referred to many issues to which other Members referred on Second Stage. We recognise that there is much potential for job creation in this area and successive Governments have put a lot of money into research, innovation and development, and we want to build on it. Part of this is having our intellectual property legislation in order so we can compete with other countries. I thank the Members for facilitating the Bill.

As always, his officials were helpful and completely on top of their game. The legislation is important. As the Minister said, we must make innovation more real. While we have spent enormous amounts of money and made enormous investments, we must translate it into jobs, into something that means something to people on the ground. Tomorrow, Deputy Eoghan Murphy will host a session on coding. I gather the Taoiseach did some coding last week, although listening to his responses to questions here recently, one would have to do a lot of coding to find the answer. He did some real coding. Coding is very important and needs to be brought into the primary school curriculum. The Minister of State's other Department is the Department of Education and Skills, and that is why his fit is so important, to make such changes happen. The groundwork for investment in innovation was made by my colleague, Deputy Martin both when he was Minister for Education and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The foundation stones he put in place are the cause of where we are today. Unless we convert that investment into jobs, it will lose its reach and impact. This legislation is a small but important step in making it real.

Last time, I finished talking about section 7 of the Bill which refers to investigations of matters related to the Garda Commissioner by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. Deputy Wallace noted that it would be a very rare and serious event if the Garda Commissioner were to be investigated. I said that if it were to happen, I would expect that the Garda Commissioner of the day would step aside during the investigation.It might be useful to include that in the legislation. Section 7(3) states, "If the Minister refuses to consent to an investigation by the Ombudsman Commission of any matter under subsection (1), he or she shall inform the Commission of his or her reasons for the refusal." It would be a rare event that would lead a Minister to refuse the commission an investigation or else the Garda Ombudsman Commission would be investigating something that would be seen to be trivial. These are extraordinarily serious matters. What happens if the Minister refuses? Does the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, stand down having made that type of mistake? Should we insert in the legislation that it should go beyond the Minister and that the Cabinet should issue such a refusal because we are talking about very serious issues? The legislation states that in such an event the Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct. There is scope for tightening up that section and treating it much more seriously than it is currently being treated. Reading this Act I was going back and forth to the Principal Act and other Acts. When we are dealing with such legislation, particularly legislation updating an area that was consolidated, so to speak, in 2005, we should consider looking at a consolidated Bill because it can be difficult to follow all the changes, amendments to sub-sections and so on. That happens with much of our legislation and I have been told - the Minister dealing with the enterprise sector is present - that it costs business a great deal of money to have solicitors, barristers and others refer to multiple Acts. I am aware the Law Reform Commission has recommended that we consolidate much more of our legislation to make it less expensive and less onerous on business in terms of the legality of the issues contained therein. The Oireachtas committee recommended that the Garda authority would have the power to refer matters to the GSOC, and I note that is the case in the other Bill. I also welcome the fact that the inspectorate can initiate investigations on its own volition. The Minister can also ask both the inspectorate and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to initiate investigations and inquiries but in the Oireachtas committee we tried to refer certain issues to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and were unable to do so because the justice committee does not deal with the GSOC. That comes under a different parliamentary oversight committee. An issue arises in that regard because GSOC is dealing with policing matters. The justice committee deals with policing matters yet the justice committee cannot oversee what GSOC is doing. The Members of the Oireachtas might examine that. I am not casting aspersions on the oversight committee but we might need to examine that to see if there is something we should change to streamline that entire area. My point is that parliamentary committees might come across issues that need to be investigated or examined and perhaps a parliamentary committee should be given the authority to refer matters either to the inspectorate or to GSOC, or at least bring it to their attention, because such committees often come across issues that are quite important. In terms of GSOC carrying out an inquiry, subsection (3) of section 10 requires GSOC to provide a report to the Minister regarding the examination and to supply a copy of the report to the Garda Commissioner, and the Minister is required to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I suggest the Oireachtas committees should be given the reports at that time also. I do not see any reason that should not be done. That would be important. I raise an issue I have raised previously and which was emphasised on numerous occasions when we visited Scotland and Northern Ireland. We will now have the Garda Inspectorate, the Ombudsman Commission, the Garda authority, the Garda Commissioner, the Minister, and the parliamentary committee but it was stressed to us the importance of all these bodies having a good, professional working relationship, which would be written into a code of conduct. In other words, they would consciously go out of their way to ensure that they have good working relationships. The people we met in Scotland and Northern Ireland emphasised that that was the one aspect that made the whole system work. We have five bodies here now, namely, three oversight bodies, the Garda Inspectorate, the ombudsman and the authority when it is established. They must have professional working relationships. I am not saying they should be in each other's pockets or be too cosy. They cannot be, but there must be mutual respect and understanding and protocols put in place so that they can all do their job to the best of their ability. I said previously that I felt the ombudsman should be the one person in charge. I note the legislation references the chair of the ombudsman commission but why not call that person the "Garda Ombudsman"? The other people could be called the "Deputy Ombudsman" or something like that because that gives the office personality, drive and identity, which it has been lacking until now. That is no reflection on the people involved but until the recent controversies arose, most citizens did not know what GSOC was about. Everyone knows about it now but until those issues arose I do not believe the citizens knew what GSOC was all about. I wish the Bill a quick passage through the House. There is a great deal going on in this area. It is important that we examine and debate this Bill, and that we get it right. It is about GSOC and the surveillance powers GSOC will get. Regarding State security, the Commissioner will report directly to the Minister. That was a recommendation we made. There is mention in the Bill of GSOC and State security but do we need some form of parliamentary oversight in respect of State security? I know it is a delicate issue but in other Parliaments that is the case. We would have to be very careful and responsible about it but it is something we should discuss. Where is the parliamentary oversight on the security side of the Garda, the authority, GSOC and so on. Where is the parliamentary oversight of that? That is important, and we might need to tease out that in the committees and elsewhere to determine if there is some way of having parliamentary oversight of it. I know that security and secrecy is very important but without that there may be a cloud hanging over that area.

#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	453	The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 seeks to expand the power of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, which is responsible for receiving and dealing with complaints made by members of the public concerning the conduct of members of the Garda Síochána, including surveillance powers for their criminal investigations, and allows GSOC to investigate the Garda Commissioner with the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality. It also provides for GSOC to instigate the examination of Garda practices and procedures and for the Garda Inspectorate to initiate inspections without the prior approval of the Minister for Justice and Equality. The objective of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate, as an independent statutory body, is to ensure the resources available to the Garda Síochána are used to achieve and maintain the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness and that it operates an administration as measured by reference to the best standard of comparable police services. In this context, GSOC will be in the same position as the Garda Síochána for the purpose of conducting a criminal investigation.The Bill broadens the scope for the Minister to refer a matter to GSOC to include any matter that gives rise to concern that a member of An Garda Síochána may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that may justify disciplinary procedures. It also directs the Garda Commissioner to ensure information requested by GSOC for the purposes of an investigation is provided as soon as practicable. GSOC and its operations have been the subject of scrutiny and the body itself has pointed to its limitations under current legislation. Its relationship with An Garda Síochána has been the subject of media commentary and Oireachtas debate, with the Cooke report describing an atmosphere of frustration and tension in the relationship between GSOC personnel and the senior ranks of An Garda Síochána. Both organisations have stated they are working to improve the relationship. In 2013 GSOC received 2,027 complaints from members of the public, which was very close to the number received in the previous year, 2,089. The number of allegations of misconduct by gardaí in these complaints was 5,299. In addition, the Garda Commissioner referred 41 incidents to GSOC, eight of which involved fatalities. The four most common allegations in complaints made to GSOC in 2013 were abuse of authority, 34%; neglect of duty, 37%; non-fatal offences, 13%; and discourtesy, 11%. I would like to raise awareness of the difficulties in my constituency. Areas such as Dundalk, Carlingford, Omeath, Dromad, Hackballscross and Blackrock are all under pressure from the ever-increasing risk of crime. Although crime figures have not risen compared to those for 2013, which in no small part is due to the work of local gardaí and the local community, I urge the Minister to increase the resources available to the Garda and local community groups. In my home town, Dundalk, we have a major drugs problem that is causing great distress to the local community. With additional resources, we could combat and eventually eradicate this serious problem. In my area there has been a reduction in personnel of 30 and a decrease of nine in the number of patrol cars. If we can work to increase resources, we will see a substantial reduction in the crime figures. I cannot praise the local community highly enough for its work in combating crime. A meeting in the Mullaghbuoy Community Centre in Cooley, organised by the local community, discussed how to reduce crime in the area, including raising awareness of the dangers posed by drugs and how to deal with drug pushers. Initiatives such as this, with the great work done by An Garda Síochána, are helping to reduce crime in the local community. These initiatives, with the commitment to increase the resources available, will help to combat crime in the community. I look forward to working with the Minister on these matters.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	454	The question is often asked who polices the police, who governs the country or who judges the Judiciary. The same question faces every state and the answer, however varied, goes to the heart of democracy and the doctrine of the separation of powers which features in every legitimate democratic country. In its handbook on policy, accountability, oversight and integrity, the United Nations has set out the features it believes need to be present in any successful police oversight system. These features - independence, transparency and community support - are integral. Transparency is vital in that justice not only needs to be done it also needs to be seen to be done. Just like the police service, the system of oversight needs to be open and accessible. "Community support" is another term for confidence. A successful police service must have the confidence of the public and the same applies to the oversight authority, GSOC. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill will further expand the remit and powers of GSOC. It is worth remembering that GSOC is the independent body responsible for receiving and dealing with complaints from members of the public about the conduct of members of An Garda Síochána. It is a three-person commission with the support of a support staff of approximately 80 and a budget of €8 million. GSOC clearly has the confidence of the public, given the number of complaints, some 2,027, made by the public in 2013. The Bill will make An Garda Síochána more accountable to GSOC but also to the public. Through the new section 102B to be added to the 2005 Act, the Bill will bring the Garda Commissioner within the remit of GSOC for the first time. Such a provision will ensure increased accountability at all levels. The independence of GSOC is strengthened with the new section 102(5A) which will amend section 102 of the 2005 Act and enable the commission to initiate its own investigations into Garda practices and procedures. GSOC will be able to use these powers without recourse to the Minister for Justice and Equality, as is currently the case. Aside from this, the Garda Inspectorate will receive similar powers to initiate its own inspections or inquiries without the need to acquire the consent of the Minister. These measures will increase public confidence in An Garda Síochána and GSOC. It is not enough, however, for the public to have confidence in GSOC; mutual confidence must also be present between the two organisations. The Cooke report on the alleged surveillance of GSOC offices clearly referenced a lack of confidence between the organisations and used the phrase "atmosphere of frustration and tension". It is encouraging that both groups are committed to encouraging improving the relationship. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill will assist the process. Provisions such as section 103A will direct the Garda Commissioner to provide necessary information for GSOC as soon as practicable, while section 13 of the Bill which amends section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 sets out the circumstances in which a judge will authorise surveillance, which is a positive measure. The Bill should be viewed as part of a broader programme. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has stated the broader programme aims to reform the administration and oversight of policing and justice in Ireland. I compliment her on her perseverance in this extensive task. As 2014 draws to a close, after an international competitive process we have a new Garda Commissioner, Nóirín O'Sullivan. I congratulate her and wish her well in her role. We also have a chairperson designate, Josephine Feehily, formerly of the Revenue Commissioners, for the soon-to-be established policing authority which will play a central role in implementing reforms that increase transparency and the accountability of An Garda Síochána. If there is a "Reeling in the Years" programme on the events of 2014, it will go down as a year in which there was a loss of confidence in and concern about many elements of the justice system. We have seen the loss of a Minister, the retirement of a Garda Commissioner and issues concerning GSOC and whistleblowers. This Bill and the establishment of the policing authority will restore necessary confidence in An Garda Síochána and its overseers. It is important there be a reliable body such as GSOC, that people have trust and confidence that it can act as an oversight body for An Garda Síochána. Without this, the confidence of the public is lost and the trust it will have in the police force will be lost. It is welcome that the Garda Commissioner has been brought within the remit of GSOC. I also welcome the extension of GSOC's powers of investigation into complaints of suspected criminal behaviour and which provide greater autonomy for GSOC in examining practices, policies and procedures in An Garda Síochána.  I welcome the publication of the Bill, on which the Minister has done a lot of work. She is continuing her work on the issues raised during 2014 in the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána.

In the past few years public confidence has been eroded in certain procedures in An Garda Síochána. We need a new vision and a new way forward to bring the people back to recognising the great work 99.9% of the members of An Garda Síochána do. It is grand bringing forward Bills in the Dáil, but the reality is that in rural parts of Ireland Garda stations have been closed. Several gardaí have contacted me and told me that while there may be gardaí in a station, the sad reality is that they do not have vehicles to travel the highways and byways. This problem has become worse and in towns such as Carrick-on-Shannon gardaí are down to using two vehicles. I have mentioned how we can talk about the law all we want but without the facilities and vehicles required to tackle crime, there is no point talking about it. I welcome what GSOC is doing and the new Commissioner whom I wish the best of luck. I thought someone from outside would have brought more confidence to people looking in and gardaí, but now that the Commissioner is in place, we wish her the best of luck.

I am not filled with a great deal of confidence with what I saw in the overall plan for next year which was published recently. I do not believe that will be changed with the soon-to-be published divisional and sectoral plans. We could have a philosophical and ideological debate on how we construct society and our priorities in this regard. It is very evident, however, from the HSE’s recently published overall service plan that the Government’s priorities are elsewhere other than in the area of health. I am concerned the ability of front-line health service providers and staff to provide care in a meaningful manner will be further eroded by this service plan. I am not saying that for the sake of it. This has been stated by many of the stakeholders in the health services, reiterated many times by front-line service providers, those at the coalface of health care delivery. It was also stated by Mr. O’Brien, director general of the HSE, at the launch of the 2015 service plan that there would not be sufficient funding in place next year to provide care in the key areas where there are significant pressures because of demographics. He cited pressures on the whole area of caring for the elderly through the fair deal programme and the nursing home support scheme. The other key area, inpatient and outpatient day cases, has an inordinate number of people waiting extraordinary lengths of time to see a consultant or be treated. The figures and statistics are quite alarming. The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, went to great pains when he was appointed to explain that, first and foremost, he wanted a sustainable budget built on sound foundations, one that was honest and upfront in how funding would be provided in the year ahead. However, he also admitted the Department of Health would need €200 million just to address demographic changes every year. When one drills down, examines the extra allocation of funding along with projected savings to be accrued and the other opaque measures for HSE funding, one questions whether its budget is sustainable at all. Whatever way one does the figures, the Minister will be down €85 million. All of this stems from many factors but primarily from the Government’s priorities. It has decided, regardless of whether the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, likes it, to go after other key areas concerning the electorate. When we debate our priorities in society, it is evident the Government’s are not in keeping with what is needed in our society. Up to 2,100 people are waiting a minimum of 15 weeks to be approved for the nursing home support scheme. These are people who are vulnerable, old and sick and who are now looking to the State for support. Several weeks ago I pointed out how not just the waiting time for approval had increased but also the numbers waiting for approval. We went from four weeks with 500 people waiting in January to 2,100 waiting for 15 weeks this month. Today, a woman from Blarney, County Cork, informed me she had to take her husband out of a nursing home because she could not afford the costs she would incur between now and approval time for a fair deal nursing home support scheme bed. At the same time, we have the Taoiseach, whenever a microphone is put before him and he is willing to answer a question, talking consistently about one issue only: tax cuts. Every Member accepts there are significant pressures on working families and any alleviation of the burden on them is welcome. The priorities must also focus, however, on reducing the level of tax back to people earning substantial sums of money and reorienting it towards those who need the support of the State. Up to €35 million was to be ring-fenced every year for the funding of mental health services, the Minister of State’s responsibility. On numerous occasions, Members on all sides of the House have described mental health services as the Cinderella of the health services in that it does not get its fair share of funding and is consistently neglected. Commitments were made in the programme for Government to improve mental health services. Every year, the HSE’s service plan has provided for the rolling out of improved funding for mental health services. From the funding allocated for mental health services in the HSE’s 2015 service plan, it is quite evident that much work still has to be done to ensure adequate resources are put in place for the area. I know the Minister of State has answered numerous questions on this issue in the House and that she has made the clarion call for progress to be made in this area. While I accept there has been an element of progress, judging it against the commitments the Government said it would honour, however, it is still very shy in increased recruitment and the adequate provision of funding for next year due to the shortfall this year. Year on year, the mental health services budget is in deficit, which creates significant pressure on community services to deliver care for those with mental illnesses. This is not just said on the Opposition side of the House. Issues have been raised by advocates and stakeholders involved in the provision of care in mental health services, yet the Government consistently ignores the pleas from those who see overloaded, overburdened and inadequate services to deal with the mental health crisis in our communities. Free GP care is another central plank of the Government’s health policy. The programme for Government stated there would be free GP care available to everyone by the end of 2016. We are 16 months shy of the Government’s full term but no nearer to that commitment being honoured, other than the fact that the Minister for Health said he is in negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation and hopes to have agreement some time on the framework for the roll-out of free GP care for those under six and the over-70s. However, there is the continued culling of medical cards for the over-70s. I remember the Taoiseach, when leader of Fine Gael in opposition, and the former Tánaiste, when leader of the Labour Party in opposition, on Kildare Street shouting shame on the then Fianna Fáil Government for attempting to reduce the number of medical cards for older people, exploiting anger and concerns among those affected. What has happened consistently since is that more medical cards have been taken off people. Not only that, the terms for qualification have been made so strenuous and onerous that the cut-off income point for a retired couple is now €900 gross a week. It comes back to priorities. The fuel allowance, telephone allowance and other home packages, which were seen as de facto entitlements for older people, have been stripped away slowly but surely. I know Government party Deputies will tread carefully in their criticisms during these kinds of debates.Reading between the lines, they can see the Government has reneged on commitments it made to the electorate prior to the last election to ensure adequate services for older people. In this regard I highlight the nursing homes support scheme, medical cards, household packages, fuel allowance, bereavement grants and so on. All of these things have been taken away slowly and by stealth so that people do not notice for some time. The Government uses spin and PR to cover its tracks on a U-turn of mammoth proportions on commitments for older people. The details of the plan highlight many other deficiencies. More than 50,000 people are now waiting as inpatient day cases and over 200 consultant posts are vacant. Some 380,000 people are waiting to see a consultant through an outpatient appointment, and all of this means there has been an increasing backlog in the system in the past number of months. Mr. O'Brien, the director general of the HSE, stated this on the day of the launch. The contents of this motion are simple and cannot be refuted, though the Government will obviously table an amendment and vote down the stated fact that the health service is under-funded. The 2015 Health Service Executive national plan is not sufficient to fully address increasing demands and demographic pressures that are being placed on the hospital system. The key targets in the plan are regarded as unrealistic by its authors, the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE. Those who drafted the plan have stated that it will not achieve its targets as some of them are unrealistic. This motion is intended to highlight hypocrisy and, more important, the pain the HSE service plan will cause to ordinary people throughout the country due to the lack of priorities. The plan fails to emphasise key areas. There has been a U-turn on discretionary medical cards, but issues persist every day. A recent blog post by a parent highlighted the disgraceful way his son was treated when it came to a discretionary medical card. The card was granted to the child and then taken away. I raised this matter with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in an interview last week. There is a pretence that all is now well with the primary care reimbursement scheme and the manner in which people are assessed and their concerns addressed. Spin and PR were used the other day to blame doctors for failing to issue cards. All of this is an effort to camouflage the obvious: the policies pursued by this Government on discretionary medical cards were disgraceful and distasteful, to say the least. For over two years, this side of the House has consistently highlighted the problem in a non-alarmist, matter-of-fact way through Private Members' motions and on Leaders' Questions. A perusal of parliamentary questions will show that this is a major problem in society. We will have to wait and see whether it has been addressed, but the signs are not encouraging. As late as last week we saw cases in which people with major challenges and illnesses had discretionary medical cards withdrawn. As I said, the problem was recently publicised by the parent of a child. I have addressed waiting lists and the HSE service plan as it relates to the nursing homes support scheme. I will now address the broad issues in Government health policy. Universal health insurance was a key point in the five-point plan. At the moment a Minister is being applauded and feted as honest for performing a U-turn on one of the central planks of Government policy, as stated in the programme for Government. I am referring to the abolition of the HSE and the establishment of trusts, followed by a move towards a money-follows-the-patient model that leads, ultimately, to universal health insurance. The Taoiseach launched the White Paper on universal health insurance but, at the same time, the Department of Health advised anyone who would listen at a political level that universal health insurance was unworkable. The Department said it would involve the setting up of too many organisations and quangos and would not provide the level of care we were led to believe it would. Universal health care was not costed at that stage and it still has not been costed - we are still waiting to know what the universal health insurance model will cost taxpayers. The former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, was fixated on the Dutch model of health care, but this was on a wing and a prayer because costings were not done. If one reads reports published by eminent authors on the cost of the Dutch model, one learns that the universal health insurance model pursued by Deputy Reilly would cost the average family €12,000 per year. The Government is still stated to be pursuing this policy, though the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, says he has abandoned it. The figure of €12,000 is reached by combining what a family would pay in general taxation with the fee for compulsory health insurance. The reports are widely available. According to one of the authors, Michael van den Berg, the figure of €12,000 figure relates to gross income and includes premiums and taxes but not out-of-pocket expenses and payments. If the latter costs - for dental care, over-the-counter medicines and so on - are included, the total figure is higher, including €6,000 for health insurance premiums and more than €5,000 for exceptional medical expenses. It is clear that no thought went into this proposal for universal health care, which was proffered as a panacea and a utopian model to address all health service concerns. One thing is for sure in December 2014: we are pretending our health budget will address the huge challenges facing people in need of services in 2015. This pretence goes on year in, year out. There is a potential budget deficit of over €500 million in 2014, and this will be carried into 2015, so the Minister of State will start off at minus €85 million. Regardless of spin, palaver and pronouncements, I have little hope that the health service will deliver in the key areas that we know face major problems. We know this already because of demographic changes and the fact that the number of people over 80 years of age is growing at 4% per annum. These statistics are available for all to see, but the Government continues to prioritise other areas rather than putting money where it is most needed. Any fair and rational assessment would show that older people deserve the support of the State after all the years they have served it. People with profound physical and intellectual disabilities should be supported and so should those who are dependent on mental health services. People who should be entitled to access health care with a discretionary medical card are being denied this facility as we speak. The aim of this motion is to highlight all of these issues. I hope that in the context of this debate people will have the honesty to say what they are experiencing with regard to the difficulties facing people, including front-line staff, representatives of front-line staff and those who are at the coalface on a daily basis. I ask that the Government listen to their pleadings and the pleadings of people who are dependent on the health service but get insufficient support.For all these reasons I commend the motion to the House. I hope we have a robust and honest debate on the matter in which we can at least point to a different and fairer way of ensuring people have access to services when they most need them.

What we are led to believe is in that report is disgraceful and appalling. As public representatives, none of us can be comfortable with it. Why, ten years after the Leas Cross scandal, are we depending on RTE once again to shine a light on this issue? Someone in HIQA or the HSE has dropped the ball. Yesterday, we saw representatives from the HSE wringing their hands and saying that it was awful, but that does not excuse the HSE from responsibility. This has happened under either their watch or the watch of HIQA. All of the constituency Deputies - I mean all of them - knew there had been resource pressures in Áras Attracta for some time. They are directly linked. The majority of the staff there do a very good job in difficult circumstances. It has served our community well. Since it is in her area of responsibility I call on the Minister of State to make the resource allocation necessary to bring Áras Attracta up to standard and to take the decisions necessary to restore its reputation. Once again we are depending on RTE to shine the light. Someone in the HSE or HIQA should have done that job. We cannot depend on RTE to give coverage or attention to every health care facility in the country. I welcome today's report on the ambulance service. However what we need to see in the service plan but what is not evident is a detailed month by month implementation plan on where the allocations will be spent. In respect of the service plan for ambulances I welcome the staffing commitment to the bases at Mulranny and Loughglynn but when will the notice for staff be advertised? In what month will staff be in place at Mulranny and Loughglynn? The ambulance personnel on the road are doing a phenomenal job. Tonight, God knows how many of them are facing unbelievable circumstances in trying to bring people to safety. However, those in management are disconnected from the reality. The difficulties we have in getting information from the National Ambulance Service makes North Korea look like a functioning democracy. Last year the Minister of State intervened - I thank her for her intervention - to get information on an incident that happened in 2013 in which an ambulance took two hours to come to a case in Ballina. It took me three months to get that information. There have been two further incidents this year. The first took place in Castlebar in October, around the corner from Mayo General Hospital. Gardaí decided to bring the patient to the hospital because it was quicker than waiting for an ambulance to come around the corner. I have sought information on that case but I cannot get it because the service has moved its base to Ballyshannon. We are in a digital computer age but that is this year's excuse. Another incident occurred in Ballina town. Someone took ill in the middle of the summer and it took an hour to get an ambulance to the person in question. We cannot get information on that case either. As well as investment in resources a change of culture is needed. The organisation should be more giving and sharing in respect of information. It is incredible that the organisation does not have basic management information, such as where vehicles are and the nature of incidents that have happened. That information should be available at the touch of a button. The notion of making public representatives beg for it and having to seek the intervention of a Minister are ridiculous. It amounts to those in the service telling this House that they have no respect for our role. It is time they copped on to themselves. It is time the management in the National Ambulance Service stood up and took responsibility for the service they are running rather than leaving the people who deliver the service to take the brunt of people's frustration. Deputy Kelleher referred to the medical card situation. We all welcome last week's announcement but the reality is, as Deputy Kelleher has said, that it is still going on. Somewhere in Government Buildings a press conference was held. I do not doubt the intention of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, to change the system but somebody has forgotten to tell the people in the office in Finglas that this system has changed. I will outline a case. The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has the details. I will not name names. It involves an elderly couple. Both are retired, one is on a private pension and the other is on a social welfare pension. The man had a quadruple bypass earlier this year and is suffering from serious chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He has an oxygen tank beside him everywhere he goes. The lady is suffering from a form of cancer which has claimed a number of members of her immediate family and she is currently undergoing treatment. The gentleman finds it difficult to leave his house. They lost a discretionary medical card on 1 April this year. Since then we have been over and back with the service, like many Deputies. On 1 July the discretionary cards were re-approved and granted, valid from 26 June to July 2015. On the 12th of this month the lady went to register for chemotherapy and was told while having chemotherapy that her card was no longer valid. On the same day, while she was in Galway, the gentleman was at home. He received a telephone call from his general practitioner to say the card was no longer valid. Then he received a letter to say the cards, which were due to be valid to July 2015, had been withdrawn. They have not won the lotto in the meantime; there has been no change in their circumstances or income. We contacted the primary care reimbursement service. We received an e-mail from the PCRS on 17 November stating that those medical cards were valid and there was no problem with them. Then we got a letter on 18 November stating they were no longer valid because they had been reviewed. One hand does not know what the other hand is doing. We challenged and queried this. New GP cards were sent out in the post. Now there are two valid GP visit cards and two full medical cards that are valid as well. There are four cards in the house. A telephone call was received on 19 November stating that the GP card was no longer valid. We have been over and back to the PCRS. On 21 November someone from the PCRS rang the house to say it was all a mistake, that they were genuinely very sorry and two full medical cards were issued again on the basis of that telephone call. Then, last week we got an e-mail stating that the cards were being withdrawn and that a full review was under way. Last Friday I received an e-mail advising me that having queried the Department the PCRS could confirm that no further information could be added to the application in question and that since it has been previously reassessed, the application had closed. The e-mail stated that the letter dated 11 November referred. This was the letter that took away the card previously but which was subsequently replaced by e-mail stating the cards were still valid. This is what is going on. All of this was in the case of a patient with COPD who cannot walk around his house without having an oxygen tank beside him and whose wife is in Galway having chemotherapy. One arm of the HSE will not talk to the other and as a result people are being put through trauma and stress. They should not have to ring my office. They should not have to endure the pressure of ringing my office and worrying about where the medical card is and whether they can afford the can of oxygen next week, but that is the reality. They have a small private pension and an invalidity pension but this is what they are being forced to do. The e-mail of last Friday got a zinger of a response, which I copied to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, because it seems the only way to get anything done is to get a Minister involved to talk sense. That is the new regime of medical cards. Will the Minister of State clarify when the new regime actually kicks in? When will the local input actually kick in? When will there be some sort of justice or human touch rather than the "computer says no" approach, which is what governs how a medical card is issued in this country at the moment? It is time that humans said "Yes" in cases like this and in cases of parents with children with a disability or Down's syndrome. It goes back to priorities. We will cut the tax rate for those on the highest rates but we will not give a child with Down's syndrome a medical card and we will force two old people to be put through the ringer like this. The priorities are so wrong. I am only one of 166 Deputies. Every Government Deputy will come to the House tonight with a script. The cheerleaders will say the Minister of State is the best thing since sliced bread, but they know the reality when it comes to medical cards and the ambulance service and so much else outlined in the service plan, as does the Minister of State, because they are dealing with it themselves.

Tá go leor le plé. The first decision we must make collectively is whether we want a proper health service and then we must decide if we are willing to fund it. Choices are made and sometimes the choice is to reduce taxes. At other times, the choice is made to improve services. We must be conscious as money inevitably becomes available that rather than promise next year's tax cuts, as is already happening, we should have a rational, adult debate as to what we need to do. I am not talking about people on €38,000 to €40,000. If one reduces the top tax rate by 1%, it helps a person on €1 million a year a lot more. Before we start doing top-of-the-head budgets, we must decide if we require more money to provide a health service. I am sure that the Minister of State and her Department are convinced in their hearts and souls that they can require efficiencies in services. Given that there are human being running the health service, however, it will never be fully efficient. We must recognise that while we must make things as efficient as humans can make them, a flawless service where everyone turns up every day and is motivated will never exist. Therefore, the Department must plan how to get the best service given the real human beings who run it with all their differences and the issues that arise and then ask if it has enough money on that basis to run it. It is becoming clear that we have not put enough money into health. There is no cheap way of doing health. Every country in the world is facing a challenge in regard to people's expectations of health services versus the budgetary requirements. I am not saying there should be an infinite budget, but we must have a rational and reasonable debate about this as a society. I believe we can make different choices to those we are making. I remember saying many times when we were in government that no matter how much money one had, one would find a good way to spend it. No matter how much one is given, one's budget is finite. As every budget is finite, one must make choices no matter what state one lives in. One issue that is a question of choice involves the nursing home subvention scheme. Currently, there is a 16-week waiting list from the time one gets approval to the time one goes into payment. One can take it that there will have been a lapse of eight weeks from the time a person went into the nursing home to the time he or she obtained the approval. Very few people get the approval to go into a nursing home before they go there. In many cases, something happens which means a person must enter a nursing home suddenly. That can mean a total wait of 24 weeks as I saw in a recent case. Every few weeks, one is notified of a case involving the wait for nursing home subvention. Nursing home care can cost up to €1,000 per week. Even if a person has a pension of €200, €700 must be found in cash. Over a 20-week period, that amounts to €14,000. Over a 24-week period, it is €16,800, which is a great deal of money. It is serious money to pay while waiting. This scheme is unique in a particular respect. Social welfare payments are backdated to the date of application but nursing home subvention is not even backdated to the date of approval. The Minister of State might ask where I would get the money to do away with the waiting list. If there was a finite waiting list of a couple of weeks, while people would not be happy, at least it would be controllable. I would get the money by suspending the provision of GP cards to every person aged over 70 years. I would leave the limits which have been set in place. How much can GP services cost a person who has a €100,000 pension in one year? Even if one went once a week, which would be a lot of visits to make, it would only amount to approximately €3,600 at €50 to €60 a visit. That is not a great deal of money by comparison with the kind of bill I am talking about, which can run to €24,000 or €25,000 gross. Even if one set one's whole pension against the nursing home fee, it would still run to €16,000 to €18,000. Very few people visit the doctor every week. If one were that ill, one would probably get a medical card on health grounds. The other scheme I would suspend is the proposal to give GP cards without means testing to everybody under six years old. I have grandchildren in that age group and am aware of what children need. A normal healthy child who does not have a disability or underlying health issue may visit a GP five or six times a year. If he or she has a disability or health issue, he or she should be given a card on medical grounds, but we are talking about a universal giving away irrespective of income. If a child visited the doctor four or five times a year, it would amount to €240. While parents are currently feeling pressure, it is nothing like the €16,000 to €25,000 pressure we are currently imposing on older people. By definition, all of these older people are means tested in respect of the nursing home subvention scheme and, as such, have been determined to need the support. Therefore, they are digging into something to try to come up with the money. It would take a little courage to do one of the things that can be done. I note that according to the Department's own projections, there will be a little extra funding due to the diversion of €25 million from getting people out of hospitals earlier. That will have a €10 million effect and will cut the list in the short but not the long term. I share the Minister of State's concern about the following and acknowledge that it is unlikely she will be allowed to stand up and give her real thoughts on the issue. Whereas I welcome the €20 million for disability, I note the effect of demographic pressures and cumulative cutbacks. There was a point at the beginning where savings were being made and services were being slimlined that needed to be. I accept that. However, there comes a point where there is no more flesh and the cut is being made right into the bone. I note that €20 million is not enough. I have always felt that we have not recognised the challenges people face where a member of a family has a disability. Families make huge sacrifices and need very good support services. People with disabilities are not ill but rather require continuous support. They have a lifetime to live and it is very mean to impose cuts on their sector. It will be very important to determine how much money we need to provide adequate services taking demographics into account. I would like to know the true figure. We know we have more people with disabilities and, thanks be to God, that they live a lot longer due to medical improvements. Extra money is not in fact extra money. It is the cost of standing still. The provision of €20 million will not ensure that services remain at the same level. I would be very interested to hear the Minister of State's thoughts about that. While it is not a matter directly under the remit of the Minister of State's Department, I note a proposal I have made previously which I would still like to see being implemented. I proposed at one stage the restructuring of domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance.The savings achieved from this restructuring should be moved to the domiciliary care scheme. An allowance should be provided until the age of 18 years but no 16 year old should receive payments of the magnitude of disability benefit. I would use the savings to provide a top-up to the domiciliary care allowance in the two years before children commence school. This would allow parents to purchase additional services.  We refer repeatedly to early intervention. The savings to which I refer could be recycled to deliver early intervention. This creative and constructive change could be implemented over a period without having a budgetary effect. It would, however, put to better use the overall funding available for this type of care. 
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	463	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:"welcomes the Health Service Executive’s national service plan for 2015;recognises that the Government, in next year’s budget, has made provision for a welcome increase in the total financial resources available to the Health Service Executive, HSE, in 2015, and that this is reflected in the plan;notes that this increase in funding, which is comprised of additional Exchequer funding of €305 million, increased projected once-off revenues of €330 million, and minimum savings of €130 million in areas such as procurement and drug and agency costs, is part of a two year programme to stabilise and improve health funding after seven years of significant retrenchment as a direct consequence of the emergency financial situation the Irish State has had to address;further notes the fact that the Health Service Executive's 2015 national service plan provides generally for the delivery of existing levels of service while additionally targeting service enhancement in a number of priority areas through increased funding provision and further progress in the health service reform programme;further recognises that:— these enhancements include programme for Government commitments to extend the BreastCheck programme, the introduction of free general practitioner, GP, care without fees for those over 70 years of age and under six years of age, an expansion of mental health services, and further investment in suicide prevention; and there is also provision for 20,000 additional day surgery cases, additional funding of €2 million to improve maternity services, improved pilot ultrasound access for GPs in priority care sites and additional spending on community orthodontic and ophthalmic services; and— an additional €25 million is being provided to help address delayed discharges from acute settings which will fund a range of community and non-acute supports, including an additional 300 places under the nursing homes support scheme, the provision of 115 short-stay beds, including the opening of Mount Carmel as a community hospital for Dublin, 600 additional home care packages and the extension of community intervention teams; andsupports the fact that the plan includes a considerably enhanced governance and accountability framework for 2015 which describes in detail the means by which the HSE and, within this, hospital groups, community health care organisations and other units will be held to account in 2015 for their efficiency and control in relation to service provision, patient safety, finance and human resources."While those of us who live outside Dublin are used to community hospitals, the opening of short-say beds in Mount Carmel marks the first time such a hospital has opened in the capital. I will not address the suggestions made by Deputy Ó Cuív as I propose to stick to the prepared script for a change because it provides a detailed statement on the service plan. Private Members' business is structured in a way that does not allow for the type of informal debate that would be well worth having. Perhaps we should seek to arrange an informal and respectful debate on the issues raised by the Deputies opposite. All of us agree that the difficulty lies in the cost of change and how we would allow people to live a different life. A serious examination of this cost of change is needed.  I very much welcome this opportunity to address the House on the Health Service Executive's national service plan for 2015. It is important to recognise that the funding provisions set out in the 2015 plan constitute a very welcome turn of the tide after an unprecedented seven years of significant and continuing reductions in funding for health and social care services. In the period between 2008 and 2014, funding in excess of €1.5 billion was taken out of the health budget as a direct consequence of the financial emergency the State had to address. During this period of unprecedented budgetary constraint, the number of health sector staff was also reduced by more than 11% or almost 12,000 employees at a time when demand for health services continues to increase owing to the welcome growth in and ageing of the population. It is important in this context to acknowledge the resilience demonstrated by workers across the health service during these most difficult of times and the significant efficiencies and improvements in productivity that were achieved during this period. It is also important to acknowledge the improvements across a range of services, including stroke, cardiac and cancer services. Improvements in cancer services had their origins in measures which were introduced and driven by the previous Government. These achievements were made despite ever reducing budgetary ceilings and staffing resources.  Against this backdrop, it is most welcome to be able to report to the House that in 2015 the Health Service Executive will have an improved rather than sharply reduced level of resources to work with in delivering health and social care services to members of the public. The health allocation provided for in the 2015 budget constitutes a first step in reversing the prolonged cycle of budget cuts and is part of a two year process to stabilise and improve health funding. With this in mind, the spending ceiling for health in 2016 has been also already increased upwards by a further €174 million. For the first time since 2008, health funding is moving in the right direction. The net result is a very welcome increase in the financial resources available to the HSE in 2015. The HSE will have €635 million more to spend next year than it did this time last year. This figure is made up of additional Exchequer funding of €305 million and projected one-off revenues of €330 million. The HSE has also identified a minimum savings target of €130 million in areas such as procurement and drugs and agency costs. In a welcome new development, any further savings that can be achieved over and above this target will go back into the delivery of health and social care services and will not be used to reduce the Exchequer provision, as occurred in previous years. Given overall expenditure constraints and other pressures on the public purse, it is important that full use is made of this incentive as a dynamic contributor to the delivery and reform of services within the expenditure level determined by government. The more realistic budget parameters for 2015 have allowed the HSE to prepare a service plan which further progresses key elements of the health service reform programme and targets certain priority health and social care service enhancements in a number of areas, while providing generally for the delivery of existing levels of health and social care services. Deputy Kelleher should note that this was the point made by the director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien. Next year will be an important year for demonstrating the benefits of key reforms in the health service. We must all work collectively to improve safety, quality and the patient experience for those who depend on our services. It is also vital that qualitative aspects, such as the personal care and attention that patients receive, are the subject of focused efforts in order that people's experience of the health service is not only safe but also caring and pleasant. I particularly welcome the integrated approach across acute, community and residential care settings to which the HSE has committed in its service plan to ensure patients are supported at all stages in the care setting that is most appropriate to their needs. This is most important in the context of the establishment and further development of the hospital groups and community health care organisations. The reorganisation of public hospitals into hospital groups is designed to deliver improved outcomes for patients. The hospitals in each group will work together to provide acute care for patients in their area, integrating with community and primary care. The objective is to maximise the amount of care delivered locally while ensuring that complex care is safely provided in larger hospitals. The next phase of implementation of the hospital groups to implement fully the seven hospital group constructs is provided for in the service plan. Hospital groups will also develop and deliver strategic plans in 2015, setting out how each group will provide high-quality, safe, integrated patient care in a cost-efficient manner during next year. The Government is also committed to the introduction of activity-based funding, formerly known as money follows the patient, whereby hospitals are paid for the quality care they deliver. This funding model will drive efficiencies and increase transparency in the provision of high-quality hospital services. The HSE intends to implement this new funding model further on a phased basis during 2015. In addition, 2015 will see the establishment of national community health care organisations and their management structures by the HSE. This represents an important step in improving how primary care in the community is delivered. The new structures will improve services for the public by providing better and easier access to services, closer to where people live and in which people can have confidence. I also want to highlight the work of the national clinical programmes as an example of clinical leadership. They have already greatly improved services in many specialised areas, such as stroke and cardiac services. The HSE service plan will see the development of these national clinical programmes into five integrated care programmes, dealing with patient flow, older persons, chronic disease prevention and management, children's health and maternal health, and will improve the integration of services, access, and outcomes for patients generally. These developments will ensure that the new integrated clinical programmes are very much at the centre of operational delivery and reform, and I warmly welcome this development. There are many positive service developments provided for in next year's HSE service plan. Key commitments in the programme for Government that will be delivered next year include the extension of the BreastCheck programme, the introduction of free GP care to the youngest and oldest in our society, an expansion in the level of investment in our mental health services, and further investment in suicide prevention. There is also provision for 20,000 additional day surgery cases, additional funding of €2 million to improve maternity services, improved pilot ultrasound access for GPs in priority care sites and additional spending on community orthodontic and ophthalmic services. An additional €25 million is being provided to help address delayed discharges from acute settings which will fund a range of community and non-acute supports, including an additional 300 beds under the fair deal scheme, the provision of 115 short-stay beds, including the opening of Mount Carmel as a community hospital for Dublin, 600 more home care packages and the extension of community intervention teams. As Deputy Ó Cuív correctly said, this is an issue into which we need to put more resources and plan well for into the future. I will provide further detail on a number of the priority health and social care service enhancements set out in the 2015 service plan. Breast cancer survival rates in Ireland have improved significantly in recent years through a combined approach of screening, symptomatic detection and improved treatment. Additional funding is being provided in the HSE service plan to commence the extension of the BreastCheck screening programme next year to women aged 65 to 69 years of age. Screening of the extended cohort will commence towards the end of 2015 and will be expanded incrementally. The additional eligible population is approximately 10,000, and when fully implemented, 540,000 women will be included. The 2015 service plan provides for the implementation of the first two phases of a universal GP service, making available a GP service without fees to all children under six years of age and all persons over 70 years of age . The aim is to have universal GP care without fees for children under six years of age implemented early next year, subject to the conclusion of discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation and the completion of a fee-setting process. The measures for those over 70 years of age will be facilitated under the existing general medical card contract after the relevant legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas. By the end of next year, almost half of the population will have access to GP services without charges. That is a major step on the way to universal health care. In response to Deputy Calleary, there are many medical cards in the system. What happened in the case he cited should not have happened, but when there are many cards in the system, one will always have hard cases because of the human element. We need to ensure what he described happens to as few people as possible. The service plan also provides an additional €30 million to fund access to new hepatitis C drugs in 2015. This has the potential to bring major benefits for patients with serious illness as a result of hepatitis C. As with other countries, Ireland must ensure that access to high-cost treatments such as these is managed so as to prioritise access for patients who can benefit most, while also ensuring that the financing model is sustainable and affordable. The aim is to provide access for as many patients as possible with the resources provided by taxpayers. An early access programme for more than 100 patients with the greatest clinical need for these new direct acting anti-viral drugs is already in place. Budget 2015 provides an additional €35 million in ring-fenced funding for mental health. This will bring to €125 million the total investment by the Government in mental health services since 2012. The additional funding will enable the HSE to continue to develop and modernise our mental health services in line with A Vision for Change.  This includes the ongoing development and reconfiguration of general adult teams, including psychiatry of later life, and also child and adolescent community mental health teams, along with other specialist mental health services. This will be delivered through further recruitment and investment in agencies and services to achieve a consistent provision of quality services across all areas. It will supplement the considerable investment since 2012 in the recruitment of up to 1,100 posts, which is due to be completed in 2015 when all the posts allocated for 2014 will be fully recruited. The funding will also permit urgent specialist needs to be addressed, including services for those with mental illness and an intellectual disability, psychiatric liaison services and addressing the gap for low secure acute care and rehabilitation services for service users with complex needs. Suicide prevention services will continue to be funded under the mental health heading, in line with the mental health promotion and stigma reduction objectives of A Vision for Change. A new suicide prevention strategy to replace Reach Out 2005-2014, the current national strategy, is in the final stages of development. Subject to Government approval, it is expected to be launched in early 2015. Deputies will be aware that there has been a continuing upward trend in delayed discharges since the beginning of this year, with approximately 850 delayed discharges reported nationally. That is the equivalent of a large hospital. This is having a knock-on effect on hospital emergency departments, levels of elective admissions and on the health and welfare of the patients. I am very conscious of the upset this causes for patients and their families. Many of these patients are elderly and have been medically assessed as being well enough to leave hospital. Their health needs would be better met at home, in step-down facilities or in long-term residential care. In response to these concerns, the 2015 service plan includes an additional €25 million to help address the issue of delayed discharges. This includes €10 million to support an additional 300 long-stay care places under the nursing home support scheme and to reduce waiting times for funding under the scheme to 11 weeks; €8 million to provide 115 short-stay beds, including the opening of Mount Carmel as a community hospital for Dublin; €5 million in extra funding to support an additional 400 home care packages; and €2 million to expand community intervention teams to deal with 2,000 referrals each year. This additional funding in the service plan will allow the HSE to continue to progress the realignment of services towards home care and other community-based support services, where appropriate, to maximise the potential for older people to be cared for in their homes, close to their families and within their own local communities. Services will continue to be provided to avoid hospital admission and support early discharge through step-down, transitional care and rehabilitation beds, while maximising access to appropriate, quality, long-term residential care when this becomes necessary. It is also recognised that the matter of delayed discharges is not a matter that can wait until the new year to be addressed further and, in this regard, measures are under way to deal with this area of concern throughout the closing weeks of this year. Other developments for 2015 include provision for 20,000 additional day surgery cases, additional funding of €2 million to improve maternity services and further development of primary care services, with an additional allocation of €14 million to fund measures to allow people to receive a wide range of high-quality services in their communities without having to present at hospital accident and emergency departments. This, in turn, will ease pressure on our hospital system. An example of developments that will be initiated in this area in 2015 include the extension of the pilot ultrasound access project to additional primary care sites on a prioritised basis next year and the provision of additional minor surgery services in agreed primary care settings and sites. There will also be an extension of GP out-of-hours services, within existing resources, to areas currently not covered, and additional spending on community orthodontic and ophthalmic services. It is of utmost importance that patient safety remains an overriding priority across the health service in 2015, and this is reflected throughout the HSE's service plan. All health service staff, individually and collectively, will continue to have responsibility for the quality of services they deliver to the patients and service users in their care. It is important that they integrate a commitment to quality and safety into their core work and practice. Priority areas that were identified in this year's service plan will continue to be the focus of attention. These include medication safety, health-care-associated infections and the implementation of the national early warning score system. The HSE will also have more autonomy with regard to staffing and human resources in 2015 and will be in a position to take on more temporary or permanent staff in order to achieve savings on agency costs, subject to compliance with its overall pay allocation. The HSE will be in a position to more readily contain and control the frequency and cost of agency staffing across both the HSE and HSE-funded services in 2015. The plan includes measures to bring this into effect, including the replacement of agency staff by fixed-purpose employment contracts and a focus on the retention of graduate nurses. Management of health spending within available resources next year will require an exceptional management focus, with strict adherence by all services and budget holders to their allocations. However, with greater autonomy and greater capacity to utilise any further savings achieved within the health service comes an even greater responsibility for cost containment and cost avoidance. With this in mind, the HSE's 2015 service plan will continue to develop and strengthen its governance and accountability framework. The service plan provides for a considerably enhanced governance and accountability framework for 2015. This framework describes in detail the means by which the HSE, hospital groups, community health organisations and other units will be held to account throughout 2015 for their efficiency and control across the balanced scorecard of access to services, patient safety, finance and human resources. A key feature of the new accountability framework will be the introduction of formal performance agreements between the director general and each national director for services and between each hospital group and community health care organisation head and the relevant national director. The framework is primarily focused on supporting improved performance. However, a feature of the framework is an arrangement for escalating areas of underperformance and specifying the range of interventions to be taken in the event of such underperformance. Notwithstanding the positive and welcome developments that are provided for in the 2015 service plan, HSE management, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I have been honest and up-front about the limited nature of what can be achieved with the additional funding available next year. It is also apparent that we do not have sufficient funds to address all areas of concern across the health sector immediately. For example, on the matter of the increasing demands and demographic pressures being placed on our hospital system, health care demand continues to rise due to our growing and aging population, the increasing incidence of chronic conditions and advances in medical technologies and treatments. While the service plan provides for an increase in combined inpatient and day case activity in 2015 as against 2014 projected outturn, the Minister and I have acknowledged that there are too many people waiting far too long for operations and outpatient appointments. The service plan includes a number of measures that the HSE is putting in place to address waiting lists more efficiently, including flexible usage of theatre capacity within and between specialties and prioritisation of day surgery admissions where appropriate. Other initiatives set out in the service plan, such as action on delayed discharges and developments in the primary care area, will also help to reduce the pressure on the acute system. Against this background, the increase in health funding secured for next year cannot address all of the challenges the health service undoubtedly faces. What the additional funding can do is to make a very welcome start, after seven years of reduced resources, in the restoration of stability to the health service budget. The increase in funding will not solve every problem, but it does make the funding situation more manageable and the targets set out in the service plan more realistic and achievable. For the first time in seven years, the HSE service plan has not been prepared against a background of further retrenchment and reductions in both funding and staffing resources. As a result, the HSE has been able to prepare its service plan in the knowledge that the increase in funding available next year is the first part of a two-year process to restore stability and certainty to the health system and the funding of health services. This, in turn, has allowed the HSE, in its plan, to continue to provide existing levels of service while maintaining an overriding focus on quality and patient safety, and to deliver certain new service enhancements in line with programme for Government commitments. The early completion and approval of the 2015 service plan also means that the HSE can complete its detailed operational planning within the next two to three weeks. This will ensure that the executive is in a position to monitor its spending and performance from the outset of the year, which is of central importance from a governance and accountability perspective. I strongly commend the Government's amendment supporting the HSE's 2015 service plan to the House.

I am sorry Deputy Martin is not present tonight, because he was the architect of much of our health policy. I am curious as to why we are debating the motion outlined by the Fianna Fáil Party, because we now have a health system on the brink of reform and have a better health budget than in the past seven years. I accept we have a difficulty in regard to the reconfiguration of the service, particularly in the south. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider this, particularly in regard to ophthalmology and the reconfiguration of these services in Cork, because the deficits in that area need to be addressed.  I am amazed that we are discussing a Private Members' motion on health put forward by a party that has no plan or policy.

It has not been abandoned, as Deputy Kelleher knows, and the Future Health strategy framework is the blueprint for that. Let us look at what the Government has done in its time in office in terms of the clinical programmes and in terms of capital. Today, we were at the national children's hospital, which is going to be built and which is a commendable sign of this Government's commitment. It is important that we have a constitutional convention-type approach in health. I believe we might look at having 100 people from all the different parts of the health system come together, devoid of their personal and professional interest, to have a detailed national conversation around our health system and how we can deliver it in a way that has the patient at the centre, at the coal face, and where vested interest is left outside. The Minister of State alluded in her speech to the recruitment of front-line staff. The Fianna Fáil motion had a simple proposal that it would only recruit occupational and physical therapists. As Deputy Kelleher knows, while that is laudable, it fails to take account of the needs across the health system. I have always said in the House that the moratorium in health is not a one-size-fits-all approach and there are certain specialties which require a different approach. For example, the Minister of State has driven and achieved much in the area of mental health. Following this speech, I will give the Minister of State a letter dealing with the issue of recruitment. I would like to bring to her attention the need for a child and adolescent psychiatrist with CAMHS serving the areas of Ballyphehane, Togher and Ballincollig in the city and county of Cork. That post has been advertised but it has not been possible to fill it, which is part of our difficulty. I commend the Government amendment.

The service plan lays out the type and level of services that the HSE is to provide both directly and through agencies funded by it. The Fianna Fáil motion before the House focuses on this plan. In doing so, it focuses on one of the most important roles of government - providing appropriate, accessible health services. These are the services that we, as citizens, need right from our birth and throughout all our lives. Citizens are entitled to health services of a high quality and that respond to their needs. Good health is something we only fully appreciate when we no longer have it. Those who are sick and those with sick children and other family members are all too aware of the many difficulties facing this health system. Any parent would do anything within their power to ensure their child has the best care that will give them the best possible chance in life. Under our current system, there are so many examples of chronically under-funded and under-provided services. There are, sadly, so many areas in which sick children and adults are not given a chance at a healthy future. This must change but it appears, unfortunately, this is not a short-term priority for the current Government. Dar le rún Fhianna Fáil rinneadh maoiniú ró-íseal ar an gcóras sláinte. Is rud é seo gur féidir linn aontú air. Tar éis gur thosaigh Fianna Fáil na ciorruithe, choinnigh Fine Gael agus Páirtí an Lucht Oibre orthu ag ciorrú caiteachais atá riachtanach don tsláinte. D’fhág sin muid sa riocht ina bhfuilimid anois. The motion states, “the 2015 Health Service Executive National Service Plan is not sufficient to fully address the increasing demands and demographic pressures being placed on our hospital system”. This is a point I have made on several occasions over recent years, including when Fianna Fáil was in power. I feel that this oft-repeated fact will once again fall on deaf ears. There appears, again sadly, to be little recognition from the current Minister and the Government team that population demands on the service are increasing and need to be met. The motion then reads: “key targets in the Plan are regarded as unrealistic by its authors.” This is true. Authors of the plan itself recognise that some of its key targets are unrealistic. This is an indictment of the Health Service Executive and of the Government, in particular, regarding the manner in which plans are drawn up and promises are made when they know full well they will be unable to deliver on many of them. This recognition by the authors can be seen in the following passage from the service plan: “After many years of significant financial reductions, this additional resource will assist in the allocation of more realistic budgets enabling the health services to maintain the current levels of services.” Some hope in 2015, I fear. Fianna Fáil calls “on the Government to fund the health services appropriately and sufficiently in 2015”, something, of course, it failed to do during its later years of opportunity. I have previously described the HSE national service plan as wholly inadequate. There are now 50,000 outpatients on waiting lists for more than a year. There is nothing in this so-called national service plan that reassures me that these numbers can be significantly reduced in the short term. The fair deal continues to be under-provided for, leading to families stretched to breaking point and delayed discharges, yet this plan only offers the already announced €25 million. An extra 300 nursing home places will be provided for next year but there are currently 2,000 people who have been medically assessed as needing nursing home care and who are awaiting fair deal payment. The minor increase in numbers of doctors and nurses is undoubtedly necessary but the numbers mentioned only go a very small way towards addressing some of the most savage cuts in staff numbers in recent years. I note there are many unfilled GP places at present, including in my own constituency, with our qualified doctors opting to work abroad in many instances. This exodus, apart from the tragedy of it, is extremely expensive as it means we lose graduates who have received heavy State investment throughout their education. Many of the positive measures in the plan were already announced before the plan was presented. I have welcomed the additional €20 million funding for disability services but this is only a drop in the ocean. In Sinn Féin’s alternative budget, we would have provided an additional €31 million for these services, openly acknowledging, as I did, that even that would not be enough due to years of severe under-funding. Some €25 million is allocated for free GP care for children under six years of age, yet we still are not sure whether there will be a so-called "nominal" charge by GPs for this care. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, update us on this point?

The plan projects savings of €95 million next year in further medicine price reductions and reforms in the medicines procurement process. The plan does not, however, provide comprehensive detail of exactly how these savings would be realised. By the end of 2014, the top 20 medicines, by cost to the State, will be fully interchangeable, generic-for-branded medicines. When this occurs, further savings will become more difficult. I ask the Government to outline what specific medications will be targeted and in what way they will be targeted to ensure that further savings can be made. The Minister for Health has suggested that revised drug pricing agreements will be concluded with the representatives of the pharmaceutical industry - branded and generic - in Ireland at the start to the middle of 2015. In the past, these discussions have taken extended periods so I ask the Government to ensure these negotiations take place as a matter of urgency so savings can be made in 2015. In concluding, the Minister of State might advise when she expects them to conclude? We are told there can be savings from reform of the procurement of medicines. How exactly is this to happen? There are some additional measures that could also be looked at. The medications known as biosimilars, designed to replace some high-tech biologic medicines, are accepted as having the same safety and efficacy as biologics.This should be investigated as it could offer a significant saving. Changing from a branded medication to a generic medication is not recommended for someone with certain conditions such as epilepsy who is stable or transplant patients. I have vocally supported this time and again. However, could those who are newly diagnosed with such conditions start their treatment on generic medicines and then be maintained on them in the longer term? This approach could also reduce the spend on drugs and, very importantly, offer the same level of efficacy. The service plan fails to give much succour to those families dealing with mental health challenges. Budget 2015 laid out as a Government priority the development of community mental health services. While I welcome this aim, I note that little of substance has been provided to further it. It has been suggested more than 50% of the population suffer from some degree of mental ill health before the age of 25 years, which is a shocking statistic. This affects not only the individuals themselves but also the structures surrounding them. As in many other areas of the health system, mental health services have been grossly underfunded for many years. Budget 2015 told us nothing that would reassure us that major change was on the way. While funding increases might be hard to attain, there are many measures the HSE could introduce that would not rely solely on increased budgets. A Vision for Change was published in 2006 and so much has changed since. If it is not to be implemented in full soon, we will need a new road map for how we progress the further development of mental health services. We certainly need an urgent assessment of mental health services, including the NGO sector, and to examine how best to integrate it. I am contacted regularly by citizens from all across the State who have difficulty in seeking the appropriate care. I suggest there is an element of a postcode lottery in this respect. Citizens should be able to rely on quality services no matter where they live. I have said before the plan is being sold as adding an extra €625 million to the health spend next year, but of this €510 million represents the 2014 so-called overspend to be carried forward, leaving only an additional €115 million. Knowing the HSE's history, the likelihood is that much of this and more will be used to cover the cost of increased usage of the services that comes naturally with population demographics. Tacaím leis an rún. I will be supporting the motion.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	474	There is an effort by the Government to pretend that the appointment of Deputy Leo Varadkar as Minister for Health will somehow wipe the slate clean of the damage already done by it to the health service. This plan is part of that spin, but, in fact, we can see that some of the measures announced as part of the new national service plan were already announced and that the plan for 2015 is not enough to deal with increasing demands and a growing population who depend on hospitals. My constituency is a prime example of how the service has been run down in some cases and directly and savagely damaged in others. It is hard to even call it a health service when the HSE's own management data service report for September shows that there were 7,800 on Kerry County Hospital's waiting list, of whom an incredible 2,216 had been waiting for over six months, a further 654 had been waiting between one and two years and a further six had been waiting for longer than two years. When it gets to the stage where nearly 8,000 people are waiting to see a consultant, it shows that the system is dysfunctional. There is nothing in the plan that will reduce numbers significantly in the short term. Of course, I welcome the small increases in the numbers of doctors and nurses, but what has been announced will go only a very small way towards reversing some of the serious cuts in staff numbers in the past few years. The underfunding of Dingle and Kenmare community hospitals is an issue which is having a serious effect on the communities which depend on them. There are six hospital beds with no funding available to use them. Six beds are lying idle. That equates to six people who need a hospital bed, but who cannot get one because there is no funding available to service them.  Lip service is being paid to the need for early intervention for children with special needs. Everyone involved in the care of these children will testify to this, especially the parents. Children with special needs are being allocated SNAs for only half of their preschool hours, which means that parents have to take them out of school for the remaining period. An additional €20 million in funding for disability services has been announced, but this is very inadequate and will not fix the problems caused by successive cuts since 2008. Meanwhile, the Kerry Parents and Friends Association has had its funding cut by €44,000.  There has been a lot of publicity given to the new system for the issuing of medical cards, but meanwhile I have a constituent with terminal cancer who has to make do without one. I see this man every week walking the road and my daughter and I have contacted the Minister's office. The man had a discretionary medical card, but it was taken from him. He is terminally ill, but he is still denied a medical card. It is an absolute disgrace when somebody coming towards the end of his days has to do without a medical card because of the attitude taken by the Government. What is absolutely disgusting is that no reply has been received from the Minister's office. I have another constituent who has visited the accident and emergency department with severe headaches but who has been told he or she must wait 18 months to be seen by a consultant. These are real people who are being denied a basic right to a proper health service.  It does not matter how much the Government spins the figures. It is particularly misleading to suggest the so-called "extra" spend of €625 million is happening when €510 million of it will be used to cover the overspend this year. It is hard to watch while money is being spent on agency workers and basic services are suffering. Again, I go back to the practical experiences other Deputies and I have had with people who deserve a service. Will the Minister of State explain to me why somebody who is terminally ill and had a discretionary medical card until a number of months ago had it withdrawn? There is no explanation for it. The Minister's office did not even have the decency to issue a reply to explain why that was the case. I will send the facts to the Minister of State to see whether she will do something about it as the Minister has done absolutely nothing about it. I am looking at the man in question walking the road every week, knowing that his time is short and that he needs a medical card.

I also commend my colleague, Deputy Billy Kelleher, for bringing forward this excellent motion which hits the nail on the head in respect of three very important issues with which I will deal. The Government needs to wake up, listen and look at the real reform agenda needed in the health service and the urgent need to place patients at the top of the agenda. Let us look at the context and details of the motion. The health service is underfunded. The 2015 HSE national service plan is not sufficient to address fully the increasing demands and demographic pressures placed on the hospital system. The key targets set in the plan are regarded as unrealistic by its authors. We call on the Government to fund the health service appropriately and sufficiently in 2015. This will take leadership and tough decisions. Tax cuts while children are ill, senior citizens are lying on trolleys or people with disabilities are without a proper service should never be an option.That is the tough decision we must make on behalf of these people. We have to put our citizens first and the well-off further down the list. Of course, no Government will accept this or take the tough decisions in the interest of the patients. The reform agenda can be knocked down to a number of key issues. First, the Minister should allocate any extra money to accident and emergency departments to get senior citizens and sick patients off trolleys and into proper beds. The issue is a shortage of beds. Second, the Minister should focus on respite and residential care and providing adequate services for people with disabilities. I welcome that €20 million will be spent in this area but, as Deputy Ó Caoláin noted, we need between €30 million and €40 million. I welcome this debate and urge all Deputies to support Deputy Kelleher's motion.

Budget cuts have amounted to some €3.5 billion and almost 12,000 staff have been lost to the service. The situation would be much worse than is currently the case but for the health service's dedicated and committed staff. We should pay tribute to staff across all categories who go beyond the call of duty every hour of every day. Together with underfunding and lack of resources, demographic changes are exacerbating an already difficult situation for the health service. The population of those aged over 65 years is growing at double the EU rate and will increase by 20,000 people per year until 2021. The population of those aged between 80 and 84 years will have increased by 20,300 or 29% by 2021 and the population of those aged over 85 will increase by 26,800 or 46% in the same period. These demographic changes and the underfunding of the health service give rise to a number of issues. The number of patients being forced to wait on trolleys and in chairs in accident and emergency departments is increasing. This is an unacceptable practice which is reminiscent of Third World conditions, with a lack of privacy, inadequate facilities and, often, non-existent bathroom and toilet facilities. We need to set up community intervention teams who can carry out procedures on people in their homes so they do not require admission to hospital. The fair deal scheme needs to be properly funded. The waiting time of 15 weeks is simply too long and even the proposed 11 weeks is unacceptable. We also need community services, such as additional home care assistance and home help, as well as additional appliances. Elderly people are waiting significant lengths of time for chairs, walkers, beds and wheelchairs. The hospital I know best is South Tipperary General Hospital, which is a progressive facility that is almost regional in its scope. Despite cuts of almost one quarter of its budget and up to 200 staff, its activity levels have increased significantly and it is working at 120% capacity. The number of trolleys has increased from 750 in 2011 to 3,100 in 2013. We need additional beds, including step down beds. Twelve beds were promised at Our Lady's hospital in Cashel. We also need additional nursing and support staff in accident and emergency departments.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	477	I note the views expressed by the Fiscal Council in their update of their fiscal stance, and welcome their assessment that targeting a deficit of 2.7% of GDP could be considered conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management. With regard to the Council's assertion that Budget 2015 represents a 'missed opportunity' and further consolidation should have been implemented, our overarching fiscal goal has always been to reach a deficit below 3% of GDP in 2015.   On the basis of Budget forecasts, this will be achieved. While further consolidation would have improved the headline deficit figure, I have a number of other issues to consider such as social cohesion and the need to safeguard the ongoing economic recovery. I agree wholeheartedly with the Council's view that we need to break the pattern of boom and bust economics evident in the past. The fiscal framework, which this Government has put in place, will provide a valuable structure to guide fiscal policy over the coming years. However, there are a number of technical and timing issues relating to EU implementation of fiscal rules which need to be resolved. For example, the expenditure benchmark links growth in expenditure to the potential growth rate of the economy.  The updated Commission projections on potential growth, on which assessment with the benchmark would be based, were not available in advance of the Budget. As these estimates can display significant revisions, there was no solid basis to forecast assessed expenditure in the outer years. This limitation was specifically highlighted in the budgetary documentation. A fuller assessment will be contained in the SPU in April. With regard to the revenue forecasts not reflecting Government's intention to reduce the tax burden in coming years, I would strongly make the point that this is the correct approach to take. What is reflected in the budgetary arithmetic is what is being legislated for in the coming year. Budgets cannot be framed on the basis of general policy principles such as that to reduce the level of income tax in the future. These decisions will be taken on an annual basis taking account of the economic and fiscal situation at the time.

They are investment options into which the proceeds of certain pension arrangements can be invested on retirement. Under the "ARF option" individuals are entitled, subject to conditions, to take their retirement lump sum and, with the balance of their pension fund, either purchase an annuity, invest in an ARF or take the balance in cash subject to tax. Where the ARF route is chosen, beneficial ownership of the assets in the ARF vests in the individual.  ARFs are managed and held by Qualifying Fund Managers and any investment income or capital gains arising is exempt from tax while the funds are invested in the ARF. Distributions or drawdowns from the ARF by the beneficial owner are subject to income tax at the owner's marginal rate.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no requirement on Qualifying Fund Managers (QFMs) who hold and manage ARFs on behalf of individuals to make returns to Revenue in relation to the number of ARFs under management or the value of ARF assets held by them. I am further advised that, as the income tax take from actual drawdowns from ARFs forms part of the total income tax take and is not readily identifiable within that overall income tax yield, it is not possible to provide the data requested by the Deputy. Separate tax collection data is available on the tax paid by QFMs on imputed or notional distributions from ARFs and "vested" PRSAs. The deemed or imputed distribution arrangements were introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 to encourage drawdowns from ARFs and 'vested' PRSAs (to which the notional distribution arrangements were extended in Finance Act 2012) so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement. The imputed distribution arrangements, under which a percentage of the value of assets in an ARF or "vested" PRSA is deemed to be distributed each year (unless sums equivalent to that value are actually drawn down), are not intended to nor do they give rise to significant tax revenues as they do not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and 'vested' PRSAs which are taxed in the normal way. By way of indication, the amounts received by the Revenue Commissioners from tax paid on imputed distributions has averaged about €4 million per annum in the period 2007 to 2013.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	480	I would first of all say that I have not received any requests or proposal in relation to the VAT treatment of the Band Aid charity single. In Ireland charities are exempt from VAT, which means they do not have to charge VAT on the goods or services they supply, such as CDs, but in addition they cannot claim back the VAT charged on the costs associated with their charitable business. In this case, where a charity produces a CD and supplies it themselves, it will be exempt from VAT in Ireland. However, where a charity makes an arrangement with a CD distributor to supply the charity CD on their behalf, then the CD sales are liable to VAT at the 23% VAT rate.  The situation is different again in the case of electronically supplied music. Under the current rules which apply until 31 December 2014, supplies of music, including charity singles, within the EU are charged to VAT in the Member State of the supplier. In this case, if the Band Aid single is being supplied from the UK, UK VAT rules will apply to that sale. Supplies of electronically supplied music into Europe, for the most part, are made from Luxembourg, where the VAT charged on these sales is at the standard VAT rate applying in Luxembourg. From 1 January 2015 the place of supply for electronically supplied music, including charity singles, will be the place of the consumer, and as such sales of electronically supplied music to Irish consumers will be liable to Irish VAT. In all cases, the standard VAT rate is the VAT rate charged on CD and electronically supplied music. The VAT treatment of goods and services is guided by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. Other than where supplied by a person who is exempt from VAT, such as a charity, the VAT Directive does not make provision for exempting from VAT the supply of CDs or electronically supplied music, whether the supply is for charitable purposes or not.  With regard to the UK Government's press release agreeing "to waive VAT on sales of the Band Aid anniversary single", from a technical perspective, and given EU VAT constraints, it is not clear what specific arrangements are being proposed by the UK, nor what arrangements are in place between the Band Aid charity and the distributor of the charity single in this regard.

The latter two licences are rarely issued as a beer retailer's off-licence entitles the licence-holder to sell cider by retail for consumption off the premises, whilst a wine retailer's off-licence entitles the holder of the licence to sell 'sweets' by retail for consumption off the premises.   Liquor licences must be renewed annually. Each off-licence type costs €500 and the duty is charged presently on a standard, flat-fee basis. Therefore, a typical off-licence selling wine, sprits and beer will pay licence duty of €1,500 annually.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the amount of Corporation Tax collected by the State is published on the Commissioners' Statistics website http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/statistics/index.html under "Revenue Net Receipts by Taxhead on an Annual Basis". Sectoral analysis of these receipts, in so far as they are available, is also published on the same Revenue webpage under "Revenue Net Receipts by Sector".  Earlier years can be located at http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/statistics/index.html under Revenue Statistical Reports 1996-2012, in the "Total Revenue" chapter. Updates to these statistics will be published in due course.

It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the cost to the Exchequer of the main tax reliefs available to companies. The following table shows the estimated cost, on a straight line arithmetic basis, of - Section 766 Research and Development Credit;  - Section 486C 3 year Start up Relief;  - Section 291A Intangible Asset Relief;  - Section 285A accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment;YearResearch and Development CreditStart up ReliefIntangible Asset regimeEnergy efficientCapital Allowances -€m€m€m€m2009216.1n/a1.21.62010223.74.620.30.62011261.36.876.21.32012281.95.5108.01.0An estimated cost for Section 486B Renewable Energy Relief is not included to protect the confidentiality of the information of the relatively small number of taxpayers using this relief. The table does not show the cost of other Corporation Tax deductions such as normal capital allowances, losses, etc., as they would not generally be considered "write-offs", rather they are a standard part of the tax computation of most countries to calculate taxable income. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a sector specific breakdown of these reliefs is not readily available.

I would like to point the Deputy to a paper published on the website of the Department of Finance titled Effective Rates of Corporation Tax in Ireland: Technical Paper, April 2014, which comprehensively reviews the different methodologies that are used to calculate the effective rate of tax, and may be viewed at the following link: http://budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2015/Documents/Technical_Paper_Effective_Rates_Corporation_Tax_Ireland.pdf
 As there is no single internationally agreed method of measuring the effective rate of Corporation Tax, it is not possible to compile the information requested by the Deputy.  However, the Deputy may be interested to note a piece of work that was carried out by the Revenue Commissioners as part of the Economic Impact Assessment of Ireland's Corporation Tax Policy, which was published on Budget Day. The paper titled Corporation Tax A Note on the Context and Concentration of Payments, is essentially a profile of corporation tax payments. It contains comprehensive analysis of the different component elements of Ireland's corporation tax revenue including a breakdown of tax paid by sector, location and concentration levels (by companies and corporate groups) in the period 2008 through 2012 (as 2012 is the most recent tax year for which full tax returns information is available). This document can be viewed at the following link: http://budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2015/Documents/Corporation_Tax_Context_Concentration_Corporation_Tax_Payments_Revenue.pdf 
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	486	The issue of 'contracted production' and its impact on the Irish national accounts has recently gained some public comment. This phenomenon has been under observation for some time by staff of my Department. Indeed, the Economic and Fiscal Outlook that accompanied Budget 2015 contained a box on the issue to which the Deputy may wish to refer if he requires a detailed explanation of the impact of contracted production: (http://www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2015/Documents/141014%20Economic%20and%20Fiscal%20Outlook%20REV%202.pdf). However, it is important to stress that the contribution of contracted production to growth cannot be calculated with precision with the publicly available data to hand. It should be recalled that large movements in GDP relating to activities of the foreign-owned sector in Ireland are not new. Foreign-owned firms are generally large, high-turnover enterprises concentrated in certain sectors. As such firm-specific and product-specific developments can have a bearing on measured GDP. Notwithstanding these developments relating to contracted production, there is no doubt that economic recovery has gained momentum this year and that it has broadened to include a recovery in domestic demand.  High-frequency data such as retail sales, industrial production and purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) are all in strong positive territory. Employment growth resumed in 2012 and the Live Register continues to fall month-on-month. This recovery has manifested itself in tax revenues which are expected to come in €1 billion (or 2.5 per cent) above original expectations.  Returning to the issue of contracted production, it should be recalled that it involves very little employment effect or second-round impact on the wider economy and complicates the task of forecasting net exports. As developments are sector-specific and product-specific they have the potential to unwind or accelerate with potentially large impacts on measured GDP. National accounts estimates for the third quarter of this year are due for publication in mid-December and will show the most recent developments in contracted production.
