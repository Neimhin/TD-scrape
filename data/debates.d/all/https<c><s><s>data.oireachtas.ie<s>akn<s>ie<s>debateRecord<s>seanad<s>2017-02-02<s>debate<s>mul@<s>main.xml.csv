#BillyLawless	unknown-#BillyLawless-party	unknown-#BillyLawless-dob	unknown-#BillyLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	1	I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for selecting this important matter. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe McHugh, to discuss it. I take my appointment as Ireland’s first emigrant Senator seriously. That mandate extends not only to the diaspora in the United States, with whom I am more familiar, but also to the diaspora across the globe. One issue which comes up time and again with elderly members of the diaspora in the United Kingdom is continued access to RTE's long wave radio service which is set to be abolished at some point in 2017. There may be many young or more digitally orientated people in RTE management who may scoff at the notion of retaining for what for them may be a feature of bygone era. However, this narrow thinking does not understand the richness RTE provides for the tens of thousands of listeners in the United Kingdom who tune into its long wave service every single day. There are more than 600,000 Irish-born emigrants living in the United Kingdom. Many of their older members were forced out of Ireland in the 1950s with little education and no prospects of finding work at home. In January 2016 the Social Policy Research Centre at Middlesex University in London, funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, conducted a study of emigrants’ usage of RTE's long wave service. Up to 92% of respondents stated they listened to it every day or most days, with 44% listening to it in the car or another vehicle. Less than half of the respondents had used a television or some digital device to access the radio service. Unsurprisingly, it was the so-called older age groups who did not access the service on digital radio platforms on a laptop or digital TV. Will the Minister of State consider the findings of the survey, given that it was funded by the previous Government, and implore RTE management to reconsider this ageist and discriminatory cutting of RTE's long wave service planned for 2017? Nobody is trying to halt the digitalisation of the media or impede RTE in its process of modernisation. However, it must be reminded of its public service remit. The historic first state visit of Uachtarán na hÉireann to the United Kingdom in 2014 was an incredible moment for the Irish community living in the United Kingdom, particularly its elderly members who had been through difficult times for the Irish during the Troubles.Anyone who watched the concerts and events held to mark the President's visit could see that they reconnected many Irish men and women from humble economic and social backgrounds in a way that had not been done for many generations. It was an extremely proud moment, not just for these immigrants but also for the diaspora throughout the world. It showed that the nation was wider than its borders. I ask the Minister of State what message is sent to the people concerned when three years later the switch is turned off on RTE's long wave radio service which is the daily and perhaps only link for so many with home. Thankfully, we have exited the period of austerity. It seems to be an extremely harsh and unfair decision for RTE to directly target some of the most elderly and vulnerable people who use its services. This is not what public service broadcasting is supposed to be about.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	2	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir as an gceist tábhachtach seo a chur faoin tseirbhís thar a bheith tábhachtach ar son muintir na hÉireann sa Bhreatain.  By way of background, in September 2014, RTE announced plans to shut down its longwave 252 service, which enables RTE Radio 1 to be broadcast into Britain. While the initial plan was for the longwave 252 service to close on 27 October 2014, it was further deferred until 19 January 2015. On 18 December 2014 a decision was taken to continue long wave radio services until 2017. Following this announcement, the Government’s emigrant support programme which is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade supported research into listenership figures in Britain for RTE's longwave 252 service. The purpose of the research was to obtain concrete data for the current listenership and also to explore the possibility of continuing the service using alternate technologies. The research was conducted by the Social Policy Research Centre at Middlesex University which was appointed following a competitive tender process run by Irish in Britain, the national representative organisation for the Irish community in England, Scotland and Wales. Information was gathered through individual and group submissions and focus groups. Overseeing the research was a consultative group of key stakeholders which was composed of representatives of RTE, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials based in Dublin and at the Embassy of Ireland in London and representatives of the Irish community in Britain. The figures show that of 3,191 people who completed the individual surveys, 72% of those who responded were over 60 years, 68% of respondents were born in Ireland, while 62% were retired. For the majority of respondents, the long wave service was seen as a lifeline to Ireland, helping them to maintain a sense of Irishness and keep up with events back home. The majority of listeners in the focus groups preferred the familiar, analogue service, as opposed to digital platforms, computers, laptops and smartphones. The Government recognises the special value placed on RTE's longwave 252 service by some Irish citizens in Britain, especially the elderly, and my Department is working closely with RTE to ensure the views of this community are heard in any decision-making process. While any decision on the future of long wave services in Britain is ultimately an operational matter for RTE, it can, as a result of the study, now be informed by awareness of the role the service plays in preserving and enhancing links with Ireland and keeping Irish people living in Britain informed of important events and developments such as the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union and the Irish Government’s position. A meeting of the consultative group will take place in London next week in order to discuss the next steps to be taken, explore possible ways forward In the context of maintaining the link with audiences in Britain and keeping the Irish community involved in decision-making. I am hopeful a positive outcome can be achieved.

That is very encouraging and I am sure my colleagues will be more than happy with his response. It is vital that we look after the elderly, not just those living in the United Kingdom but also in the United States. The Irish emigrant population are getting older and need these links.

It also continues at a political level in the US Senate and House of Representatives. The Senator is involved in that effort. He took part in a very important meeting in America on 12 January. The meetings with the consulates and the embassy are so important. In the context of what we can control in terms of the budget, €2.3 million was allocated as part of last year's programme to the emigrant support service. We support many emigrant support services, be they in San Diego, San Francisco, Boston or New York, and we need to continue that support. We also need to continue work to maintain our strong relationship with the United States. When the Taoiseach travels to the White House on 17 March, it is going to be about that relationship. Foremost in the mind of every politician, including my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who is in the United States this week, are the undocumented. It is a top priority and will continue to be. It was my priority when I was in San Francisco, New York and Boston. I am due to go again - the Senator will be joining me- to visit the the east coast and we have to make it a priority because there are people who feel vulnerable. We have to ensure the relationship between Ireland and the United States will continue, in a similar vein to the Senator's comments on the relationship with the United Kingdom. They are two separate issues but one and the same in keeping relationships strong.

The next matter is in the names of Senators Catherine Noone and Gabrielle McFadden. As Senator Gabrielle McFadden is not present, Senator Catherine Noone may have to go it alone.
#CatherineNoone	unknown-#CatherineNoone-party	unknown-#CatherineNoone-dob	unknown-#CatherineNoone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	11	I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  The motion speaks for itself and relates to the high cost of car parking in many public hospitals, especially for long-term patients. I wish to ask the Minister of State if the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, will consider providing car parking guidelines for hospitals or the private companies that run hospital car parks in an effort to reduce the cost for patients with a long-term illness and their families. The exorbitant cost of hospital car parking across the country needs to be addressed. I was dismayed to hear about the wife of a cancer patient who had been forced to fork out €1,200 in hospital car parking charges at Beaumont Hospital over a six month period. A three-hour stay in the car park at Tallaght Hospital costs €7.50. This is almost twice what shoppers pay at the Square shopping centre which is a stone's throw from the hospital and which clearly has a similar value of real estate. According to a recent report by the Irish Cancer Society, Dublin hospitals are the most expensive, which is logical in a sense owing to real estate prices, etc. A four-hour stay at one of these hospitals costs €8.86 on average. At hospitals in Munster a four-hour stay costs approximately €6.70 on average. This has a huge effect on people's lives at a time when they are extremely vulnerable. Meanwhile, only seven of the 27 cancer treatment hospitals offer weekly discounted car parking rates. Recently Age Action researched and produced a report on the experiences of older people attending outpatient services at University Hospital Galway. Some 68% of respondents said they found car parking charges excessive. Paying such high rates on a regular basis adds financial pressure on families and patients who are already under significant physical and psychological stress. Although a discounted car parking rate is offered to relatives of long-term patients in some hospitals, this is not enough. As a result, I am calling for the issuing of car parking guidelines, similar to those issued by the NHS in the United Kingdom, in order to reduce and streamline the cost of parking for patients with a long-term illness and their families. I am well aware that, in many instances, private companies run the car parks.We can introduce a policy that would affect them by implementing some regulation or at least guidelines to help families who find themselves in this situation. Hospitals or the companies that are allowed to franchise out or rent the land should not profit hugely at the expense of patients who are in long-term care services, in particular.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	12	As the Senator can see, I am not the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris. I am here on his behalf.  In the past decade parking charges have been introduced at many hospitals. It is important to note that they are part of the series of measures which ensure the operational cost of providing parking services does not cause an adverse impact on their budgets. As demand for parking services at hospitals increases, so too does the associated cost of providing them such as the initial capital cost of purchasing or renting parking areas, the cost of developing extra parking spaces, the need to provide and upgrade security schemes in hospital car parks, the cost of staffing and general maintenance of parking services. The cost of providing these services needs to be recouped and I am sure we will all agree that the cost of providing them for visitors, staff and patients should not impact on a hospital's budget to provide health care services for patients. The Health Service Executive, HSE, has advised that it does not have a single contract to provide parking services at all hospitals. Instead each hospital has a unique arrangement which reflects its specific circumstances. For example, Temple Street Children's University Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and Mercy University Hospital in Cork do not provide public car parking spaces. Furthermore, some hospitals such as St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar, Merlin Park University Hospital in Galway and Mallow General Hospital do not have a charge for parking a car. There is free parking. The HSE advises that a number of hospitals use parking revenue solely for maintenance and reinvestment in parking facilities, including repayment of loans obtained for upgrading such facilities and investing in security. The remainder of hospitals use parking revenue to cover the cost of parking services, with any additional income contributing to the general hospital budget or funding research or specific patient facilities. The Minister is aware that those hospitals which charge parking fees are very conscious of the financial impact of parking costs on patients and their families, particularly those with a long-term illness. Consequently, the hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge and thus have capped these expenses. While there is no national HSE policy covering car parking charges, the executive advises the Minister that it keeps hospital parking charges under review. We must take into account public transport services when considering further development of the hospital system. This is evidenced by planning and development and support for the expansion of public transport facilities, especially for the new national children's hospital. We continue to provide more transport choices for the public when visiting their loved ones in hospitals.

I understand, as she said, that she is not actually the Minister. I refer to recouping costs, which obviously has to be part of the overall picture. There will be security costs and it is important that facilities be maintained. I anticipated the answer I have received because I said I knew that the HSE was going to state it did not actually manage hospitals. I have to take the answer at face value. What I would like and request from the Department is an outline of what is being charged at a discount rate at hospitals. It is stated in the reply that hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge, thus capping the expense incurred. I am aware of this, but I am not aware if it happens at all hospitals. I would definitely like to see such a system in place and also what it means in real terms for the families of patients. I will follow up separately with the Department in that regard. I request the HSE and the Minister who is in charge of everything related to health care to do everything to ensure the private companies which are in operation in hospitals will be given guidelines or regulations to ensure people will not be charged an excessive amount when their loved ones are in hospital.

I, too, have concerns about the charges levied at hospitals. However, there are some hospitals at which there is a maximum price. I can only refer to Tallaght Hospital which charges €10 to park for 24 hours, while St. James's Hospital and hospitals in Cork and Limerick charge €15. The sum of €1,200 is an exorbitant amount to ask anyone to pay when people are very sick. I know on a personal level - I have been in this position - that when my brother was very seriously ill in Tallaght Hospital last year - he later died - arrangements were made with the family to enable his eight children to visit him on a frequent basis. The hospital was very co-operative in providing parking facilities for them at a very low rate because they were with him 24/7 for at least three weeks. There are ways by which hospitals can look at the issue. What the Senator said is very relevant to some of the experiences I have had with the HSE in not having proper guidelines for hospitals. I will raise that issue with the Minister.
#MariaByrne	unknown-#MariaByrne-party	unknown-#MariaByrne-dob	unknown-#MariaByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	15	Last week when the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, was in the Chamber, he referred to the budget for this year, €14.6 billion, as being the highest ever. He also referred to the distress of patients and that of their families and the impact on staff of cramped and overcrowded conditions and high numbers of patients on trolleys. University Hospital Limerick has been to the forefront in media coverage for quite a while in having the highest number of patients on trolleys and because of overcrowding in the emergency department. I am aware that the new emergency department at the hospital is due to open in May 2017. The go-ahead was also received last week to proceed to design stage for the provision of 96 acute beds. At the same time this application was submitted, St. John's Hospital in Limerick which is part of the University of Limerick Hospital Group made an application for the replacement of 90 beds in the city centre. There are 99 beds in the hospital, ten of which are for patients in need of medical procedures, while ten are for day care patients. St. John's Hospital was built in 1780 as a fever and lock hospital. It is the second oldest hospital in the country, after the Rotunda Hospital which is still on the original site. The application was included as part of the University of Limerick Hospital Group's application to the national capital development fund. Both applications were put on a priority list at the same time. To solve the problem with waiting lists and of overcrowding at the emergency department in University Hospital Limerick, we need to expedite the application at the same time as the application to provide 96 beds at the hospital. If the replacement beds are provided at St. John's Hospital, it will be possible to expand services. Some services currently operate from prefabs. The hospital has been struggling for a while to provide services both for staff and patients in a safe manner. The staff have certainly done their very best. The services are renowned and I compliment all involved who work in them. Because he visited the hospital recently and saw what was happening at first hand, the Minister of State is aware of the shortage and the problems being faced.It is not just for the people of Limerick; it is also for the people of the mid-west because it is the main hospital. If the two applications could be put forward at the same time, it would help to expand services and create extra beds. It would also help to reduce waiting lists if more beds were available for day-care procedures in different services. It is mainly medical, gynaecological and general medical assessments that are carried out. There is also an injuries assessment unit. They are the main services provided in the hospital. It would also lead to job creation because of the proposed expansion. If the two applications could proceed in tandem, it would be great.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	16	The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, apologises for not being here.  I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter. A number of projects have been identified by the University of Limerick Hospital Group for further development. These include a proposal for a 96-bed ward block at University Hospital Limerick on the Dooradoyle campus and a 90-bed replacement ward block at St. John's Hospital in Limerick city. It will be necessary to prioritise these projects in a national context. It is important to note that a number of construction projects are under way at University Hospital Limerick. Acute hospital campuses are complex sites and all construction must be carefully planned and scheduled to ensure patient care is not impeded or unnecessarily impacted on. In the 2017 national service plan the HSE has outlined a number of projects which are expected to be completed and become operational in 2017 or early 2018. In particular, the opening of the new emergency department at University Hospital Limerick has been identified as a priority in the 2017 service plan. The Minister has confirmed that an additional €1.4 million has been allocated to facilitate the opening of the new emergency department later this year. The new facility will triple the size of the emergency department and immeasurably improve the experience of patients in terms of comfort, privacy and dignity. The new emergency department is being fitted out and recruitment of the additional staff required for the enlarged facility is ongoing. The acute medical assessment unit and outpatient department are being refurbished and reconfigured to provide eight additional assessment places and 12 replacement assessment spaces. In addition, a surgical and pre-operative assessment unit is projected to open in the third quarter of 2017 and will provide 14 additional assessment spaces. I also note that the clinical education and research centre which is co-funded by the University of Limerick is projected to be operational by the fourth quarter of 2017. It has an estimated capital cost of €12.9 million.  These projects demonstrate the considerable investment in infrastructure which is under way on the University Hospital Limerick campus and which will benefit the wider hospital group. The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for infrastructural development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs. The reality is that limited funding is available for new projects in the multi-annual period from 2016 to 2021, given the level of commitments in place and the costs of completion of projects under way. Further investment in the University of Limerick Hospital group must, therefore, be considered within the overall acute hospital sector infrastructure programme and the overall capital envelope available to the health service. The House is aware that a proposed mid-term review of the State's capital envelope will assess progress and review emerging pressures and demands. It is expected that the mid-term review will be completed in 2017. The Department of Health will work with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to conduct the review of the capital programme. The Department of Health will also conduct a bed capacity review which will assess projected health care needs in the next decade and the associated infrastructural requirements to meet these needs.

If the plan for the provision of 90 replacement beds could proceed to the design stage at the same time as the design stage for the provision of the 96 acute beds, it would be very helpful for the region. There is a shortage of funding, but I am sure the funding will come down the line as things begin to improve. If the project could be considered to proceed to design stage as part of the mid-term review, it would be very positive because the two applications need to be worked together to resolve the issue in Limerick.

I will raise the issue of capital funding and the mid-term review with the Minister. I will repeat the Senator's point that the 90 replacement beds should be put into service within a certain amount of time. I will add to what the Senator said at the beginning. The Government has provided the largest ever health care budget. There are patients still waiting on trolleys but not in the significant numbers before Christmas. It causes considerable concern for families when loved ones are left in emergency departments on trolleys for longer than is required. I will raise these issues with the Minister and assure the Senator that he will do anything in his power, provided the budget is available, to make sure replacement hospital beds will be in place as soon as possible.

#JoanFreeman	unknown-#JoanFreeman-party	unknown-#JoanFreeman-dob	unknown-#JoanFreeman-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	24	I have a sense of déjà vu that I have been here before and asked the same questions. I find it a little upsetting that the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is not here because all of the requests I have made to meet her have been completely ignored. She promised to set up a meeting, but she has not done so. I will tell the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, in a nutshell what the problem is. I launched a project, Project 95, to address the fact that 95 children had been placed in adult psychiatric units in 2015. The traumatic effect it had on children was astounding. One can imagine how upsetting it is for a child to be placed in an ordinary ward for the treatment of physical health problem, but imagine what it must be like for him or her to be placed in an adult psychiatric ward. The Minister of State, Deputy Heln McEntee, is well aware of this issue as we have spoken at length about it on many occasions. It is no good to just highlight the issue. The media have highlighted it every single year. I have come up with a solution, yet the Minister of State continues to ignore it.  The solution is to have a collaborative working relationship between the public and private sectors. The private sector has beds available. It has psychiatric intensive care units, PICUs, for children who are in terrible distress and they are available at weekends. The public sector does not have anything available. All it would take is a series of conversations between the public and private sectors. It would reduce overnight the number of children who have to be placed in adult psychiatric units and also reduce the number of children - 2,500 - who are waiting to be seen and assessed by the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. They cannot be seen and assisted by it mainly because the services do not have the personnel available because they are overwhelmed by the numbers. The private sector could jump in on a short-term basis and carry out assessments. Most of the children do not need CAMHS; rather, they need to be redirected to somewhere like Pieta House or Barnardos or one of the other organisations.The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, still refuses to consider the issue. What is tragic is that she and her Department are completely ignoring the fact that there are children on the waiting list with life-threatening issues. They are either starving to death because they are anorexic or they have strong suicidal ideation. For example, there were three young people in Cork who killed themselves just before Christmas. It has been suggested that if there was an out-of-hours service availabe, they would still be alive today. Can the Minister of State imagine not only the Christmas those families experienced but also what the year ahead will be like for them? There is another issue I want to address with the Minister of State. I wonder how much of this will get to her ears and if she will address us. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is in the Chamber listening, but will the Minister of State with responsibility for this issue listen? I publicly asked about the allocation of funding the last time she was in the Chamber. How was the money spent? There is €35 million meant to be given every year under A Vision for Change. How was the money spent last year? More importantly, in the budget the Government indicated that there was another €35 million available under A Vision for Change, but very quietly it was let out that it would happen over two years. There is €15 million available this year. As I stated to the Minister of State at the time, it will act as a stop-gap or contingency fund to meet the inadequacies of the budget, but it will not be used to provide any direct support or services. Where and how will the €15 million be allocated? Last year I had to publicly go with the 95 Project and ask the public to be aware of the chronic and disgraceful treatment of the children of the nation. I was recently advised that I was not angry enough or that my tone was not angry enough.

I have been asked to take this matter and I am happy to do so.  In the period from 2012 to 2016, approximately €115 million was added to the Health Service Executive mental health budget, which totalled €826 million in 2016. This represents an increase of €41 million, or 5.2%, on the figure provided in 2015. A Programme for a Partnership Government gives a clear commitment to increasing the mental health budget annually, as resources allow, to expand existing services. Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional €35 million for services to be initiated in 2017. Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 service plan include youth mental health; further improvements to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and adult services; older people’s services; and a further enhanced out-of-hours response for those in need of urgent services. Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be approximately €15 million. There will also be an additional spend of €9.5 million in mental health services associated with increased pay rates. Details of the 2017 development money spending will be finalised with the HSE in the near future in the context of the 2017 HSE mental health division’s operational plan for 2017. For 2016 an additional €35 million in programme for Government funding was allocated for mental health services. This funding was spent on national mental health priorities as agreed between the Department of Health and the HSE and as signalled in the HSE's 2016 national service plan. Funding was issued in three parts. The first part, totalling approximately €22 million, was issued in June 2016 and used to fund such areas as homeless mental health services, service user engagement, the Jigsaw programme, the provision of additional counselling and psychology services and eating disorder posts. The second part, totalling €12 million, was issued in August 2016 and used to fund minor and capital works which addressed difficulties identified by Mental Health Commission inspectors, as well as an increase in the number of psychiatric nurse undergraduate training places. The final €1 million was allocated in December 2016 and helped to fund replacement vehicles for residential mental health units and mental health work by organisations such as Bodywhys, Áras Folláin, ADD Ireland and Focus Ireland. In cases where the HSE was unable to spend the full amount allocated to a certain area in 2016, it was reallocated to other mental health areas following sanction from the Department of Health. For example, €5 million issued for mental health services in the area of primary care was used to expand the range of small and minor capital works. Mental health priorities for 2016 were agreed between the Department of Health and the HSE. They were published in the HSE's 2016 national service plan and in more detail in the HSE mental health division's 2016 operational plan. The breakdown of all mental health funding is available in the HSE mental health division’s operational plan which is published annually. The 2016 spend on these areas will be included in the forthcoming 2017 operational plan.

I know that she is reading the answer given to her by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, but I have heard it all before. It is sad that I have come to realise the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, has gone to the same school of language to which the Government and the HSE have gone. They have learned beautifully and effectively to fudge, placate and talk in circles. Every time I ask a question I hear that nonsense and it is nonsense. I am asking three very simple questions. I left my house at 7.30 a.m. to be here on time and prepared. I expected to meet the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee. As usual, I have seen the can being kicked down the street and a fudging of the real issues. I want answers to these three questions. What will the Minister of State do to prevent another 100 children from entering adult psychiatric units this year? What will she do about facilitating a meeting between the public and private sectors to erase all of these issues? How was the money spent last year and how does the Minister of State intend to spend the €15 million allocated this year? I want this said to her as soon as possible.

The matter has the heading of transparency in mental health budget allocations and whether the Minister of State will agree to disclose where resources have been allocated since October 2016. In many ways, the response outlines how the funding was spent. I assure the Senator that, on any business I take here on behalf of a Minister or a Minister of State, I personally speak to them about the questions raised. It would be wrong to think I do not do so as I personally convey the issues raised. When I take a Topical Issues matter in the Dáil, I always speak to the relevant Minister or Ministers afterwards. I agree with the Senator on a fundamental matter. I welcome the extra funding for CAMHS as, like any other public representative, I hear from many parents with a difficulty in gaining access to CAMHS for their children. I have come across a few disturbing cases. It is welcome there is money available in that regard. The Senator mentioned her Project 95. Although I have no knowledge of it, I will enlighten myself about it afterwards. What she has said is very true and honest and I will not argue with her. It is unacceptable that children and particularly young adults are housed in an adult ward when they have serious mental issues, including eating disorders.  I will personally bring the Senator's very clear messages to the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee. I will relay to her the Senator's disappointment that she was not here and, above all, the fact that the Senator requested a meeting which not take place. I will bring these serious concerns to her.

Last week I raised serious concerns about the threat of a hard Brexit and the serious effect it would have on the economy. Yesterday MPs at Westminster voted to invoke Article 50. A hard Brexit is no longer a threat but a reality. To compound the severity of this development, earlier in the week the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, stated there would be no special status for Northern Ireland. This means that the likelihood of a hard border on this island has become far more plausible. Mr. Brokenshire's comments are of particular concern owing to the unique position of Northern Ireland. It is the only part of the United Kingdom that has a land border with the European Union. This, with the fact that the region voted strongly to remain part of the European Union, means that special arrangements must be put in place. Even the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, when in Dublin last week, acknowledged Northern Ireland's special position and pledged that there would be no return to the borders of the past. Having said that, the lack of any plan for how this would be achieved is a serious concern. That the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland appears to be echoing the language of the DUP is frustrating. Adding to the difficulty is the cynical manoeuvring of Sinn Féin in the context of Brexit and the instability brought to Northern Ireland by the collapsing of the Northern Ireland Executive. Our focus should be on dealing with the real and serious risks facing Northern Ireland, rather than seeking to use the issue to advance other larger constitutional arguments. Brexit is going to take a greater social and economic toll on Northern Ireland than on anywhere else in the United Kingdom. Given that it is taking place against the express wishes of the people of Northern Ireland, we need to see a far more constructive approach from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The second issue I wish to raise relates to the challenges facing the capital in terms of transport and infrastructure and the resulting daily ordeal many of us face in getting to and from our place of work. Unfortunately, since the economic downturn many of the capital's projects have been delayed or shelved – the same applies to projects throughout the country. In the capital metro north has been delayed, while the DART underground project appears to be rather uncertain. I welcome the continuing development of the Luas cross-city line. I hope that, when completed, it will be a convenient addition to the transport services for those living in Dublin. Yesterday, however, I read with concern an article in The Irish Times which stated the future of the DART underground project was in serious jeopardy as a result of the Government failing to provide funding for Iarnród Éireann for the rail line and a critical site for the development of the project on Pearse Street. As many in the House will know, the proposed 7.5 km line would link the northern line with the Heuston main line, with new underground stations at the docklands, Pearse Street, St. Stephen's Green and Christchurch, as well as a surface station in Inchicore. The business case put forward by Iarnród Éireann outlined how the project would provide an efficient and environmentally sustainable alternative to road transport. Moreover, it would provide the capacity to enable growth within an otherwise constrained city centre. The cost benefit analysis arising from the report indicated that the project also offered high value for money. When I read that a project of this importance was in jeopardy, it reinforced my belief in the need to have one person with responsibility for Dublin. Again, I reiterate the calls made by my party colleague, Deputy John Lahart, and others for the establishment of an office of Dublin mayor. We have to look to the future and at the quality of life for citizens living in a badly congested city. Where is the Government's vision for the capital? How bad will traffic congestion have to become before the Government realises it must work to deliver capital investment projects such as the DART underground project, metro north and the underground expansion of the Luas? I call on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to clarify the Government's position on the DART underground project and publish five, ten and 20-year plans for the infrastructure of the capital.

First, I welcome the ruling of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom on the flag protests that continued for months and that affected people living on the Short Strand. Unfortunately, the PSNI chose not to stop the protest marches passing through. I am pleased that the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom found that the police service had the power to stop them and that it should have done so. I commend the residents of the Short Strand in Belfast. They courageously pursued the case through the courts, all the way to the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom, to win the particular battle. I hope this will marks a step change because we need such a change. Everyone in the Chamber wants to see fair policing in the North. The Supreme Court in the United Kingdom has found that fair policing did not apply. As a result, people suffered for months. I hope this is a sign of a step change in policing within the Six Counties. Senator Catherine Ardagh made certain remarks about Sinn Féin. We are proud of our record in the North where we stand for election. Ours is a 32-county party and we welcome competition at any stage. We want to talk about a united Ireland, for which we will never apologise. The next point I want to raise relates to the US President, Mr. Trump, about whom I know a good deal has been said. One aspect of particular concern relates to Palestine. President Trump has signalled strongly that he intends to move the US embassy to Jerusalem. That is particularly concerning. We now have people high up in the Israeli Government saying there is no longer any need to even talk about the need for a Palestinian state. This has serious repercussions for the people of Palestine and is yet another reason to be concerned. As a party, we recognise that we should not be breaking the links built by all parties in America. We understand the relationship is important. However, I have concerns about the optics of the Taoiseach potentially fawning over President Trump with a bowl of shamrock. It is up to the Taoiseach to make it clear that he is entirely opposed to the horrendous, racist and misogynist policies of President Trump. We can do something on the topic in the Chamber this evening. A protest will take place at 6 p.m. in Shannon organised by Shannonwatch.I invite any of our colleagues close by to come down and join me at 6 p.m. To be frank, it is one thing to talk about President Trump, but we will have an opportunity at Shannon Airport at 6 p.m. today to stand for equality and with our Muslim brothers and sisters. I hope we will have a good turnout.

The picket stems from the frustration felt within the industry across the country but most particularly in Dublin because of the total inaction of the Irish Greyhound Board on the issue of the future of the Harold's Cross track. The Indecon report published in 2014 showed that, under the board, the Irish greyhound industry was in debt to the tune of €21 million. It found that the board was challenged and flawed on a number of fronts, including financial governance, doping and performance procedures. It also found that the financial system in place was flawed. For that reason, it came up with a number of proposals, one of which was that the Harold's Cross track be sold in anticipation of the zoning being changed from amenity to development land in the Dublin development plan. Local councillors, some from within the Labour Party, I am glad to say, saw off this proposal and the Harold's Cross track was retained as an amenity, thereby reducing the value of the land. Despite this, the only action the Irish Greyhound Board has come up with to date to address its €21 million debt involves the selling of the Harold's Cross track. The board has squandered and wasted money for the past 20 years. In one instance, it spent millions in developing a new track in Limerick, but it failed to sell the old track. It has also failed dismally to grow the industry because it has not dealt with the problem of doping. I congratulate everyone who was in Clonmel for the coursing meetings on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. There is horse racing meeting there today. The people I met had lost faith in the industry. I ask that the legislation promised since 2015 to deal with the recommendations made in the Indecon report be brought forward and also that the new interim CEO, Dr. Seán Brady, meet the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association, something he has refused to do to date. In addition, will the Leader find out how long the interim period will be and when a new CEO will be put in place? The last CEO left overnight. It is very important for a State board that a CEO be appointed properly. I want to raise one other brief issue.

In the Dáil the Minister said he welcomed the Bill in which he saw merit. Unfortunately, the people who suffer from epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, arthritis and fibromyalgia, of which I have been a sufferer for 20 years, have seen no progress made on the Bill. Some 1.6 million people in this country suffer from chronic pain. From a survey taken in the last week, it has now been accepted by GPs across the country that medicinal cannabis, properly dispensed with a prescription, properly controlled and produced in synthetic form to remove its damaging properties, would be good for patients and help to reduce the numbers of painkillers, sleeping tablets, antidepressants and morphine patches those suffering from these ailments have to endure every day. I ask the Minister to bring forward the legislation as soon as possible. I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his tolerance.

We need a solution for Ireland that is unique. We need a solution that will allow an all-Ireland customs union. That would effectively mean that there would not be a hard border and that we would need controls at ports rather than along the Border with Northern Ireland. We need a special and unique solution. Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have to be treated within the negotiations as very special territory. I ask the Leader to express that view, given that we are in a very difficult situation. I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the interim, as Brexit moves closer to become a reality, given the huge threat to the agriculture sector, particularly those engaged in intensive farming. In counties such as Cavan and Monaghan and other areas along the Border employment in the industry, particularly in the mushroom sector, is at huge risk. A system of supports will have to introduced, including tax incentives. I, therefore, ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue. I support Senator Catherine Ardagh who raised the issue at the outset in order for it to be given high priority. Brexit is the big matter today and the Leader should respond accordingly. While it is admirable to engage in constant review and debate in the House, I agree with Senator Catherine Ardagh that a special and serious debate is required, with particular reference to the impact of a hard Brexit along the Border. I appreciate the indulgence of the House as this is an extremely serious issue for the constituency I represent.

It is going to be a long-term problem for Ireland. While travelling here in my car this morning, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, was on RTE radio speaking about rural Ireland and his Ireland 2040 plan. In the past few months many Senators have mentioned that we have a two-tier recovery. Dublin is glowing. There seems to be a lot of employment and, as Senator Catherine Ardagh said, there is massive traffic congestion. However, rural Ireland has been forgotten. When one looks at health services, schools, shops and post offices or at main streets and town centres, it is clear that it is very difficult for them to remain attractive for businesses. It is also difficult for people to live and work in rural Ireland. It is a 23-year plan and the Minister said this morning that public meetings would be held in various areas to discuss it. If people want to know something these days, they turn on RTE radio and they will hear all of the information the Minister and the Taoiseach are launching. In 2002 - 15 years ago - there was a national spatial strategy which I am sure some Members will remember.

We are a far cry from where we were ten, 15 or 20 years ago, when if we went abroad, we were afraid to even look at a phone, never mind use it for fear of incurring charges running into hundreds of euro. It is one very positive thing the European Union has delivered. By 15 June an SMS will cost 1 cent and people will be able to use their phones as though they were in Ireland. I want to mention a recent documentary broadcast on RTE which many of us will have seen about the use of drugs, prescription drugs in particular but also other drugs with codeine. I felt the documentary, while it was very enlightening and interesting, was slightly anecdotal and lacked a little balance when it came to mental illness, in particular. There are over 450,000 people in Ireland who are on anti-depressants and we cannot underestimate how vital and perhaps life changing these drugs are in many instances. It must be said a review of the issue would be very useful for the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to implement. If the figures are as stark and worrying as was highlighted in the documentary, we need to be implementing a more structured counselling service in order that general practitioners and other medical professionals can safely recommend and prescribe counselling in certain instances. That is not to take from - I cannot stress this enough and I am repeating it - how important and vital these drugs are for some people who have mental illnesses. I do not think that balance came across in the documentary. I call on the Minister for Health to investigate the use of prescription medications in addressing mental health issues nationwide to avoid over and erroneous prescription.

It has been approved by the World Health Organization. Currently, only one medication has been approved for use as PrEP which is marketed under the name of Truvada and is a combination of two antiretroviral drugs. It is also used for HIV treatment in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Taken daily, PrEP reduces a person's risk of contracting HIV by more than 99%. In the light of the permanent ban on gay men donating blood, in a questionnaire from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, for those who wish to donate blood, question No. 52 asks whether the individual has taken PrEP in the past five years. The HSE is engaged in a process to make PrEP available in Ireland, but there is no indication as to how long that will take. We know that people in Ireland are taking PrEP, accessed perhaps via the Six Counties or elsewhere in Europe. When Sinn Féin asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, for the reasoning behind question No. 52, he said in a reply I received this morning, "Question 52 was added to the IBTS Donor Health & Lifestyle Questionnaire on 16 January this year when the permanent deferral of men who have sex with men ... from donating blood was changed from a lifetime ban to a 12 month deferral from the most recent sexual contact with another man". Essentially, with any other man who has sex with a man, I will have to wait 12 months to donate blood. That is not in line with international best practice of a period of three months. I am informed by the Minister that the reason question No. 52 is in the questionnaire is, "Persons who have taken medication to prevent HIV infection, i.e. ... PrEP ... are [now] deferred for a 5 year period". This is a massive U-turn in terms of LGBT rights and the commitment in respect of gay men donating blood. While I will admit it is possible after a 12-month period, we are increasing the period fivefold for those who have taken PrEP. I want the Minister to come into the House to address the matter.

I support his endeavours in that regard because it would be a very useful adjunct in treating people with various ailments. I return to the issue of Brexit and the Leader of the Opposition's comments on traffic congestion in Dublin. She is quite right to say that, with the economy returning to strength in Dublin and the efforts to make that happen throughout the country, this is going to be an issue. Brexit will provide many challenges, of which we are aware, but it will also provide many opportunities in the Irish Financial Services Centre and other centres. We hear unofficially that many companies have already decided to come here without making much of a brouhaha about it because of other sensitivities. Hundreds of jobs are coming our way and thousands may do so into the future. The challenges that will present are in the areas of housing and the provision of office accommodation and, as has been mentioned, transport. Ireland has made a special case, which is accepted, and using the precedent of the reunification of West Germany and East Germany, we have an opportunity through the European Investment Bank to avail of moneys off book to allow us to expedite the provision of infrastructure that we need. In particular, I am talking about the metro which is now more important than ever. Dublin Airport's stunning performance in dealing with additional visitors to the country will be undermined if we cannot address the infrastructural deficit, not just with the metro which is critical and which will have the capacity to produce its own fare income to repay loans but also road projects, the absence of which havs restricted development. A major development at Belcamp was recently refused permission by Fingal County Council which had no other option because of the lack of road access. These issues need to be addressed urgently because there is no better place for the supply of housing. The land is available in Fingal. Some 75 acres have been rezoned for office development at Dublin Airport which has not yet been put to full use. The original Dublin Airport plan which provides for the creation of 10,000 jobs is already afoot. We have an opportunity to get up to 50,000 new jobs in the area. The infrastructure will serve the rest of the country, with park and ride facilities being provided in the area. They will be useful in getting into town, for international business people commuting and tourists to access the rest of the country. For all of the people mentioned, it is critical that there be a metro service like the service at Heathrow Airport where one can hop onto a train and travel into London. Why can the same not happen in Dublin? Again, I welcome the Government's initiative to avail of the capacity of the European Investment Bank to fund these projects off book. I do the metro project will receive the priority it should. It would help to relieve the traffic congestion mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition.

In six weeks' time this country and the world will celebrate the history and the story of a very famous undocumented migrant called St. Patrick. On that day and in that week it is imperative that we in this House and anybody with an Irish background tell the real story of Ireland. It is a story of emigration, an understanding of coffin ships, sectarian hatred, seeking refuge, violence and terrorism.It is extremely important, while the eyes of the world are on us, that we take a stand on that day and in that week and tell the real story of Ireland. In these very uncertain times, particularly following the executive orders produced by the Trump regime, the number of people with Irish-American names who surround the man is remarkable. I can think of names like Conway, Kelly, Bannon, Spicer and Pence. They want to give a certain view of the Irish-American experience. It is important that Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and Irish people across the world take a stand on St. Patrick's Day and in that week. We must remind the world that we know intimately what it is like to leave this country, what it meant to be on a coffin ship and takes to overcome sectarian hatred, deal with terrorism and division and seek peace. We must take stock of the experience in our own country.  I make reference to the recent goings on in Ballaghaderreen when local representatives were shown up completely by local people when asked to accept 80 Syrian refugees into their own community. I pay tribute to Mary Gallagher who I believe owns a small shop in Ballaghaderreen. When asked by RTE how she felt about the situation, she asked how, when one saw children being picked out of clay, could one say no. However, political representatives in that part of the world were slow in being as welcoming as she was. We in this House have a responsibility to work on a cross-party basis to ensure we will implement the recommendations made in the McMahon report on direct provision. We now have an opportunity to sort out our own house. We can say to the rest of the world that we are an emigrant nation, that we understand intimately the needs of emigrants across the world and that we will not allow the Irish story to be hijacked by the right-wing white national viewpoint of those who surround President Trump.

As Senators will know, the domiciliary care allowance is about €309 per month and paid to the carer of a child under 16 years of age with a severe disability. He or she must be living at home and require full-time care and attention, over and above the care and attention normally required by a child of that age. I am disturbed by the high number of appeals. In some cases applicants have been forced to pursue the matter through the courts to get justice. The Department has released figures for 2016 that show there were approximately 7,434 applications and that 1,344 appeals were lodged. The most startling figure was that of the 1,344 appeals lodged, as many as 1,065 were successful. That shows clearly that there is an issue with how applications are determined. Another issue worth considering is the time taken to process an application. It takes approximately 14 weeks for a decision to be made on an initial application. The hearing of an appeal takes up to 30 weeks. The figures clearly show that there is something wrong with how the Department considers applications and appeals. I urge the Leader to ask the Minister for Social Protection to consider the matter and put a mechanism in place to inform the carers of children in this category at an early stage about their entitlements.

Commissioner Phil Hogan has today announced the initiation of a public consultation process on the reform of the CAP. He has indicated that he wants to have a full and meaningful public consultation process and outlined his plans and vision for same. It is important that we note that he has invited farmers, professional bodies in the agriculture sector, as well as environmental organisations to give their views in the next three months. Details of the consultation process can be found on the Commission's website. The announcement is welcome because consultation needs to take place. This morning I read a brief piece on the matter. In his press release the Commissioner stated the aim of the review was to modernise and simplify the CAP. It will be a very big task to simplify it. We all know that there are major challenges to it in terms of food production, globalisation, the environment and how farmers and environmentalists work together. Other challenges include addressing the impact of Brexit, the effects the Russian import ban has had on agriculture, the slump in milk prices following the downturn and the lifting of quotas, market volatility and diversity. The key message to come from the Commissioner was that the consultation process presented an opportunity to discuss how the CAP could be simplified and still be meaningful and effective. This House needs to send a clear message on CAP reform. I ask all Members to spread the word about the three-month consultation process in their respective constituencies through the organisations, groups and bodies with which they are involved. I want them to ask and encourage people to engage in it in a meaningful way. Will the Leader indicate whether he has made progress on the establishment of a Seanad committee on Brexit? Clearly, Brexit will have an enormous negative impact on the agriculture sector on this island and in the United Kingdom.

It will afford him an opportunity to articulate all that is good in Ireland. He should tell the President that visitors and refugees are welcomed with compassion and courage on this island. He should also say Ireland is at peace, that we have torn down our walls and that we want to build bridges. Unfortunately, what is happening as a consequence of the Brexit vote and the election of President Trump is that the United States which was a democracy that had respect for human rights and the United Kingdom which is the home of parliamentary democracy are building walls, whereas once they built bridges. The Taoiseach should highlight the fact that in a democracy index Ireland has been ranked in the top six of over 160 countries. It measures the state of democracy against such factors as pluralism, civil liberties and political culture. Ireland has been ranked ahead of the United Kingdom which has been ranked 16th and the United States which has been ranked 21st. As a country, Ireland needs to be open, mature and confident enough to take its place among the nations. We can ask the United Kingdom and the United States to work with us. As Ireland is located between the two, we must be at the vanguard in promoting democratic rights.We must highlight to President Trump all that is good on the island of Ireland. I am not saying everything is good, but we should emphasise the positive. We have come a long way in the past 20 years.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	71	Many of the issues that are discussed in this House cannot be acted on unless we have a tax system that works efficiently. The arms of the State must support the collection of taxes, whether for hospitals, housing, supports for rural areas and so on. The tax base must be supported and sustained. In early January I contacted the Revenue Commissioners to highlight allegations that national lottery staff were giving tax avoidance advice to lottery winners on gift tax, inheritance tax and several other taxes. In the excitement of winning a large amount of money people will most likely take any advice they receive from the national lottery. In some cases, it is alleged, that the advice was to form a syndicate where none existed. I am deeply disturbed that the lottery licence may have been granted to agencies which see fit to help people to defraud the tax system. I have not yet had a response from Revenue to my query, but evidence recently put before the courts indicates that such activity did take place in the past. We do not know for how long it went on. The Minister must come to the House to assure us that the current licensee is not giving tax avoidance advice, which would constitute a breach of the tax code. There must be an assessment of the previous licensee to ascertain what advice it gave to customers and whether it colluded in the avoidance of tax. A former lottery claims manager told the High Court that he had advised sole winners that they possibly could form a syndicate, even where it had not been in existence prior to the win. That is a clear breach of law and, if the allegations are correct, tax was forgone. We are all agreed on the importance of bringing in foreign direct investment. For that and other reasons, the integrity of the tax system is important. A licensee of the State cannot be allowed to collude in the breaching of the tax code.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	72	We need to be very careful in discussing the issue raised by Senator Kevin Humphreys, given that there is an ongoing court case concerning a lottery claim. My understanding, having sold many lottery tickets over the years in my former role as a retailer, is that people are advised to sign the back of their ticket after purchase. When the national lottery pays out on a win, payment goes to the persons who signed the ticket. If a ticket is presented that has been signed by a number of people, it is deemed that they will share in the prize. A syndicate is really only a word for a number of people claiming the one prize. However, I take the Senator's point on board and it is important that we have clarification on the matter. Recent reports on the BBC and Channel 4 and other media on the practice of waterboarding engaged in by the British Government in Northern Ireland in the 1970s give cause for serious concern. We have had a great deal of reconciliation and progress as a result of the peace process in the past ten or 15 years, but the situation is still in its infancy and we have a long way to go in building reconciliation in the North. I encourage the Government to do even more to facilitate, engage with and develop the processes of reconciliation. The British Government, meanwhile, has a responsibility to order an inquiry into the very serious and credible allegations of waterboarding and other torture methods used in 1972 against a 17 year old. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach must raise the issue with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Brokenshire, and the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May. It is the only fair way to proceed. I tabled a motion in the House last week which was very well received, one aspect of which was the recognition that we could not move forward unless we understood and acknowledged the wrongs of the past and the good that happened. To move forward with a sense of confidence and ambition for Northern Ireland and the island as a whole, an ambition we all share, we must understand and acknowledge what happened in the past, on all sides, bad as some of it was. It is incumbent on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Taoiseach to raise this matter with people at the highest possible levels in the British Government.

Ireland has very few natural energy resources, meaning that we have to import most of what we need. Perhaps the Government has been made complacent by the commencement of production in the Corrib gas field at the end of 2015, but that supply will decline within five years. We must avoid putting all of our eggs in that basket. There was an interesting article by Joe Brennan in The Irish Times on Tuesday, in which he referred to a report by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies which expressed concern that Ireland might be effectively cut off from continental Europe's gas market when the United Kingdom left the European Union. The United Kingdom might try to gain leverage in the talks, a representative of the institute noted, by arguing it offered the cheapest way to provide security of supply for Irish customers. The report states Ireland will need to build a dedicated terminal to import liquefied natural gas and convert it back into gas. In that context, it is all the more amazing that we have had only an astounding silence from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on a particular project that is in line with the recommendations made in the report to which I have referred. The project is located in the Shannon Estuary in north Kerry, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach will know, and shovel ready, all planning stages having been completed. Furthermore, the State owns the property; it contains natural waterways and there is very little investment required in docking and marine site facilities. The delay in bringing the project to fruition has been ongoing for years. Four months ago a group representing all political parties in the county, business interests and community groups and headed up by the mayor of Kerry met the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, to discuss the status of the project, but we have heard nothing since. Members are probably bored of hearing me raise this issue by now. I again call on the Leader to ask the Minister to set up a task force or an interdepartmental group to work on the project which is vital for our long-term energy security. It is a clean, safe and environmentally friendly project that will safeguard our energy needs into the distant future and create a huge number of jobs in an area that has been badly let down in the past ten or 12 years.

We have a responsibility arising from that history to give leadership on the issue on a wider scale. Ireland was awarded the honour of chairing the high level UN summit on migration last September and played a key role in convening that summit. Will the Leader arrange a debate in which we can discuss what Ireland is doing in providing international leadership, not simply in terms of the number of migrants coming here but also within a wider context?A number of bilateral agreements were signed last autumn to effectively externalise many of the European Union's borders to ensure we would not see migrants on the streets of Europe. We know that deals are being made - in many cases with countries where the security of refugees is not guaranteed such as Sudan and Afghanistan - whereby refugees will not even be given the opportunity to put forward their case or reach us. We need to have clarity on the EU deals being signed in respect of the externalisation of the European Union's borders and Ireland's position in that regard. We also need to have clarity on how Ireland sees itself responding to the changes in the USA, including, for example, how we will respond to programme refugees from Somalia who were due to arrive in the United States. What is our position on the situation on the island of Nauru? Migrants on the island are in a shocking and appalling situation and it seems that they will also be let down in their arrangement with the United States. How does Ireland see itself stepping up in the international context and continuing the leadership it showed at the United Nations? I would appreciate a debate on the issue. On taxation, I share the concerns expressed about the tax base. I was very disappointed that both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil did not feel able to support my amendment last night to ensure we would have better communication between the Revenue Commissioners-----

I hope we will soon see development of the metro north rail link from Dublin Airport to the city centre. As Members know, the Government has committed an extra €2.6 billion to the capital investment programme, on top of the €27 billion in direct Exchequer funding and the €15 billion from other sources. It is important to welcome the extra allocation. Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor made reference to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, in the context of the national planning framework. The Minister is engaged in the development of a new framework and it is important that we give him credit as he always engages and actively seeks opinions. It is extraordinary to consider that only five years ago there was no gridlock in the capital city and no cranes on the skyline. It is to the credit of this and the last Government that we have turned the economy around. I am sure everyone welcomes the fact that there are more people at work and that more investment is taking place.

Senator Paul Gavan referred to the ruling of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom on the PSNI. I do not want to stray into the territory of that court, but we all want to see fair and just policing. That requires all sides to engage with the PSNI and be active in policing. It is important to welcome any decision that will make the streets and communities of Northern Ireland safer and, if I can use the term, more ecumenical.  On the situation in Palestine and President Trump, I share Senator Paul Gavan's views on the proposed relocation of the American embassy to Jerusalem. It is a very regressive move. I note that President Trump has appointed his son-in-law who will be actively involved in the particular area.

I am happy to accept Senator Grace O'Sullivan's proposed amendment to the Order of Business. I thank her for her proposal. Senator Denis Landy referred to the Irish Greyhound Board and its talks with the Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association. I agree with the Senator that there is a need for further dialogue and continuing efforts to reach a solution, if possible. I thank and pay tribute to Ms Geraldine Larkin, former CEO of the Irish Greyhound Board. I do not have a definitive answer to the Senator's question about the length of Dr. Sean Brady's tenure as interim CEO, but I believe it is for an unspecified period. I am sure the Irish Greyhound Board will put a plan in place to advertise the position and fill the vacancy quickly.  Senator Denis Landy also raised the issue of medicinal cannabis. It is my information that the Bill in question is the subject of scrutiny at the relevant committee, from where it will be advanced. I hope it will make its way back into the Houses quickly in order that it can be enacted. I agree with the Senator that as there are many people in Ireland who will benefit from the enactment of the legislation, its passage should be expedited.  Senators Joe O'Reilly, Jennifer Murnane O'Connor, James Reilly and Ned O'Sullivan all referred to Brexit. I assure the House that the Government is not complacent about it. It is under no illusions about the importance and magnitude of the decision made by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, not just in the context of North-South issues but also in economic terms across a variety of sectors. The Taoiseach has been actively engaged across Europe and the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, was in Ireland this week. The Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputies Charles Flanagan and Dara Murphy, as well as other Ministers, are traversing Europe and throughout the world to highlight the importance of Ireland being considered to be a special case in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations. The status of the North is an issue the Taoiseach has stressed at all times. Several Senators made reference to the remarks made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, but there is a recognition that the North requires special treatment. Those of us who are Members of this and the Lower House must work actively with the Government in that regard. Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor also spoke about the importance of rural Ireland. I remind her that the national spatial strategy introduced by her party was a failure. It fell victim to parish pump politics and many other things that were wrong in the country. I point out to her that we now have a national rural action plan which was launched recently, which contains 270 specified actions and is backed by an investment made by the Government of €60 million. I am sure she will join me in welcoming the action plan. I hope we will see more people employed in and a rejuvenation of rural Ireland.  Senator Catherine Noone spoke about the recent RTE programme on prescription drugs. Several good points were made yesterday during the debate on the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016. I will be happy to invite the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss the issue. Equally, the points made by the Senator about the deal with the telecommunications operators should be taken beyond this House and highlighted.  Senator Fintan Warfield referred to blood donations and the lifting of the lifetime ban on gay men donating blood, which I am sure he will agree was a welcome move. Many of us have worked actively to reach the point where there will now be a one-year deferral, rather than a lifetime ban. The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, has told me and said in reply to many parliamentary questions that he, his Department and officials are governed by scientific evidence and practice in other countries. That said, I will be very happy to sit down with the Senator, with a view to getting a working group together to work on the issue.

I agree with him in that regard.  Senators Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, Frank Feighan and Alice-Mary Higgins raised the very important issue of migration and referred to the fact that Ireland had benefited when its citizens went to America.It is important that it not be business as usual, as it would have been in the past, in availing of the opportunity presented around St. Patrick's Day and that the Taoiseach, Ministers and all of the travelling party who will visit many parts of the United States use the time to speak about our values in providing a welcome and refuge. It is about people who are being displaced for a variety of callous and evil reasons. It is important that we remember and recognise and inform President Trump that it was not too long ago when there were signs in many parts of England and America which read "Irish need not apply". We have a proud legacy, for which we can stand up and I am sure the Taoiseach will do so, as will Ministers. As Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin stated, we have a real story to tell. Those of us who have a different viewpoint from President Trump have an obligation to stand up and make our voices heard. On the points made by Senators Alice-Mary Higgins and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin about our immigration policy, it is important that we have an integrated strategy. I note that there was commentary on what was happening in Ballaghaderreen, but there was a positive outcome there, of which I am sure we all will see the benefits. Those who will arrive in Ballaghaderreen will be given a huge welcome and have positive experiences there. Senator Robbie Gallagher referred to the domiciliary care allowance. I will be happy to have the Minister for Social Protection come to the House to discuss the issue. To assist the Senator, he might table a Commencement matter on it. There may be an issue with processing. As Chairman of the previous health committee which travelled to the HSE medical card centre to discuss its processing mechanisms, it might be an issue the Senator could take up with the Minister at the committee. I join Senator Tim Lombard in welcoming the announcement of the tillage grain forum. It is important to give farmers who lost considerable income in the awful autumn weather an opportunity to plan for the future.  I thank Senator Victor Boyhan for raising the important topic of the Common Agricultural Policy. It is about the future of the European Union. The agriculture sector is very important to Ireland. The point made by the Senator is one of which we should not lose sight in the context of the impact of Brexit, relationships with Russia and globalisation. He correctly stated we should encourage those involved in the farming community to engage in what is an important consultation process. We might also have a discussion on how the House could play a role in that regard. The Cathaoirleach has made a ruling on the establishment of a Brexit committee. From speaking to the leaders at the group meeting this week, I am aware that it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider, but, as a House, we are anxious to stand united on it. The Cathaoirleach is equally adamant, but I hope we will have the matter progressed. I do not have any further information for the Senator, but I am aware that it is a matter the Cathaoirleach, as Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, will also pursue. Senator Kevin Humphreys referred to the tax collection system. As it is a matter that is before the courts, I will not delve into it, but I would be disappointed if the national lottery was issuing information to people on how to avoid tax payments. I do not believe the organisation is doing so. In a recent press statement, reported in a newspaper, the national lottery stated it did not do so and that it actively advised winners on the use of independent consultants. Let me add that I have not spoken to any lottery winner, but if it is the case, it is certainly something that should be looked into. Senator Martin Conway also referred to the national lottery.  Senator Martin Conway spoke about waterboarding in the context of reconciliation in the North. As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, we must learn from what happened in the past and engage in reconciliation. I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will take up the remarks made by the Senator. In response to Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, I will be happy to have a debate on the issue of migration. The Senator is correct on the issue of domestic violence. As a country, we have led the way in our legislation. The Tánaiste recently launched the new policy and I will be happy to have her come to the House to discuss the issue.

Mar Aire Stáit le freagracht as gnóthaí Gaeltachta, fáiltím roimh an deis seo labhairt leis an Seanad faoi chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise 20 bliain don Ghaeilge agus nithe gaolmhara. I dtús báire measaim gur gá a aithint gur le linn na géarchéime eacnamaíche is measa a bhuail an Stát riamh a lainseáladh an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010–2030. Go hiondúil, le haon straitéis infheistíochta Stáit mar seo, cuirtear i bhfeidhm í le meascán d'airgead atá ann cheana féin mar aon le hairgead nua a aimsítear ón Státchiste. Mar is eol do chách, ba a mhalairt a tharla i gcás na straitéise 20 bliain mar ní hamháin nár éirigh leis an Rialtas an t-airgead nua sin a aimsiú ach, go deimhin, ar mhaithe le heacnamaíocht na tíre a chur ar thalamh slán, b'éigean don Rialtas nua a tháinig isteach in 2011 ciorruithe a chur i bhfeidhm trasna an bhoird ar bheagnach gach líne bhuiséid a bhí ag an Státchiste. Ní nach ionadh mar sin go raibh leibhéal suntasach soiniciúlachta le feiceáil i measc an phobail don chéad chúpla bliain de shaolré na straitéise, rud a chuir an tionscadal uaillmhianach seo faoi mhíbhuntáiste ón tús. Tá mise, mar Aire Stáit le freagracht as gnóthaí Gaeltachta, dóchasach anois go bhfuil ré na gciorruithe curtha dínn agus fianaise de seo le feiceáil leis na buiséid sheasmhachta a aontaíodh do 2016 agus 2017. In ainneoin na gcúinsí deacra ina raibh gníomhaireachtaí na Gaeilge, idir mo Roinn féin, Foras na Gaeilge, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus na heagraíochtaí éagsúla atá á maoiniú acu, aithním go bhfuil éacht déanta acu leis an méid den straitéis 20 bliain atá bainte amach acu sa chéad sé bliana dá saolré. Mar is eol don choiste, is naoi réimse gnímh atá leagtha amach sa straitéis: an t-oideachas, an Ghaeltacht, an teaghlach agus luath-idirghabháil, riarachán, seirbhísí agus pobal, na meáin agus an teicneolaíocht, foclóirí, reachtaíocht agus stádas, an saol eacnamaíochta agus tionscnaimh leathana.  Ó thaobh na straitéise 20 bliain, foilsíodh í i mí na Nollag 2010 tar éis tacaíocht traspháirtí a fháil i dTithe an Oireachtais agus próiseas comhairliúcháin agus taighde. Is ar an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gnóthaí Réigiúnacha, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta atá an fhreagracht an straitéis a chomhordú agus a chur i bhfeidhm i gcomhar le réimse mór páirtithe leasmhara. Cuirtear é seo i gcrích tríd na struchtúir éagsúla, lena n-áirítear an Comhchoiste um Ealaíona, Oidhreacht, Gnóthaí Réigiúnacha, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, an coiste comhairleach do na heagrais Gaeilge, an grúpa idir-rannach agus na grúpaí ardleibhéil éagsúla. Ón uair gur foilsíodh an straitéis, tá dul chun cinn suntasach déanta ar chur i bhfeidhm na réimsí gnímh éagsúla atá luaite inti. Foilsíodh tuarascáil sa bhliain 2013 inar léiríodh an dul chun cinn foriomlán a rinneadh maidir le feidhmiú na straitéise le linn na tréimhse ó 2010 go 2013. Ina theannta sin, d'fhoilsigh na Ranna Rialtais ábhartha a gcuid pleananna forfheidhmithe faoin straitéis ag an am céanna. I mí Mheán Fómhair 2014, d’fhoilsigh na Ranna Rialtais ábhartha, 12 acu san iomlán agus mo Roinn féin san áireamh, tuarascálacha ar an dul chun cinn a bhí déanta acu ó 2013 faoin straitéis. Anuas air sin, i mí na Nollag 2015, d'fhoilsigh na Ranna Rialtais ábhartha tuarascálacha cúig-bliana ar chur i bhfeidhm na Straitéise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030 san tréimhse sin. Ós rud é go raibh an straitéis cúig-bliana ar an bhfód ag deireadh 2015, eagraíodh díospóireacht oscailte ina leith i mí na Nollag 2015 ar mhaithe le breathnú siar ar an méid a bhí déanta go dtí sin maidir lena cur i bhfeidhm chomh maith le breathnú chun cinn ar na tosaíochtaí ina leith don tréimhse cúig-bliana atá romhainn. Mar chuid den phróiseas, reáchtáladh sraith chruinnithe poiblí ag an tráth sin agus lorgaíodh aighneachtaí scríofa ón bpobal agus ó pháirtithe leasmhara araon. Ceapadh Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge in Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh ag an am ar mhaithe le tuairisc maidir leis an díospóireacht oscailte agus na príomhthosaíochtaí straitéiseacha don tréimhse amach romhainn a chur i dtoll a chéile. Mar is eol don choiste, d'fhógair mé le déanaí go raibh socraithe agam an tuarascáil sin a chur faoi bhráid an choiste comhairligh a bunaíodh chun tacú le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise, le breithniú a dhéanamh uirthi. Is mé féin, mar Aire Stáit le freagracht as gnóthaí Gaeltachta, atá mar chathaoirleach ar an gcoiste comhairleach. Tá sé socraithe anois go mbeidh an chéad chruinniú eile den choiste comhairleach, atá ionadaíoch ar na heagraíochtaí éagsúla Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, ar siúl ar an 15 Feabhra 2016. Agus tuairimí agus moltaí an choiste a bheith faighte ina leith, tá sé i gceist go mbeidh plean gníomhaíochta don tréimhse 2017 go 2022 á chur i dtoll a chéile ag an Roinn agus á fhoilsiú.  Ó thaobh chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise, tá allúntas breise de €250,000 ar fáil i mbliana chun cabhrú tuilleadh le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise agus an chórais pleanála teanga araon. Fágann sé seo go mbeidh cistíocht ar fiú €1.25 milliúin in iomlán ar fáil i mbliana lena haghaidh. Ina theannta sin, ar ndóigh, tá ardú ar an gcistíocht atá ar fáil do na gnáthchláir reatha ar thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, a bhfuil dlúthbhaint acu chomh maith le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise 20 bliain. Leis an allúntas méadaithe atá curtha ar fáil don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht trí chéile, tá mé cinnte go mbeifear in ann tacú tuilleadh le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise agus an phróisis pleanála teanga mar a bhaineann sé leis an nGaeltacht, na bailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta agus na líonraí Gaeilge. Mar is iondúil ag an tráth seo den bhliain, tá an phleanáil chuí idir lámha ag mo Roinn i gcomhar le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, le Foras na Gaeilge agus go deimhin le páirtithe leasmhara eile chun cúram cuí a dhéanamh den chistíocht shuntasach seo sa chaoi is go mbainfear an leas is fearr as ar son na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta. Ní call dom a rá go n-aithníonn mo Roinn an ról lárnach atá ag an teaghlach mar a bhaineann sé le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge go bisiúil chuig an chéad ghlúin eile. Sa chomthéacs sin ba mhaith liom an deis a thapú chun cúpla focal a rá faoin gclár tacaíochta teaghlaigh. Is í aidhm an chláir seo, a ceapadh mar bheart faoi leith le cúram a dhéanamh de réimsí na Gaeltachta agus an teaghlaigh de chuid na straitéise, tacú ar bhealach ilghnéitheach le treisiú na Gaeilge i dteaghlaigh Ghaeltachta. Faoin gclár, cuirtear cúnamh ar fáil trí scéimeanna agus tionscnaimh faoi leith de chuid mo Roinne ar leasa theaghlaigh na Gaeltachta atá ag tógáil clainne le Gaeilge nó a dteastaíonn uathu é sin a dhéanamh.  Ó thaobh Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, mar is eol don choiste, tugann an tAcht feidhm reachtúil don phróiseas pleanála teanga faoina mbeidh pleananna teanga á n-ullmhú ag leibhéal an phobail i gceantair a bhféadfaí aitheantas a thabhairt dóibh faoin Acht mar limistéir phleanála teanga Ghaeltachta, mar bhailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta nó mar líonraí Gaeilge. Tabharfar tréimhse ama don phobal chun pleananna teanga a ullmhú agus a fheidhmiú. Faoin reachtaíocht, is faoin Roinn a bheidh sé measúnú a dhéanamh ar phleananna teanga sula ndéanfar iad a fhaomhadh. Tá an Roinn freagrach freisin as athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar bhonn tréimhsiúil ar chur i bhfeidhm na bpleananna teanga. Ag an bpointe seo tá an próiseas chun pleananna teanga a ullmhú ag leibhéal an phobail tosaithe i 23 den 26 limistéar pleanála teanga Ghaeltachta atá leagtha amach faoin bpróiseas. Tá sé aontaithe ag mo Roinn le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta go mbeidh an próiseas tosaithe i ngach aon cheann de na limistéir go gairid. Maidir leis an gcéad phunann de limistéir a thosaigh ag ullmhú a gcuid pleananna ag tús an phróisis in 2014, beidh a gcuid pleananna teanga faoi seach á gcur acu faoi bhráid mo Roinne le ceadú thar an achar ama atá romhainn.Leis an gcistíocht bhreise atá curtha ar fáil, mar a thagair mé dó ar ball, tá súil agam a bheith in ann féachaint chuige go gcuirtear tús le feidhmiú na bpleananna teanga ar bhonn áitiúil i mbliana i gcomhréir le mianta chomhphobail na Gaeltachta. Is dul chun cinn suntasach é seo agus ba mhaith liom an deis seo a thapú inniu chun tréaslú leis na ceanneagraíochtaí ar fud fad na Gaeltachta atá i mbun ullmhú pleananna teanga. Tá obair mhór déanta agus idir lámha ag na heagraíochtaí sin ar son na Gaeilge, ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son an phobail ina bhfuil siad ag maireachtáil. Is é an spiorad sin, spiorad na meithile, atá ag croílár an phróisis agus is cóir agus is ceart é sin a aithint. Ina theannta sin, tá obair idir lámha chun an próiseas a bhrú ar aghaidh mar a bhaineann sé leis na bailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta. Chuige sin, tá an t-údarás agus Foras na Gaeilge i mbun oibre le páirtithe leasmhara i Leitir Ceanainn, cathair na Gaillimhe agus Daingean Uí Chúis chun an próiseas pleanála teanga sna bailte sin a bhrú chun cinn. Chomh maith leis sin, tá tús curtha leis an bpróiseas pleanála teanga i gCluain Dolcáin, in Inis agus i mBaile Locha Riach i dtreo a bheith in ann aitheantas mar líonraí Gaeilge a bhronnadh ar na ceantair sin. Tá sé beartaithe an ghné seo den phróiseas a fhorbairt tuilleadh sa bhliain atá romhainn agus tús a chur le hullmhú pleananna teanga i mbailte eile, nach iad atá ar an liosta de bhailte a foilsíodh in 2014, a d’fhéadfadh a bheith aitheanta chomh maith faoin bpróiseas mar bhailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta. Ní call dom a rá ar ndóigh go leanfaidh mé orm, mar Aire Stáit do ghnóthaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, le gach iarracht gur féidir agus gur gá a dhéanamh chun an oiread cistíochta agus is féidir a fháil chun tacú leis an bpróiseas tábhachtach seo atá agus a bheidh ag croílár chlár oibre mo Roinne mar a bhaineann sé leis an nGaeltacht sna blianta atá romhainn. Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá anois faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta. Mar is eol do Sheanadóirí, is é Údarás na Gaeltachta an ghníomhaireacht fhorbartha réigiúnach don Ghaeltacht. Tá gníomhaíochtaí Údarás na Gaeltachta dírithe ar shaol teangeolaíoch, sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta. Tá sé tiomanta do phobal agus eacnamaíocht Gaeltachta inmharthana a fhorbairt chun an Ghaeilge a spreagadh mar phríomh-theanga pobail an réigiúin. Faoi Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, tá cúramaí faoi leith sainithe don údarás maidir leis an gcuid sin den phróiseas pleanála teanga a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht agus le bailte Gaeltachta faoi leith a d’fhéadfadh a bheith ainmnithe in am trátha mar bhailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta. Faoin Acht, leagtar an fhreagracht ar an údarás tacú le pobail na Gaeltachta agus na mbailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta de réir mar is cuí chun pleananna teanga a ullmhú agus a fheidhmiú. I dtaca le ról fiontraíochta an údaráis, chuir mé fáilte le déanaí roimh dhea-fhigiúirí fostaíochta an údaráis do 2016. Tógáil croí é a fheiceáil go bhfuil leibhéal fostaíochta seasmhach sna Gaeltachtaí agus go bhfuil borradh faoi ghnóthaí nua fós ann le 36 comhlacht nua ag dul i mbun gnó in 2016 agus 100 post cruthaithe iontu roimh dheireadh na bliana. Ar ndóigh, tá áthas orm gur éirigh liom maoiniú breise de €2.4 milliún a chur ar fáil do bhuiséad caipitil Údarás na Gaeltachta le linn 2016. Táim sásta gur chuir an maoiniú breise seo ar chumas Údarás na Gaeltachta poist a choinneáil ina gcliant-chomhlachtaí sa Ghaeltacht agus tuilleadh infheistíochta a mhealladh go ceantair Ghaeltachta. Chuige sin, is í mo thuiscint go bhfuil sí mar aidhm ag an údarás 500 post nua a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht in 2017. Ní miste dom a lua chomh maith go mbeidh ról lárnach ag Údarás na Gaeltachta i bhfeidhmiú an phlean gnímh do cheantair tuaithe na hÉireann. Tuigfidh Seanadóirí gur ar an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna a thiteann an fhreagracht an polasaí don oideachas Gaeltachta 2017-2022 a chur i bhfeidhm. D'fhéadfaí a rá gur aisfhreagra suntasach is ea an polasaí seo ar a bhfuil ráite agus molta sa straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge mar a bhaineann sé le cúrsaí oideachais sa Ghaeltacht. Mar léiriú breise ar dáiríreacht leanúnach an Rialtais seo chun cúram a dhéanamh do chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise, is díol suntais é go bhfuil aonad polasaí oideachais Gaeltachta faoi leith bunaithe cheana féin ag mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire, an Teachta Bruton, chun cur i bhfeidhm an polasaí a bhrú chun cinn. Léiríonn sé seo uile go bhfuil céim thábhachtach eile chun cinn glactha ag an Rialtas ar son na Gaeilge agus cur i bhfeidhm córasach na straitéise. Ag eascairt as athbhreithniú a rinneadh ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003, tá Bille ullmhaithe chun forálacha áirithe den Acht a leasú. I gcomhthéacs na n-éileamh éagsúil atá déanta maidir leis an Acht a láidriú tuilleadh, tá sé socraithe agam an Bille leasaithe a scrúdú go cúramach sula dtéim chuig an Rialtas chun cead a fháil é a fhoilsiú. Go deimhin, go luath tar éis mo cheapacháin mar Aire Stáit, thapaigh mé an deis labhairt leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga maidir leis na féidearthachtaí éagsúla a chuideodh le bonn níos láidre a chur faoi sholáthar seirbhísí Stáit i nGaeilge do shaoránaigh an Stáit. Beidh mé ag scrúdú na bhféidearthachtaí seo sna míonna amach romhainn d’fhonn moltaí sonracha a thabhairt chuig an gcoiste Rialtais ar na healaíona, an Ghaeilge, an Ghaeltacht agus na hoileáin, atá bunaithe faoi chathaoirleacht an Taoisigh. Tá síneadh cúig-bliana eile go 31 Nollaig 2021 curtha leis an maolú atá i bhfeidhm maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge in institiúidí an Aontais Eorpaigh. Chomhaontaigh Comhairle an Aontais Eorpaigh ar an 3 Nollaig 2015 rialacháin a dhéanamh lena leagtar amach méadú incriminteach ar na catagóirí de reachtaíocht an AE atá le haistriú go Gaeilge agus leanúint lena gcur chuige réamhghníomhach i dtaobh eolais a chuirtear ar fáil i nGaeilge faoi ghníomhaíochtaí an AE a mhéadú. Tá roinnt céimeanna tógtha anseo in Éirinn agus sa Bhruiséil chun tabhairt faoi dheireadh a chur leis an maolú in 2021. Tá ionad náisiúnta barr feabhais bunaithe ag mo Roinn chun oiliúint chuí a chur ar chéimithe le Gaeilge agus chun feidhmiú mar phointe teagmhála d’Institiúidí an Aontais Eorpaigh más mian leo daoine a fhostú ar chonartha sealadacha. Tá obair ar siúl ag an gCoimisiún Eorpach agus ag institiúidí an aontais chun a chinntiú go n-earcófar líon dhóthanach pearsanra le Gaeilge chun deireadh céimniúil an mhaolaithe a bhainistiú. Tá grúpa monatóireachta bunaithe ag an gCoimisiún agus ag Rialtas na hÉireann chun monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar chur i bhfeidhm phlean gníomhaíochta atá forbartha agus ar an dul chun cinn maidir leis an méadú incriminteach ar sheirbhísí Ghaeilge atá leagtha síos sna rialacháin. Feidhmíonn an grúpa monatóireachta ar dhá leibhéal, leibhéal stiúrtha agus leibhéal oibríochtúil, agus bíonn oifigigh na Roinne ag tuairisciú don ghrúpa maidir leis an obair atá ar bun. Leis na forbairtí seo uile, táim lán-mhuiníneach go mbeidh ar ár gcumas deireadh a chur leis an maolú in 2021. Thóg an Rialtas cinneadh ar an 30 Deireadh Fómhair 2013 deireadh a chur le marcanna bónais a bhronnadh ar oilteacht Ghaeilge in earcaíocht agus comórtais ardaithe céime na Státseirbhíse agus córas nua bunaithe ar inniúlacht a chur ina áit. Is í an aidhm atá ag an gcóras nua ná líon na ndátheangach feidhmiúla sa Státseirbhís a mhéadú. Ina theannta sin, sonraítear i bpleananna fórsa oibre Ranna agus oifigí Rialtais na poist nó réimsí oibre ina bhfuil gá le baill foirne atá in ann feidhmiú sa dá theanga oifigiúil. Ag féachaint do chur i bhfeidhm Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, iarrtar ar Ranna aird ar leith a thabhairt ar phoist atá lonnaithe i gceantair Ghaeltachta nó atá ag freastal ar na ceantair sin. Ag teacht leis an gcur chuige seo, tá foráil sa teimpléad nua a úsáidtear chun scéimeanna teanga a aontú a thugann deis do chomhlachtaí poiblí na poist ina dteastaíonn cumas Gaeilge a shainiú. Mar gur faoi gach Roinn féin atá sé a gcuid riachtanas Gaeilge a aithint agus aghaidh a thabhairt orthu, tá iarrtha agam ar mo chuid oifigeach plé a thosú lena gcomhghleacaithe cuí sna Ranna Stáit eile agus sna príomh-chomhlachtaí poiblí, an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe san áireamh, chun an gá atá acu le dátheangaigh fheidhmiúla a scrúdú. Tá comhaontú seirbhíse sínithe ag mo Roinn leis an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe chun oiliúint sa Ghaeilge agus tástáil inniúlachta a sholáthar don Státseirbhís. Is í aidhm an chomhaontaithe seo tacú leis an bhfoireann chun a n-inniúlacht sa Ghaeilge a fhorbairt agus chun cur le cumas na Státseirbhíse seirbhísí a chur ar fáil don phobal i nGaeilge. Tá an comhaontú seo tábhachtach, ach go háirithe i gcomhthéacs Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúia 2003 agus an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge. Faoin gcomhaontú, tá freagrachtaí ar mo Roinn i dtaca le hoiliúint agus measúnú inniúlachta sa Ghaeilge a éascú don fhoireann sa Státseirbhís. Tá réimse leathan de chúrsaí oiliúna sa Ghaeilge á sholáthar ag an gcomhlacht Gaelchultúr chun na críche seo faoi chonradh atá aontaithe le Foras na Gaeilge. Tá curtha in iúl ag Gaelchultúr go bhfuil thart ar 1,200 duine sa bhreis agus 80 eagraíocht Stáit tar éis cúrsaí Gaeilge a dhéanamh ó cuireadh tús leis an scéim áirithe sin in 2011. Lena chois sin, tá níos mó ná 400 fostaí ó bhreis is 20 comhlacht de chuid na hearnála poiblí tar éis tabhairt faoin teastas sa Ghaeilge ghairmiúil a chuireann Gaelchultúr ar fáil. Bunaíodh an ciste tríú leibhéal thar lear in 2006 chun teagasc na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn in institiúdí tríú leibhéal í dtíortha eile. Is iad aidhmeanna an chiste dea-thoil i leith na Gaeilge agus an chultúir Ghaelaigh i gcoitinne a spreagadh agus a chothú trasna na hEorpa, sna Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá, i gCeanada agus níos faide i gcéin. Tríd an tionscnamh seo, cruthaítear ardán don Ghaeilge trínar féidir eolas a chur uirthi ar bhonn idirnáisiúnta. Cuireann sé go mór le scoláireacht na Gaeilge i measc an phobail acadúil idirnáisiúnta agus méadaítear stádas na teanga dá réir. Tá ag éirí go han-mhaith leis an tionscnamh seo agus tá méadú leanúnach tagtha ar na hiarratais faoin scéim ó bhliain go bliain. Mar léiriú air sin, tá deontais de €1.8 milliún san iomlán ceadaithe don tréimhse 2016-17 go 2018-19 le os cionn 40 ollscoil agus coláistí tríú leibhéal timpeall an domhain. Tugann an cúnamh seo deis chomh maith d’ollscoileanna Eorpacha, don Choimisiún Fulbright agus don Fhondúireacht Ollscoile Éireann Cheanada scoláireachtaí a bhronnadh ar mhic léinn chun cuairt a thabhairt ar Éirinn agus freastal ar chúrsaí Gaeilge sna ceantair Ghaeltachta i rith an tsamhraidh. Creidim go láidir go bhfuil féidearthachtaí móra ann cuidiú le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge tríd an teicneolaíocht. Is cúis sásaimh agus dóchais é an chaoi go bhfuil an Ghaeilge le fáil go forleathan cheana ar na meáin dhigiteacha. Tóg mar shampla na hardáin éagsúla ilmheáin atá forbartha ag RTE, TG4 agus RTE Raidió na Gaeltachta. Tá tábhacht ar leith le nuachtáin agus irisí Gaeilge ar nós Tuairisc.ie, Nós.ie agus an iris liteartha, Comhar. Tá forbairtí móra déanta agus á ndéanamh ar chorpas na Gaeilge leis an bhfoclóir nua Foclóir.ie agus an suíomh Téarma.ie. Chomh maith leis sin, tá tacaíocht á thabhairt ag mo Roinn d’Acadamh Ríoga na hÉireann chun foclóir stairiúil na Gaeilge a chur i gcrích. Anuas ar na forbairtí seo go léir, tá córais ríomh-aistriúcháin don Ghaeilge forbartha ag DCU agus TCD agus tá an tionscadal taighde Abair.ie i gColáiste na Trionóide ag déanamh tuilleadh forbartha ar shintéiseoir Gaeilge, sé sin, córas inar féidir téacs scríofa a aistriú go caint bheo i gcanúintí éagsúla. Chun na deiseanna teicneolaíochta seo ar fad a threisiú san am amach romhainn, tá plean digiteach don Ghaeilge á ullmhú faoi láthair le tacaíocht mo Roinne agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé réidh le seoladh gan mhoill. Mar atá ráite go minic roimhe seo, ní miste dom a threisiú arís gur dóigh liom go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar cheann de na hacmhainní nádúrtha is luachmhaire atá againn. Creideann an Rialtas go bhfuil tábhacht ag baint le pobal labhartha láidir Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta a chothú chun saibhreas oidhreachta na teanga a choinneáil beo agus a thabhairt slán don chéad ghlúin eile. Cé go bhfuil an Rialtas tiomanta gach a dhéanamh laistigh dá chumhacht chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, tá todhchaí na teanga ag brath go príomha ar an bpobal. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil dearcadh dearfach ag tromlach an phobail i leith na teanga. Tá orainn timpeallacht a chothú ina mbraitheann daoine muiníneach as a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid, is cuma cén leibhéal cumais atá acu inti. Tá sé riachtanach go leanfar ag baint leas as an teanga mar theanga phobail agus teaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht agus go gcuirfear an teanga chun cinn ar bhonn níos forleithne taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Is gnéithe fíor-thábhachtacha dár n-oidhreacht chultúrtha iad an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht agus is onóir agus pribhléid domsa an deis a fháil mo chion féin a dhéanamh mar Aire Stáit as seo chun tacú le caomhnú agus forbairt na hoidhreachta sin. Aithním agus tuigim go maith gur ag obair i gcomhar lena chéile is fearr a bhainfidh muid torthaí fónta amach chun an oidhreacht bheo seo a thabhairt ar aghaidh slán don chéad ghlúin eile. Ar deireadh, ba mhaith liomsa tiomantas agus dáiríreacht an Rialtais i leith chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise 20 bliain don Ghaeilge a threisiú uair amháin eile anseo inniu. Aithnítear sa straitéis féin go bhfuil gá le cur chuige céimneach chun bearta éagsúla na straitéise a chur i gcrích. Táim sásta go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh maidir le raon leathan gníomhaíochtaí faoin straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm de réir a chéile ar bhealach córasach laistigh de na hacmhainní atá ar fáil. Táim sásta freisin go bhfuil cur chuige soiléir ann maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise agus go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh go staidéarach agus go stuama laistigh de na hacmhainní atá ar fáil.

#CatherineArdagh	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-party	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-dob	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	135	Tá mé an-bhuíoch go bhfuil an tAire Stáit tagtha isteach sa Seanad inniu chun an deis a thabhairt dúinn cúrsaí Gaolainne agus an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge a phlé. Tá sé ar cheann de chuspóirí Fhianna Fáil ó thráth a bhunaíodh an páirtí an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar theanga bheo i measc na ndaoine agus cearta na ndaoine a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge a chosaint. Tá an teanga náisiúnta ar sheoda cultúir na tíre seo agus ní féidir cur síos ar an tábhacht chinniúnach atá léi dá réir. Seasann Fianna Fáil go deimhin leis an stratéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge, faoi mar a thug an páirtí chun cinn agus é sa Rialtas, agus lena cur i bhfeidhm. Thug an páirtí Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 isteach chomh maith faoina ndearnadh bonn reachtaíochta a chur den chéad uair faoi na cearta maidir leis an teanga atá ina ndlúthchuid den Bhunreacht. Is trua, mar sin, nach raibh dúthracht maidir leis an teanga ná le cearta teanga a chosaint ag an Rialtas roimhe seo faoi cheannas Fhine Gael. Ní mór ceannródaíocht leanúnach agus cistíocht chun go mbeadh rath ar an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge a thabhairt i bhfeidhm. B’ábhar mór díomá dúinne a fheiceáil go bhfuil an chistíocht maidir leis an nGaeilge don bhliain 2017 íslithe 9% i gcomórtas leis an mbliain 2016. Chuir an ciorrú sin uafás orainn agus chuir Fianna Fáil feachtas ar bun ag iarraidh ciste breise. D’éirigh linn €1 mhilliún breise a aimsiú don Ghaeilge i rith na bliana 2017 sna Meastacháin Fhorlíontacha. Cruthaíodh go críochnúil an neamhaird atá ag Fine Gael ar pholasaí maidir leis an nGaeilge nuair nach raibh ar chumas an Aire is sinsearaí atá ceaptha sa Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gnóthaí Réigiúnacha, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta a cuid ghnó oifigiúla a dhéanamh i nGaeilge. I ndáil leis an sprioc maidir le líon na gcainteoirí a labhraíonn Gaeilge gach lá a ardú ó 83,000 go dtí 250,000, dúirt an tlar-Choimisinéir Teanga sa bhliain 2013 gur deacair duine ar bith a aimsiú a chreideann gur féidir an sprioc sin a thabhairt i gcrích. Céim síos eile don teanga a bhí i gcinneadh an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe deireadh a chur leis an 6% breise don Ghaeilge i scrúduithe iontrála na Státseirbhíse. Anuas air sin, leagadh amach mar ghealltanas i gclár an Rialtais sa bhliain 2011 smaoineamh ar dheireadh a chur leis an nGaeilge éigeantach san ardteistiméireacht, léiriú eile ar mheon Fhine Gael. Is é sprioc Fhianna Fáil, mar a leagadh amach sa chlár d'olltoghchán na bliana seo caite, Aire sinsearach leis an nGaeilge agus an nGaeltacht mar príomh-chúram uirthi nó air, coiste Oireachtais a chur i mbun ar a mbeidh freagracht maidir le gnóthaí na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge, tabhairt faoi na deacrachtaí cistíochta atá ag Foras na Gaeilge agus Údarás na Gaeltachta trí acmhainní breise a chur ar fáil dóibh agus cinntiú go mbeidh an Ghaeilge i gcónaí ag croí an churaclaim don teastas sóisearach agus don ardteistiméireacht. It was part of the Fianna Fáil general election manifesto, for which Fianna Fáil campaigned, that it would appoint a senior Minister with primary responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, establish a full Oireachtas committee with responsibility for Gaeltacht and language affairs, address the funding difficulties of Foras na Gaeilge and Údarás na Gaeltachta through the provision of additional resources and, ultimately, ensure the Irish language would remain at the heart of the junior and leaving certificate curriculums. Fianna Fáil’s policy is to continue to fulfil these election promises. It will campaign on the points made within the manifesto.
#MauraHopkins	unknown-#MauraHopkins-party	unknown-#MauraHopkins-dob	unknown-#MauraHopkins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	136	Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Kyne, atá anseo linn inniu.Tá sé an-dearfach go bhfuil sé anseo chun éisteacht le ráitis ar an nGaeilge agus tá mé ag súil go mór le díospóireacht ina leith. Ó bhunú an Stáit seo, tá tacaíocht d'úsáid na Gaeilge ina phríomhthosaíocht. However, our national language is very much at a crossroads, with an unfortunate consistent decline in usage in recent years. The 2011 census of population for the Republic found that about 77,000 people had reported using Irish as a daily language outside the education system. Some 1.2 million people had reported using it at least occasionally in or out of school. A total of 41% had reported being able to speak Irish. We continue to await the results of the 2016 census of population to examine the trend further. I commend the Minister of State and the Department for their commitment to the national language. It is really positive to see that funding has been increased in key areas in recent years to support the language. In budget 2017, €7.8 million was provided for the Department towards the promotion and maintenance of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, while a further €3.8 million has been provided for the promotion of the language outside the Gaeltacht. Irish is the first official language of the nation, but it is much more than just a language. It is very much the hallmark of our national identity. Tugadh aitheantas do thábhacht na Gaeilge mar theanga náisiúnta nuair a tugadh san áireamh go hoifigiúil é mar theanga oifigiúil de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh le blianta beaga anuas. The 20-year national strategy for the Irish language was launched in 2010. The strategy provides us with an essential plan to make the use of Irish more visible in society, both as a spoken language and also within areas such as signage, literature and arts. Tá sé riachtanach anois go dtugann an plean seo fíorbhuntáistí do dhaoine. An bhliain seo caite, thug an comóradh 100 bliain fócas athnua ar ár n-oidhreacht. Ní mór dúinn úsáid a bhaint as an bhfócas seo chun an teanga a chur chun cinn. We must set the bar high. We need to set it throughout the country to increase the number of families who use Irish as their daily means of communication. I very much believe the key to achieving this goal is our focus towards using Irish as a language in education. There is a strong need for a change in how we teach Irish in schools. It is very unfortunate that almost every person in the country has spent 13 years learning Irish in school, yet only 41% of us have the ability to speak Irish. The focus must be on primary schools. The early years are key to our learning of languages. Without a solid basis, it will continue to be difficult to gain a greater knowledge. Many young people also have quite a negative perception of Irish as a subject in school. We need to encourage young people to use the language outside the classroom. A new curriculum was introduced into primary schools in September 2014. It has been positive in making the teaching and learning of the language more accessible. However, there is scope to do more and change how we approach Irish as a subject. Tá scóip anseo an teanga a úsáid in ábhair eile cosúil le ealaín agus corpoideachais chun an teanga a mhíniú mar chuspóir praiticiúil agus léiriú dár ndaoine óga conas is féidir an teanga a úsáid ina saolta ó lá go lá. Tá na fadhbanna den chineál céanna ag an dara leibhéal. Ní mór a rá go raibh méadú ar na marcanna a bhronnadh mar chuid den scrúdú béil don ardteistiméireacht mar chéim an-dearfach. Arís, tá na ceisteanna céanna ann, nach bhfuil ár ndaoine óga in ann ról don Ghaeilge mar theanga a fheiceáil ina saolta laethúla. Faoi láthair, tá teip ar ár gcóras oideachais chun muinín a thabhairt do dhaoine i labhairt na Gaeilge. Since its foundation, the work of Foras na Gaeilge to promote the Irish language in every aspect of life throughout the country has been very successful, for which the organisation must be commended. I was delighted to see the Minister of State secure increased funding for Foras na Gaeilge in budget 2017. Foras na Gaeilge supports the Irish language through a series of community projects and initiatives in the areas of art, education, business and media. It is this focus that will be the key to ensuring there is a long-term future for Irish as a language through its use in such everyday settings. The work will be underpinned by the action plan for rural Ireland which has specifically recognised the importance of the Irish language. It has set targets, including for investment in the language, the provision of infrastructure in Gaeltacht areas, implementation of Foras na Gaeilge’s development plan for cultural tourism in the Gaeltacht and schemes that support the Irish language community such as summer camps and special youth events. These underpin the key goals set out previously in giving practical application to Irish in people's everyday lives. Mar fhocal scoir, is léir go bhfuil dúshlán casta amach roimh ár dteanga náisiúnta, ach tá deiseanna ann. Is céim dhearfach í an méadú le déanaí i maoiniú chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. In 1893, bhí fear ó mo chontae fhéin, Ros Comáin, Dubhghlas de hÍde, lárnach i mbunú Conradh na Gaeilge chun cultúr, ceol, rince agus teanga na tíre a chaomhnú. Tá na haidhmeanna chomh tábhachtach inniu is a bhí siad in 1893 agus is mór dúinn iarracht a dhéanamh ár dteanga náisiúnta a chosaint agus a fheabhsú. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit as ucht a bheith linn inniu.

Is dóigh nárbh leor a admháil ar dtús go bhfuil sé ag déanamh sár-iarracht ó thaobh a chuid oibre mar Aire Stáit don Ghaeltacht. Ach, fágadh praiseach dó le glanadh suas. Tá sé spéisiúil a bheith ag éisteacht le Fianna Fáil ag caitheamh spallaí leis an Aire Stáit nuair is é Fianna Fáil a ghearr na putóga amach as na buiséid a bhain le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta ó 2008 ar aghaidh agus a d’fhág Údarás na Gaeltachta ar an ngannchuid. Is ar éigean go bhfuil an maoiniú breise atá tugtha don Aire Stáit do chúrsaí Gaeilge le boilsciú. Ní leor ar chor ar bith an méid airgid atá á chur ar fáil. Tá sé ar an rannóg is lú sa Roinn is lú sa Rialtas. Níl sé sách maith ar chor ar bith. Tuigim go bhfuil an tAire Stáit ag troid le haghaidh breis airgid. Molaim é as sin a dhéanamh. Caithfidh an Taoiseach agus an tAire Airgeadais - beirt le Gaeilge - dúiseacht suas. Má tá siad i ndáiríre faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge, caithfidh siad a lámha a chur ina bpócaí agus breis airgid a thabhairt leis na spriocanna atá ag an Rialtas a chur i bhfeidhm. Ó bheith ag éisteacht le hóráid an Aire Stáit agus gach rud a bhí molta ann, tá rudaí maithe déanta ag an Rialtas, ar nós an pholasaí oideachais Gaeltachta, an straitéis, Acht na dTeangacha is araile. Nuair a léann duine tuarascálacha faoi aon cheann de na gníomhaíochtaí seo, deirtear go bhfuil sé ag brath ar acmhainní. An rud atá gach duine ar an talamh ag rá liomsa ná nach bhfuil na hacmhainní cuí á gcur ar fáil. Mar shampla, deineadh ciorrú 13% ar chiste caipitil Roinn na Gaeltachta sa mbuiséad deireanach. Níl aon trácht á dhéanamh air sin i láthair na huaire. An rud is tábhachtaí faoin straitéis ná go bhfuil sé ag tógáil píosa fada le cur i bhfeidhm agus níl na hacmhainní cuí ar fáil. Tá dreamanna ann, cosúil leis an gcoiste pleanála teanga i gCois Fharraige, mar shampla, a bhfuil plean ullmhaithe acu agus sár-obair déanta ag an bpobal. Tá an straitéis ag cur an brú ar fad ar na pobail teacht suas le na pleananna agus na straitéisí. Ar bhealach, tá daoine ann a cheapfadh go bhfuil caora á chur thar abhainn maidir le hacmhainní a chur ar fáil le haghaidh imeachtaí óige, imeachtaí aosacha, gníomhaíochtaí pobail agus mar sin de a chur ar bun agus go mbeidh na pleananna réitithe. Tá siadsan anois ag lorg airgid mhór leis an bplean a chur i gcrích. An cheist atá agam ar an Aire Stáit ná an mbeidh na hacmhainní sin ar fáil leis an bplean a chur i gcrích. Níl aon mhaitheas i 26 limistéar pleanála teanga muna bhfuil an Rialtas chun teacht suas leis an maoiniú chun na pleananna teanga sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Maidir le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, ní thuigim cén moilleadóireacht atá ar bun. Is léir go raibh an próiseas maidir le hathbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an Acht uafásach ar fad. Is léir go raibh sé i gceist ag an dream a chuaigh roimh an Aire lagú a dhéanamh ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Molaim an tAire Stáit as a bheith ag rá anseo go soiléir inniu go bhfuil i gceist aige treisiú agus láidriú a dhéanamh ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Tá géarghá le sin. Cén fáth an bhfuilimid ag fanacht chomh fada? Nach bhfuil an Taoiseach, atá ina chathaoirleach ar an gcomhchoiste atá ag cur na Straitéise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge i bhfeidhm, lán taobh thiar de láidriú Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla?Nach bhfuil na hAirí eile atá ar an gcomhchoiste sin lán taobh thiar de láidriú Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla? Dá bhrí sin, cén fáth an bhfuil sé ag tógáil chomh fada é a thabhairt isteach? Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil moltaí go leor déanta maidir le leasú Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla agus b’fhéidir go dtiocfaidh mé ar ais chuige sin ar ball beag. Ceann de na bunphrionsabal a gcaithfear glacadh leis ná nach bhfuil córas na scéimeanna ag obair. Tá sé iontach soiléir nach bhfuil Ranna Stáit ag cur i bhfeidhm na rialacháin agus an dlí ó thaobh chur i bhfeidhm na scéimeanna de. Tá sé rí-shoiléir nach bhfuil na comhlachtaí poiblí ag cur i bhfeidhm a gcuid dualgas ó thaobh na scéimeanna. Tá cuid mhaith de na scéimeanna imithe in éag le fada an lá. Go deimhin, bhí locht ar chuid mhaith de na Ranna Stáit nár thóg a scéimeanna suas go dáta. Is é sin an méid atá ar pháipéar. Go praiticiúil, má ghlaonn duine suas ag lorg seirbhíse ó rannóg Stáit ar bith, ó chomhairle contae nó ó chomhlacht poiblí, tá sé fíor-dheacair seirbhís chomhchaighdeánach a fháil trí mheán na Gaeilge is a bhfaigheadh duine trí mheán an Bhéarla. Nílimid ag déanamh aon dul chun cinn suntasach ansin. Más tada é, táimid ag cúlú. Ba náireach an rud é nach raibh sé i dtéarmaí tagartha an cheapacháin do phríomhoifigeach Roinn an Aire Stáit féin go gcaithfeadh líofacht Gaeilge a bheith ag an té a bheadh i gceist. Nílim ag cur aon rud i leith an duine atá ceaptha. Bhí an dualgas ar an Roinn na coinníollacha a leagadh síos ó thaobh cúrsaí fostaíochta agus ba cheart go mbeadh an duine atá i gceannas ar an rannóg atá i bhfeighil ar chúrsaí Gaeilge in ann an obair a dhéanamh go líofa trí mheán na Gaeilge. Tá ganntanas foirne i rannóg an Aire Stáit féin. Bím ag caint agus ag déileáil le na hoifigigh. Tá daoine fíor-chumasacha agus fíor-oibleagáideacha ag obair i Roinn na Gaeltachta. An rud a thuigim ná go gcuirtear breis dualgas orthu gan breis foirne nó breis acmhainní a chur ar fáil. Tá géarghá breathnú ar na hacmhainní atá ar fáil i rannóg an Aire Stáit maidir leis sin. Mar a deirtear i mBéarla, is ar life support atá Údarás na Gaeltachta le roinnt blianta anuas. Ní raibh sé ábalta mórán gníomhaíochtaí a dhéanamh ar an talamh le hais mar a bhí sna blianta roimhe de bharr na gciorruithe a rinneadh. Tá an-obair ar bun ag na comharchumann Gaeltachta agus na comhlachtaí pobalbhunaithe. Tá an-obair ar bun sna naíonraí. Is gá breis tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh sin. Tuigim go bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire Stáit tacú leis na comharchumann, ach tá géarghá leis an obair fhorbartha phobail sin. Caithfear tacaíocht airgid agus tacaíocht d'áiseanna a thaispeáint. Tá géarchéim sna naíonraí, ní hamháin maidir leis an nGaeilge agus cúrsaí teanga, ach i gcúrsaí naíonraí i gcoitinne ar fud na tíre mar gheall ar na coinníollacha fostaíochta atá ar chúramóirí leanaí. Sílim gur cheart don Aire Stáit bualadh leis an Aire Leanaí agus Gnóthaí Óige leis an gceist sin a phlé. Tá géarchéim ann i ndaoine a earcú sna naíonraí Gaeltachta ar fud na tíre mar gheall ar chúrsaí teanga agus fostaíochta. Tá deacrachtaí againn i gcúrsaí fostaíochta. Níl aon dabht faoi. Fiú tríd na blianta deacra, is léir go bhfuair an IDA Ireland agus Enterprise Ireland ardú as cuimse ina mbuiséid chun fostaíocht a chruthú mar tuigeadh go raibh gá go ndíreofaí ar chúrsaí fostaíochta a fhorbairt. Ní bhfuair Údarás na Gaeltachta an cineál méadú céanna. Tá géarghá aige le breis acmhainní le gur féidir leis postanna a chruthú. Tóg mar shampla Iorras Aintheach, gar do mo cheantar féin. Teastaíonn plean gníomhaíochta faoi leith do cheantracha cosúil le hIorras Aintheach. Tá an áit bánaithe. Tá na scoileanna i mbaol dúnadh. Tá an óige ag imeacht as. Sílim go raibh seachtar a bhí ag imirt ar fhoireann shinsear Charna-Caiseal dhá bhliain ó shin anois imithe thar sáile agus imithe ón bhfoireann. Níl aon duine ag fanacht thiar ann. Ní tharlóidh rudaí díreach astu féin. Dar liomsa, caithfidh an tAire Stáit treoir a thabhairt d'Údarás na Gaeltachta le plean gníomhaíochta nó task force a chur ar bun do cheantracha sna Gaeltachtaí cosúil le hIorras Aintheach le go dtiocfaidh athrú ar an scéal sin. Bheadh ceist agam chomh maith maidir le cuid de na comhlachtaí atá ag teacht isteach le tacaíocht ó Údarás na Gaeltachta maidir le na coinníollacha oibre atá ag na fostaithe sna comhlachtaí sin. Táimid ag feiceáil go bhfuil mí-úsáid, dar liomsa, á bhaint as daoine atá ar phá an-íseal in áiteanna nach í Gaeilge teanga oibre na n-ionad agus mar sin de. Sílim gur fiú iompar a phlé. Tá dul chun cinn á dhéanamh air sin ach bhí deacrachtaí móra ag baint leis. Molaim an tAire Stáit ar chúrsaí aerthaistil. Is cosúil go bhfuil rudaí socraithe beag nó mór ansin, ach tá fadhb fós ann maidir leis na heitiltí neamh-PSO agus an costas atá á ghearradh ar dhaoine. An bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit rud éigin a rá faoi sin? Is gá plé breise a dhéanamh air sin. Maidir le fostaíocht sa Státseirbhís, caithfear díriú air sin chun i bhfad níos mó daoine le Gaeilge a fháil isteach sa Státseirbhís. Luaigh an tAire Stáit an clár tacaíochta teaghlaigh. Ní chloisim duine, clann nó tuismitheoir ar bith ar an talamh ag caint faoin gclár tacaíochta teaghlaigh. Cé mhéad teaghlach atá páirteach sa scéim sin, céard go díreach a fhaigheann siad mar chuid den scéim agus cén leas nó buntáiste atá ann dóibh? Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt d'eagraíocht amháin, Tuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta, atá ag déanamh sár-obair. Go deimhin, tá cuid mhaith de na heagraíochtaí pobail atá luaite go dtí seo, Conradh na Gaeilge, an tOireachtas agus na dreamanna eile ar fad, ag déanamh an-obair. Tá Tuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta ag déanamh oibre, agus cuid mhaith acu á déanamh dóibh go deonach. Tá géarghá ansin le breis tacaíochta. Is féidir an toradh a fheiceáil ar an obair a dhéanann sé. D'fhéadfainn coinneáil orm ar feadh ocht nóiméad eile. Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh an tAire Stáit ar ais le go mbeidh díospóireacht againn go rialta faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge. Tabharfaidh mise tacaíocht dó chun cúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn, ach beidh mé ina dhiaidh muna bhfuil tacaíocht á tabhairt do na rudaí cuí. Sílim go gcaithfimid dul i ndiaidh gach duine sa Rialtas, go háirid iad siúd atá ag rá go bhfuil siad báúil don Ghaeilge, chun lámh a chur ina bpóca, áiseanna a chur ar fáil agus airgead a chur ar fáil. Ní fiú a bheith ag caint air. Caithfidh siad airgead a thabhairt agus maoiniú a thabhairt chun na rudaí seo a chur i gcrích. Ní féidir leis an Aire Stáit é a dhéanamh leis féin. Tacóimid leis ach, chomh maith céanna, beimid criticiúil muna bhfuil na spriocanna á bhaint amach.

My daughter goes to a Gaelscoil, purely because I realised the disadvantage I was at. I would love to be able to speak my native language. When I was running for president of the Trinity College Dublin Students Union, I was very intimidated when I was invited to the Irish hustings, knowing the level and standard of education my fellow candidates had received. I knew their standard of Irish would be much better than mine. I received permission at the time for my daughter to go on the hustings for me. She was seven or eight years of age at the time. I was very proud to watch her in action and that she was able to speak the language so fluently, eloquently and with confidence. My only fear is, when she leaves school, will she be able to continue to speak the language outside the education system, especially since she has a parent who does not speak the language. That is from where my main contribution comes on how we support families for whom Irish is not their first language or who even regularly use it within the house. It is about how we support communities, youth clubs and local sports clubs to be bilingual in order that, when my daughter leaves the classroom or secondary school and is engaging in other activities, there will be other opportunities for her to use the language. The city is really poor at providing such activities. The level of Irish I attained in school was very poor. It is a shame and something at which we need to look in conjunction with the Minister of State's Department and the Department of Education and Skills to overhaul completely how Irish is taugh in mainstream schools. Not only does it leave a person at a disadvantage but I also see the number of people from working-class and disadvantaged backgrounds who lack Irish. It acts as a barrier for them in being able to become primary or secondary school teachers, act as role models within their communities and go back and teach in schools. I look forward to seeing how we can change the school system in order that people from working class backgrounds will be able to leave school with a decent level of Irish and become teachers, particularly DEIS schools in which generally the level of attainment in the Irish language is of a poor standard. It also concerned me in recent months when my eldest daughter who unlike her younger sister is in a DEIS school rather than a Gaelscoil came home to inform me that she had not been taught Irish for two months. She is in her leaving certificate year. I was absolutely appalled and very upset because she was obviously getting ready for her leaving certificate examinations. When I brought the issue to the school, I was told about the struggle it had in trying to find substitute Irish language teachers and the fact that there were no substitutes available to come to the school to teach the Irish language.There is a very poor record in kids moving on to third level education from DEIS schools, but the disadvantage at which she has been left on top of it, in missing out on two months of the Irish curriculum because of the apparent lack of substitute teachers, is of real concern. The other aspect of the Irish language education system that needs to be addressed is the shortage of non-denominational Gaelscoileanna throughout the country. There is not one non-denominational Gaelscoil in north Dublin, depriving parents whose children have not been baptised of the right to have their children educated through the Irish language. Last year more than 1,500 parents in north Dublin signed a petition calling for the establishment of a non-denominational Gaelscoil, but the patronage was awarded to Educate Together. As Ireland becomes more and more a secular country, we must give parents whose children have not been baptised the option of having their children educated through Irish. I know that all of my contributions have been heavily focused on the education system, but what concerns me as a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills are the moves by some advocates for whom Irish is their first language to give preference within the Gaelscoil system to Irish language speakers. On the one hand, I fully support holding places for those for whom Irish is their first and only language in the home, but some advocates are moving towards preference being given where Irish is spoken in the home, that is to say, households in which a parent attended an Irish school but does not necessarily use the language anymore, perhaps since he or she left secondary school. I have a fear that those children will be placed ahead of children from the locality. I know that in the Irish schools in Tallaght there has been a massive shift in how our children can progress when taught through Irish. I am not sure why or how the education received in Irish schools is of a better standard than in English language schools next door, but it is and it gives the children a head start. We see some kids from DEIS schools passing through the Gaelscoil and doing a lot better in progressing on to third level education. We need to look at how the Irish language increases access to third level for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and how we can enhance it. We also need to ensure children who are not from the locality do not skip the queue just because a parent happened to attend an Irish school. That is all I have to say on the issue. I will read the statements made tomorrow and seek a translation of them.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	147	Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh Gníomhach. Lá breá brothallach a bhí ann. Chuaigh mé féin agus mo chlann go dtí an trá. Bhí an ghrian ag taitneamh sa spéir. D'itheamar uachtar reoite. Chuamar abhaile agus d'inis mé an scéal ar fad do mo Mhamaí. Dá gcuirfí ceist ar an gnáthdhuine in Éirinn, déarfainn gurb iad sin na príomhabairtí gur féidir leo labhairt trí Ghaeilge tar éis dóibh 14 bliana a bheith ag foghlaim na Gaeilge ar scoil. Ní cúis ionaidh é ach is cúis díoma é sin do mo leithéidse a chaith tréimhse mhaith ag foghlaim na Gaeilge. Idir bhunscoil agus mheanscoil Béarla a bhí mar scoil agamsa ach d'fhreastal mé ar Ghaelscoil ar feadh bliain amháin agus mé sa seú rang. Rinne mé céim sa Ghaeilge sa triú leibhéal. Is í an fhadhb atá ann ná fadhb mheoin nó fadhb dhearcaidh, is é sin an dearcadh atá ag na foghlaimeoirí. Tá siad beag beann ar an nGaeilge mar ábhar. B'fhéidir go bhfuil fadhb ann ó thaobh an mhodha mhúinte atá againn sa chóras. É sin leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Ruane ó thaobh múinteoirí de ó áiteanna faoi mhíbhuntáiste. Aontaím go huile is go hiomlán léi. Ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Aire Stáit, ó thaobh scéim atá curtha ar bun agamsa, ag Marino Institute of Education agus ag Northside Partnership i mo cheantar féin, go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh go mbeadh seans ag daltaí faoi mhíbhuntáise agus atá ag freastal ar scoileanna DEIS a bheith mar mhúinteoirí bunscoile. Tá an Ghaeilge ag feidhmiú mar chonstaic dóibhsean. Ní fhaigheann siad an deis uaireanta sna scoileanna sin Gaeilge ardleibhéil a dhéanamh toisc nach bhfuil na múinteoirí ann chun an leibhéal sin a thabhairt dóibh. Ní hamháin sin ach ní bhíonn an bhéim curtha ar chursaí Gaeilge sna gnáthbunscoile faoi míbhuntáiste, mar is iad an litríocht agus an Béarla na rudaí is tábhachtaí. Tá an Ghaeilge curtha síos an liosta ó thaobh na rudaí atá tábhachtach. Tá sé mar mhíbhuntáiste ag na daltaí sin agus iad ag dul ar aghaidh má tá siad ag iarraidh a bheith mar mhúinteoirí bunscoile. Mar sin, an fhadhb atá ann i láthair na huaire ná go bhfuil gnáthdaoine meanaicme atá againne mar mhúinteoirí bunscoile. Tá an ról sin agus an ionsparáid sin, go bhféadfadh páistí ó na scoileanna sin a thabhairt do pháistí eile i scoileanna DEIS, caillte againn. Sin í an fhadhb atá ann. Tá scéim curtha ar bun againne i Marino ceachtanna Gaeilge a thabhairt do dhaltaí meanscoile ionas go mbeidh siad in ann Gaeilge ardteistiméireachta a dhéanamh ar ardleibhéal ionas go bhféadfadh siad dul ar aghaidh sna coláistí traenála. Tá meon eile atá tábhachtach a athrú maidir leis an gceist seo agus sin meon na nGaeilgeoirí. Má chuirtear smaoineamh eile chun cinn ó thaobh an dóigh gur féidir an córas sin a athrú, faightear teachtaireachtaí ó fud na tíre go bhfuil Cromwell eile tagtha ar an bhfód a bhfuil ag iarraidh cosc a chur ar ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge. Is é an caighdéan atá ag múinteoirí agus iad ag fágáil na coláistí traenála atá i bhfad níos tábhachtaí ná an caighdeán Gaeilge a bheadh acusan agus iad ag dul isteach sna coláistí sin. Sin an pointe atá mé ag iarraidh é a dhéanamh. Níl an cheist faoi chúrsaí Gaeltachta agus cúrsaí Gaeilge. Is é an ról atá ag an Aire Stáit, is dócha, an Ghaeltacht a chur chun cinn, tionscail a tharraingt chun na Gaeltachta agus fostaíocht a aimsiú don Ghaeltacht agus mar sin de. Is sórt forbartha réigiúnaí atá i gceist ag an Aire Stáit. Is ceist iomlán difriúil cur chun cinn na Gaeilge. Má táimid chun bheith dáiríre faoin teanga is teip mhór mhillteach í múineadh na Gaeilge agus múineadh teanga i gcoitinne inár gcóras. Tá smaoineamh agam don Aire Stáit faoin ngnáthscoil bunleibhéal. Dá ndéanfaimis rang a dó agus rang a trí go huile is go hiomlán trí Ghaeilge as seo amach i ngach aon scoil, cén sórt caighdeán Gaeilge a bheadh ag gach dalta scoile agus iad ag fágáil na scoile? Nó b'fhéidir rang a haon agus rang a dó. In ionad dream ag fáil caighdeáin mhaith sna Gaelscoileanna agus dream eile ag fáil drochchaighdeáin sna gnáthscoileanna. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé ró-réabhlóideach mar smaoineamh. Ach má táimid dáiríre faoi cheist na Gaeilge, dá mbeadh seans ag gach aon dalta gach uile ábhar a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge i rang a dó agus rang a trí, bheadh caighdeán iontach níos fearr agus níos saibhre Gaeilge acu agus iad ag dul ar aghaidh chuig an cúigiú rang, an séú rang agus an meánscoil. Téann sé ar aghaidh go dtí na ceisteanna ó thaobh fhoghlaim teangacha i gcoitinne, ar nós Fraincís, Spáinis agus Gearmáinis. Is teip mhór mhillteach í sin inár gcóras chomh mhaith ó thaobh na dteangacha eile sin. Ritheann sé liom nach bhfuilimid dáiríre faoi theangacha a mhúineadh i gceart. Tá mé chun críochnú anois. Tá dhá rud gur maith liom a rá arís, go bhfuil constaic agus teorainn, nó balla más maith leat, ansin atá curtha i dtreo páistí bochta atá ag iarraidh a bheith mar mhúinteoirí bunscoile. Is í an Ghaeilge chuid den bhalla sin agus caithfimid bheith ionraic agus macánta faoi sin. Agus sa chóras i gcoitinne, caithfimid bheith i bhfad níos réabhlóidí. B'fhéidir dá ndéanfaimis an rud ar fad trí Ghaeilge i rang a dó, rang a trí agus rang a ceathair nó cibé rang ar feadh bliana go mbeadh seans i bhfad níos fearr ann an fhadhb seo a réiteach.Caithfidh lucht na Gaeilge gan a bheith chomh ardnósach sin agus gan teachtaireachtaí a chur chugamsa agus chuig daoine eile. Tá fáth ann go nglaoitear an Taliban orthu. Is cuma cén sórt plé a bhíonn ag duine faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge, mura n-aontaíonn sé nó sí go huile is go hiomlán leis na tuairimí atá acusan ó thaobh ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge, is ionann an duine sin agus Cromwell. Faighimse na e-mails seo. Tá an meon atá acu dochreidte. Is féidir leo fanacht mar sin, is féidir leo leanúint leis an meon sin, ach ní chabhraíonn sé le gluaiseacht na Gaeilge. É sin ráite, is beag seans go mbeidh mé ag dul go dtí an trá inniu, toisc go bhfuil an lá chomh uafásach sin, ach beidh mé ag insint an scéil seo ar fad de mo Mhamaí ar ball.

Ar dtús báire, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit. Is seanchara liom é agus tá an-mheas agam ar a chuid oibre díograisí ar son na teanga mar Aire Stáit le freagracht as an nGaeltacht. Is fiú Gaeilge a labhairt agus a choimeád beo. Tá ár n-oidhreacht, ár stair, ár litríocht, ár mbéaloideas, ár gcultúr agus, ar ndóigh, ár n-anamacha measctha inár dteanga. Mar a deireann an Aire Stáit, is í an Ghaeilge ceann de na hacmhainní nadúrtha is luachmhara atá againn. Tá dualgas faoi leith orainn mar Bhaill den Oireachtas iarracht a dhéanamh triail a bhaint as an nGaeilge agus dea-shampla, agus cineál ceannaireachta, a thabhairt maidir le labhairt na teanga. Tá dualgas orainn níos mó iarracht a dhéanamh go foirmeálta agus go neamhfhoirmeálta. Ar dtús ba mhaith liom dea-obair Fhoras na Gaeilge agus an príomhfheidmeannach díograiseach atá ansin, Éamonn Ó hArgáin, a mholadh. Cabhraíonn Foras na Gaeilge le Gaelscoileanna Teoranta, Gael Linn, Glór na nGael, Oireachtas na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge agus Cummann na bhFiann, tá foclóir nua agus polasaí oideachais Gaeltachta á gcur amach ag an bhforas agus tugann sé tacaíocht do scoileanna. Tá sé ag déanamh sároibre agus is maith an rud é go bhfuilimid ag tabhairt níos mó tacaíochta agus acmhainní dó. Molaim don Aire Stáit an-bhéim a chur ar aos óg na Galltachta chun iad a mhealladh don Ghaeltacht i rith an tsamhraidh. Sílim go bhfuil sé sin iontach tábhachtach. Ba ar mo chuairteanna féin don Ghaeltacht, nuair a bhí mé óg, a bhfuair mé mo ghrá don teanga agus molaim don Aire Stáit an-bhéim a chur air sin. Sílim go bhfuil níos mó le déanamh ansin, b'fhéidir deontais níos fearr a dhíriú ar na daltaí, níos mó fógraíochta agus daoine ag teacht isteach sna scoileanna. Molaim don Aire Stáit an iarracht sin a chur i bhfeidhm agus is fiú é a dhéanamh. Is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil athrú sa bhuiséad. Tá beagnach €8 milliún ann don Ghaeltacht agus €4 mhilliún ann chun an Ghaeilge a chruthú i gceantair taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Is cúis áthais orm go bhfuil an Aire Stáit dóchasach go bhfuil na ciorruithe thart. Aontaíom go hiomlán leis an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Gaeilge 2010-2030 agus na haidhmeanna atá ann agus í á cur i gcrích. Caithfimid an méid daoine a labhraíonn Gaeilge a mhéadú, fiú amháin sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá fócas an Rialtais dírithe air sin. Tá béim ar an teanga labhartha ann in Acht na Gaeltachta 2012. Tá níos mó áiseanna agus tacaíocht do scoileanna chun na haidhmeanna sin a chur i bhfeidhm agus is fiú é sin a dhéanamh. Táim féin sásta go bhfuil 40% de mharcanna san ardteistiméireacht ag dul don teanga labhartha anois agus is fiú é sin a choimeád. Aontaím le Seanadóir Ó Ríordáin go bhfuil athruithe sa chóras oideachais, sa mhodhanna múinteoireachta agus sa churaclam riachtanach. Is fiú an cheist sin a ghrinnscrúdú agus molaim é sin don Aire. Sílim go bhfuil RTE, TG4 agus Ráidío na Gaeltachta ag déanamh sárobair chun an Ghaeilge a chruthú agus a fhorbairt. Tá na cláir den chéad scoth ag déanamh an jab sin agus tá siad riachtanach. Tá TG4 an-cháiliúil agus baineann cuid mhaith daoine triail as sin anois.  Mar fhocal scoir, is fiú an dhíospóireacht seo, agus táim iontach sásta go bhfuil sé ar siúl. Tar éis an dhíospóireacht seo tá dualgas orainn go léir sa Teach seo níos mó iarrachtaí a dhéanamh ag dul ar aghaidh, Gaeilge a labhairt aon uair is féidir linn go foirmeálta agus go neamhfhoirmeálta taobh amuigh den seomra seo. Tá Conradh na Gaeilge ag déanamh jab maith ag cruthú Gaeilge ina maidneacha caife agus a leithéid agus ba chóir dúinn tacaíocht a thabhairt dó sin. Is iontach an dhíospóireacht seo. Tá a lán le déanamh, go háirithe sa chóras oideachais, le daoine óga ón nGalltacht a mhealladh don Ghaeltacht i rith an tsamhraidh agus níos mó triail a bhaint as an teanga sa ghnáthlá.

Tá tú ag déanamh jab fíor-mhaith. Is mór an trua gur ghlac an tAire Stáit an méid sin ama chun teacht os ár gcomhair ach, ar aon nós, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimhe. Táimid fíor-bhuíoch go bhfuilimid in ann na cúrsaí seo a phlé leis inniu, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Reilly. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an seal againn é a dhéanamh níos minice ó seo amach. Ar dtús báire, bhí mé ag breacadh síos cúpla nóta ansin de réir agus a bhí an dhíospóireacht ag dul ar aghaidh agus a bhí níos mó ionchuir ag na Baill anseo. Ní aontaím le roinnt a dúirt Seanadóir Ó Ríordáin ní ba luaithe. Caithfidh mé a rá, má bhain duine ar bith eile úsáid as a leithéid sin de théarmaí, cosúil le Taliban, le cur síos ar phobal áirithe, bheadh an Seanadóir céanna istigh anseo ag bualadh a dhruma le dul viral ar an Idirlíon ag seasamh suas ina éadan. Chuir sin iontas orm agus baineadh geit asam nuair a chuala mé a leithéid de Sheanadóir ag cur síos ar Ghaeilgeoirí mar sin. Ní sin an pobal a aithním. Aithním pobal thar a bheith spraoiúil, spreagtha, fáiltiúil agus tiománta ó thaobh feabhas a chur ar-----

Caithfimid fanacht. Tá vótáil ag teastáil sa Dháil. An bhfuil an tAire Stáit ceart go leor? Tá. Ar aghaidh leis an Seanadóir.
#NiallODonnghaile	unknown-#NiallODonnghaile-party	unknown-#NiallODonnghaile-dob	unknown-#NiallODonnghaile-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	151	Déanfaidh. Ach ar aon nós, tá sin ráite agam cheana féin. Rud eile a dúirt an Seanadóir ná an ról atá ag an Aire Stáit. Is Aire Stáit é le freagracht as níos mó ná an Ghaeltacht amháin. Tá sé sa Roinn is atá sé. Is léir ón ráiteas a rinne sé inné go bhfuil sé dírithe ar i bhfad níos mó ná cursaí réigiúnacha agus Gaeltachta amháin. Níl a fhios agam ar chuala sé uaim riamh ar Fhoras na Gaeilge. Tá tosaíochtaí agus freagrachtaí ar leith ag a Roinn ó thaobh Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta agus na comhlachtaí tras-Teorainn. Is é Foras na Gaeilge, dár ndóigh, an ceann acu is tábhachtaí sa chás seo. Bhí cineál díoma orm nár luaigh sé ról an fhorais agus an tábhacht a bhaineann leis na grúpaí tras-Teorainn sin. Mar is eol dó, ní aithníonn an Ghaeilge, nó aon teanga eile, teorainn ar bith. Tá sé ag bláthú agus ag fás, tá súil againn, níos leithne ná istigh sa Ghaeltacht amháin. Sílim go bhfuil dea-shampla d'athbheochan agus dul chun cinn na Gaeilge sa Tuaisceart agus gur féidir le grúpaí Gaeilge, agus iad siúd atá sáite i saol na Gaeilge, roinnt mhaith a fhoghlaim ó na Sé Chontae maidir leis an méid atá ráite agus na hábhair ar luaigh Seanadóirí eile roimh ré. Tá cúpla rud gasta eile le chur chuig an Aire ó thaobh an ábhair sin. Luaigh roinnt daoine an thábhacht a bhaineann leis an Ghaeloideacheas agus líon na múinteoirí. Ó Thuaidh tá cúrsa ollscoile ann i gColáiste Mhuire atá tiomanta agus dírithe isteach ar mhúinteoirí a thraeneáil chun dul isteach san earnáil Gaeloideachais, chun cur le Gaeloideachas agus foghlaim trí mheán na Gaeilge. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil amhlaidh ó Dheas. Chomh mhaith leis sin tá ciste infheistíochta againn ó Thuaidh, rud a chuireann deontais dhíreacha caipitil isteach chun cultúrlanna agus ionaid phobail a thógáil, áiteanna a chuireann le saol cultúrtha na Gaeilge agus a chuireann béim ollmhór ar fhorbairt an teanga agus a chuidíonn léi. Caithfidh mé a rá nach raibh mórán airgid i gceist leis an chiste sin ar dtús báire, ach le cuidiú roinnt chomhairlí cathrach agus comhairlí áitiúla tá an ciste sin ann. Is léir go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach agus gur cineál game changer é in athbheochán na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh. Tá cultúrlanna spreagtha in airde anois anuraidh i nDoire, in Ard Mhácha agus san Iúr agus sílim gur dea-shampla é sin chomh mhaith. Rud eile atá againn ó Thuaidh, agus seans gur féidir leis an Aire Stáit smaoineamh faoi seo, ná an tionscadal Líofa. Tá sé glactha ag an gCumann Lúthchleas Gael agus tá sé ag rith leis ar bhonn uile-Éireann. Tháinig an tionscadal ar an saol in 2011 chun 1,000 daoine a chlarú chun a bheith líofa roimh 2015. Anois sílim go breis agus 15,000 daoine cláraithe leis an tionscadal. Bhí giota conspóid faoi seo, ag tá sé ag cur spárantachtaí ar fáil chun daoine óga a chur chun na Gaeltachta. Seo uilig dea-shampla. Níl sé foirfe. Is féidir linn cur leis, ach sílim go bhfuil sé ina dhea-shampla. Maidir leis an Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas - agus tá fhios agam go bhfuil Airí ann faoi láthair ach tá an toghchán os ár gcomhair ó Thuaidh - nuair a thagann na hinstitiúidí ar ais, an mbeidh an tAire Stáit ag comhoibriú leis an Fheidhmeannacht ionas gur féidir linn an cineál dea-chleachtadh seo a roinnt, gur féidir linn foghlaim óna chéile agus, dar ndóigh, gur féidir linn seasamh le chéile chun aithint go bhfuil an Ghaeilge thar a bheith tábhachtach agus gur ceart dúinn uilig seasamh chun meas a léiriú don teanga sin agus chun seasamh in éadan dímheasa nó ionsaithe ar bith, is cuma cén cuid nó píosa den tír ina bhfuilimid?
#MariaByrne	unknown-#MariaByrne-party	unknown-#MariaByrne-dob	unknown-#MariaByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	152	Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh Gníomhach. Cuirim céad fáilte chuig an ócáid seo roimh an Aire Stáit. Tá múinteoirí na tíre fíorbhródúil as an nGaeilge agus an cultúr Gaelach. Tá dualgas orainn uile tacú lenár dtraidisiúin. As my colleague referred to, according to the 2011 census of population, more than 77,000 people speak the Irish language daily. Of these, approximately 23,000 speak it in Gaeltacht areas and one in every four people in Ireland never speaks it. Funding is provided for Irish language courses in third level institutes here and 43 colleges abroad. In fact, more funding goes abroad than stays in Ireland, with the majority going to America, Canada and Britain but also to France, Slovenia and Sweden. The demand for Irish in technology is growing. That Google, Facebook and all of the social media services now have apps is very much to be welcomed. The use of the Irish language is something with which we have struggled for many years and it seems that for every step forward in encouraging it, our dependence on English pushes us back. I know from my experience that I am able to understand Irish a lot more than I am able to speak it, which stems from a lack of practice. It is incumbent on all of us to try to practise it and use a few words of Gaeilge every day. Thankfully, it is still very much a living language in some areas of the country and flourishing in new ways we could not have predicted ten years ago. Now we have the help of technology. There is an app which teaches a person to speak it, whether he or she is in Ireland or abroad. I recently downloaded the app and have started to practise some of the lines. It is a very good tool in giving someone an ear for the Irish language. There is also a marked interest in Gaeilge abroad, with many foreign universities offering Irish language courses which are popular with those who have Irish ancestry. It is very important that we continue to offer funding where we can support these initiatives and encourage the involvement of the diaspora and second and third generation Irish in our culture. Although many carry enthusiasm and a love for the Irish language, we cannot ignore those who believe Irish has no real use beyond the education system. It is important that we do not let this attitude continue among younger generations. The utmost support should be given in providing funding, developing new initiatives and ways of teaching the language and maximising student engagement from a young age in both the spoken and written word. How do we increase the use of the Irish language? There is a proven demand for places in Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí. I have been chairperson of a Gaelcholáiste in Limerick in recent years. There are five Gaelscoileanna but only two all-Irish schools. One is an all girls school, while the other is a co-educational school. Certainly, we need to see greater encouragement of second level schools to meet the demands of those in primary schools. Senator Lynn Ruane spoke about the fact that not many Irish teachers applied for the jobs available. We have had the opposite experience in that there is an oversubscription of teachers applying for the jobs available, which is good. Like anything in life, encouraging people at a young age is the way to go. I have some suggestions to make on ways to aid promotion of the Irish language. Perhaps we might supplement Irish language advertising costs on radio. Some 80% of adults listen to the radio. We should encourage the development and use of apps in Irish. There are Irish language translators in the European Parliament and it is great to hear Irish members using the language on the floor of that institution. This shows that there are jobs which could be created. We should encourage the transmission of Irish language cartoons on non-Irish channels. Folk tales in Irish for children is possibly a way to go. According to the 20-year strategy for the Irish language, the aim of Government policy is to increase the number of families who use Irish as a daily language, to provide linguistic support in the Gaeltacht, to ensure that in public discourse and public services the use of Irish or English will, as far as practical, be a choice for the citizen to make and to ensure the use of Irish will become more visible in our society, both as a spoken language by itizens and also in areas such as signage and literature.  Mar a deireann an seanfhocal, ní neart go cur le chéile.
#GraceOSullivan	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-party	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-dob	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	153	Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh Gníomhach. I welcome the Minister of State. Like so many Irish people of my generation who grew up in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, my level of Irish is very poor. Similar to Senator Lynn Ruane, if I was to try to even read this statement in Irish, I would have my fellow Senators rolling around the floor laughing. As much as that would be great fun, I might lose the points I want to make. It is highly embarrassing for me, as an Irish citizen and passport holder, to have no great ability to speak our language. I speak Dutch and Spanish and have lived abroad. Like many of my generation, I went away at the age of 20 years and came back fluent in Dutch and Spanish. At home my children who have grown up in the Irish system speak Spanish fluently and have very good Dutch but only have a cupla focal of Irish. It is such an embarrassment. I support what my Civil Engagement colleague, Senator Lynn Ruane, said. She made a number of suggestions. The way Irish is taught in school leaves a lot to be desired. I implore the Government and the Minister of State who I know is learning Irish to do whatever they can to have Irish taught as a conversational language.We really are losing out as a nation. Since my election as a Senator earlier last year, I have been working on learning the language. I attended the Fleadh Cheoil in Ennis this year where I enjoyed a conversational Irish course which was absolutely brilliant. The event was organised by volunteers. Not only was it about teaching the language, it was also about cultural appreciation. It was ceol, caint agus craic. The pubs were thriving and the atmosphere was brilliant. That is really good and encourages the use of Irish on the streets and in the cities. It also enables tourists to see the beauty of our culture. The Green Party is a proud supporter of the Irish language and has been since its foundation. We have always considered the approach that Irish is a living language as the way to go. We recently established an Irish version of our website and have been nominated for an Irish language web award. We are proud of our tradition in the Green Party as Gaeilgeoirs. There are other people like me who have a long way to go. I have messages from members of the Civil Engagement group. Senator Alice-Mary Higgins who is from Galway asked me today to state she would like to see greater support in Gaeltacht areas. I am from County Waterford and ask that greater support be given in the areas of Helvick and An Rinn. Senator Frances Black is from County Donegal and would like to see more support for the Gaeltacht areas there. It is my hope that reintroducing Irish as a conversational language will be promoted as best as possible by the Minister of State and the Government and that whatever resources are needed in that regard will be provided. Let us set a target for a few years’ time for people like me and other Senators who lack confidence in order that, with the Minister of State’s support, we will to be able to make a better stab at use of the language than I have just made.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	154	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí uile a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo. Aithníonn muid uile go bhfuil go leor le déanamh faoin straitéis agus ní mór dúinn a aithint chomh maith go bhfuil go leor déanta againn cheana féin. Mar a dúirt mé níos túisce, bhí an tionscadal uaillmhianach seo faoi mhíbhuntáiste ón tús. Tá mise, mar Aire Stáit do ghnóthaí Gaeltachta, dóchasach anois go bhfuil ré na gciorruithe thart agus go bhfuil breis airgid le feiceáil sna buiséid sheasmhacha a aontaíodh do 2016 agus 2017. Tá sé ráite ag chuile dhuine go dteastaíonn níos mó airgid, agus aontaím leo. Tá mé ag déanamh mo dhícheall breis airgid agus breis acmhainní a fháil don teanga. Is é sin an príomhrud gur mhaith liom a rá. Maidir le smaointe na Seanadóirí, cuirim fáilte roimh an Seanadóir Ardagh, an t-aon Sheanadóir amhain ó Fhianna Fáil a labhair. Aontaím léi go bhfuil Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin agus chuile pháirtí go leor i bhfabhar ár dteanga náisiúnta. An príomhrud a rinne muidne don teanga nuair a tháinig muid isteach in 2011 leis an Páirtí Lucht Oibre ná go rabhamar in ann eacnamaíocht na tíre a shábháil, cé go raibh sé chomh dona sin in 2011. Bhí ar chuile Aire agus Roinn laghdú a dhéanamh ar a mbuiséid. Tá ceist agamsa. Chuir mé an cheist seo ar dhaoine sinsearacha i bhFianna Fáil ach ní bhfuair mé freagra riamh. Nuair a bhí an Celtic Tiger againn, nuair a bhí ardú suntasach sa mhéid daoine a bhí ag obair sa tseirbhís poiblí agus nuair a bhí airgead ann, cén fáth nach raibh níos mó daoine líofa le Gaeilge sa Státseirbhís? Ní bhfuair mé freagra ar an gceist agus nílim ag cur milleáin ar an Seanadóir Ardagh. Ní bhfuair mé freagra riamh ó aon duine i bhFianna Fáil ar an gceist sin. Aontaím léi go dteastaíonn níos mó a dhéanamh ionas go mbeidh níos mó daoine le Gaeilge sa Státseirbhís. Tá an Seanadóir Hopkins ceart go raibh ardú ar na buiséid do, mar shampla, Údarás na Gaeltachta ina bhuiséad caipitil agus buiséad reatha agus i mbuiséad reatha na Roinne freisin. Bhí laghdú sa bhfigiúr iomlán agus tá an Seanadóir Ardagh ceart faoi sin. An príomhfháth go raibh laghdú ann ná go bhfuaireamar €6 mhilliún sa bhuiséad caipitil ón Roinn Cumarsáide, Gníomhaithe ar son na hAeráide agus Comhshaoil i rith 2016 agus fuaireamar an t-airgead sin do thogra amháin do chéibh Inis Oírr. Tháinig an t-airgead sin isteach in 2016 agus ní rabhamar in ann é a chaitheamh sa bhliain sin. Is airgead mór é a bhfuaireamar ón Roinn eile. Seachas sin, bhí ardú ar chuile bhuiséid laistigh de mo Roinn in 2017. Bhíomar in ann breis airgid de €2.4 milliún a fháil, mar a dúirt mé, d'Údarás na Gaeltachta agus €750,000 d'Fhoras na Gaeilge sna Meastúcháin Athbhreithnithe in 2017. Freisin, chuireamar €250,000 ar fáil do chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise. Is torthaí maithe iad sin. Maidir leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh, bhí laghdú sa bhuiséad caipitil don údarás ar feadh blianta ó 2008, ó €26 mhilliún go €16 mhilliún go €10 milliún go €6 mhilliún. Tá ardú anois mar go rabhamar in ann é a ardú. Teastaíonn breis airgid agus tá an an t-údarás ag iarraidh breis airgid. Beidh an brú ormsa agus ar an Aire sinsearach breis airgid a fháil arís in 2018. Caithfidh mé a rá go raibh an bord, an cathaoirleach agus an príomhfheidhmeannach sásta go raibh ardú ann agus go bhfuair an t-údarás breis airgid in 2016. Beidh siad in ann é sin a úsáid in 2017. Tá plean teanga amháin foilsithe. Níor tháinig an plean ó Chois Fharraige os mo chomhair fós agus mar sin ní fhaca mé an dréacht. Tá an Seanadóir ceart go dteastaíonn acmhainní chun an plean sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Beidh suas go deich gcinn foilsithe roimh 2017. Go mórmhór i mbuiséad 2018, teastaíonn breis acmhainní chun na pleananna sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Is rud é sin a theastaíonn breis airgid. Tá sé pléite agam le feidhmeannaigh mo Roinne agus caithfimid an próiseas a thosnú go luath chun an tAire Caiteachais Poiblí agus Athchóirithe a chur ar an eolas faoi sin agus chuile dhuine eile laistigh de mo Roinn féin a chur ar an eolas freisin. Maidir le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, bhí Bille réidh le foilsiú roimh Nollaig 2015. Ní raibh an t-iarAire Stáit sásta agus ní raibh mise sásta é a fhoilsiú. Phléigh mé é seo le daoine sinsearacha ó Chonradh na Gaeilge agus leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga. Thóg mé comhairle uaidh. Tá a fhios agam nach raibh Sinn Féin nó Fianna Fáil sásta leis freisin nuair a bhí siad sa bhFreasúra faoin Rialtas deireanach. Mar sin, ní rabhamar sásta é a fhoilsiú. Mar a dúirt mé, tá mé ag fáil comhairle chun Bille níos láidre a ullmhú agus beimid á dhéanamh sin agus ag dul ar aghaidh leis an bpróiseas. Tá Ard-Rúnaí nua againn sa Roinn, Katherine Licken, agus cuirim fáilte roimpi. Tuigim as a bheith ag caint leis an Ard-Rúnaí nua go bhfuil neart Gaeilge aici. Feicfidh mé é sin amach anseo. Tuigim go bhfuil i gceist aici cuairt a thabhairt ar oifigí na Roinne agus ar Údarás na Gaeltachta sna Forbacha. Táim lán-mhuiníneach go bhfeicfidh daoine ina dhiaidh sin go bhfuil Gaeilge mhaith aici. Tá ceangal aici le na hOileáin Árann. Chaith a seanathair, sílim, 12 bhliain ar Inis Mór. Chaith sí cúpla seachtain i rith an tsamhraidh ar Inis Oírr nuair a bhí sí mar dhéagóir í fhéin. Tá grá aici don Ghaeilge agus tá sé ráite liom go mbeidh sí ag dul ar aghaidh chun í a fhoghlaim. Bhí an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh ag labhairt faoi easpa foirne. Tá daoine sinsearacha nua againn sa Roinn. Tá Aodhán Mac Cormaic, an stiúrthóir Gaeilge nua anseo, chomh maith le Micheál Ó Conaire, an príomhoifigeach nua.Tá daoine sinsearacha nua againn faoi láthair a bheidh ag brú ar aghaidh leis an teanga, le hAcht na Teangacha Oifigiúla agus leis an straitéis. Ó thaobh na smaointe faoi Iorras Aintheach, labhair mé leis an gcathaoirleach agus an príomhfheidhmeannach faoi sin agus má theastáionn treoir uathu beidh mé sásta é sin a dhéanamh más rud é gur cheapann siad gur ghá dúinn rud éigin a dhéanamh. B'fhéidir go labhróimid arís faoi Aer Arann. Bhí sé an-chasta ó thaobh an chonartha i rith an tsamhraidh seo caite. Bhí an-obair déanta ag na feidhmeannaigh sa Roinn agus san Oifig um Sholáthar Rialtais ó thaobh an chonartha. Is é an rud is tábhachtaí anois ná go mbeidh cinnteacht go bhfuil seirbhís ó seo amach go dtí deireadh 2020. Bhí an Seanadóir Ruane ag caint faoin gcaighdeán oideachais agus an chaoi ina bhfuil an Stát ag múineadh na Gaeilge. Tá an méid a dúirt sí faoin scoil DEIS sin a bhí gan múinteoir Gaeilge ar feadh dhá mhí an-aisteach. Ba cheart nach dtarlaíonn é sin. Bhí an Seanadóir O'Sullivan freisin ag caint faoin gcaoi a mhúintear an Ghaeilge. Tá fhios agam go raibh athrú maidir le marcanna don Ghaeilge san ardteistiméireacht agus táimid ag dul sa treo ceart. Sílim go bhfuil fadhb ó thaobh an líon múinteoirí a bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Tarlaíonn sé sa bhunscoil agus sa mheánscoil freisin. Ó thaobh an phlean Gaeltachta, tá an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna chun breis acmhainní a chur isteach chun caighdeán Gaeilge na múinteoirí a ardú. Seo rud atá fíorthábhachtach agus tá sé lárnach sa straitéis sin. Is é sin an príomhrud a bheidh an Stát in ann déanamh. Beimid in ann níos mó acmhainní a chur isteach agus níos mó a dhéanamh leis na múinteoirí chun go mbeidh caighdeán níos fearr acu as seo amach. Cheap mé go raibh smaointe maith ag Seanadóir Ó Ríordáin faoin gcaighdeán Gaeilge atá ar fáil sna scoileanna atá faoi mhíbhuntáiste, scoileanna DEIS. Tá siad ag déanamh jab maith ó thaobh na ranganna Gaeilge ansin ina cheantar féin. Tá an-obair déanta le mo Roinn i gcomhar leis na coláistí oiliúna ar mhaithe le mic léinn a thabhairt go dtí an Ghaeltacht ar feadh tréimhse, coicís nó trí seachtaine le linn a gcúrsaí oiliúna. Táim dóchasach go mbeidh tionchar dearfach ag an scéim sin ar chaighdeán Gaeilge an chéad ghlúin eile de mhúinteoirí Gaeilge sna scoileanna. Maidir le ceist Sheanadóir Ó Donnghaile, tá a fhios agam go bhfuil Foras na Gaeilge ann. Tá €750,000 faighte againn dóibh i mbliana. Tá príomhfheidhmeannach nua ansin, Seán Ó Coinn, agus cathaoirleach nua ar an mbord, Pól Ó Gallchóir, agus sílim go bhfuil an bheirt acu ag tosnú amach ag an am céanna agus ag brú ar aghaidh. Tá a fhios agam go raibh siad sásta leis an breis airgid ach arís go mbeidh níos mó ag teastáil agus go mbeidh siad ag iarraidh níos mó. Tá ról lárnach ag an bhForas Teanga ar bunaíodh in 1999. Bhí mé ag cruinniú den Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas ó Thuaidh agus chas mé leis an Aire Hazzard agus leis an Aire Givan a bhfuil ról lárnach aige i gcúrsaí Gaeilge.

#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-02 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	156	Maidir le comhoibriú ó Thuaidh, tá an Rialtas seo tiománta don chur chuige tras-Teorann a chur i bhfeidhm. Mar is eol don Sheanadóir, déileálann Foras na Gaeilge agus a chuid comheagraíochtaí leis an bpobal Gaeilge, a fhaigheann tacaíocht uathu le roinnt blianta anuas. Tá mise den tuairim go bhfuil siad uile sásta anois le hallúntas breise de €750,000. Dúirt an Seanadóir Reilly go bhfuil an straitéis fíorthábhachtach agus gur chaithfimid chuile rud a dhéanamh chun é a chur i bhfeidhm. Labhair an Seanadóir Byrne faoin gcaighdeán Gaeilge, faoi na múinteoirí agus rudaí mar sin freisin. Tá siad sin lárnach sa pholasaí oideachais atá foilsithe ag an Rialtas. Caithfimid é a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh di freisin. Ag deireadh an lae, ní mór aitheantas a thabhairt don mhéid atá bainte amach cheana féin ag na Ranna, ag na heagrais Stáit agus ag an earnáil dheonach, i gcúinsí fíor-dhúshlánacha, faoin naoi réimse den straitéis 20 bliain, agus ba mhaith liom iad seo a chur ar an taifead. In earnáil an oideachas - an polasaí d'oideachas Gaeltachta a chur i bhfeidhm, gníomhaíochtaí Gaeloideachais in earnáil na Gaelscolaíochta, straitéis náisiúnta litearthachta agus uimhearthachta a chur i bhfeidhm, tacaíochtaí d'earnáil na réamhscolaíochta ó mo Roinn agus ón Údarás, an córas Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge, TEG, cothaithe ag Ollscoil Mhaigh Nuad le maoiniú na Roinne, an tionscnamh ardscileanna Gaeilge á mhaoiniú ag mo Roinn go dtí 2021, dioplóma i múineadh na Gaeilge do dhaoine fásta á sholáthar ag Ollscoil Mhaigh Nuad, scéim na gcúntóirí teanga a riaradh ag mo Roinn, obair an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta, COGG, chun téacsleabhair agus tacaíocht don Ghaeloideachas a sheachadadh agus teagasc na Gaeilge i thart ar 40 ollscoil idirnáisiúnta maoinithe ag mo Roinn. I dtaobh reachtaíochta agus stádais - Acht na Gaeltachta 2012 a chur i bhfeidhm agus deireadh a chur leis an maolú don Ghaeilge san Aontas Eorpach i 2021. Sa Ghaeltacht - próiseas na pleanála teanga, an comhrá is mó sa Ghaeltacht maidir leis an Ghaeilge ó aimsir fheachtas na gcearta sibhialta faoi lán seoil, scéimeanna pobail na Roinne agus na scéimeanna atá ag an údarás chun fostaíochta a chruthú do mhuintir na Gaeltachta á gcur i bhfeidhm. I réimse an teaghlaigh agus na luath-idirghabhála - clár tacaíochta teaghlaigh mo Roinne dírithe ar dhaoine atá ag súil le páistí nua agus a bhfuil gasúir óga acu cheana féin, ionad tacaíochta teaghlaigh ag gníomhú i gCois Fharraige agus i gCorca Dhuibhne, Comhar Naíonraí na Gaeltachta agus Tuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta ag feidhmiú le tacaíocht ón Stát, agus scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge ag tacú le daoine atá ag tógáil a gcuid páistí le Gaeilge. Mar a bhaineann sé le riarachán, seirbhisí agus pobal - clár cuimsitheach oiliúna Gaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm san earnáil phoiblí, Ionad Gaeilge Thamhlachta a fhorbairt le tacaíocht mo Roinne, tacaíocht mo Roinne, an Údaráis agus an Fhorais don earnáil dheonach. Faoin teanga bheo - páirt lárnach ag an teanga in imeachtaí an chomórtha ar 1916, Féile Oireachtas na Samhna, Féile Sheachtain na Gaeilge ag tabhairt na teanga do phobal níos leithne faoi stiúir Chonradh na Gaeilge, agus Glór na nGael, Cumann na bhFiann agus Gael Linn ag tacú le pobail Gaeilge ar fud na tíre. Na meáin agus an teicneolaíocht - plean Gaeilge agus gníomh digiteach RTE á gcur i bhfeidhm, plean digiteach don Ghaeilge a fhorbairt, aip Raidió Ghaeilge RTE forbartha, seirbhísí d’ardchaighdeán á dtabhairt ag Raidió na Gaeltachta, TG4, Raidió na Life, Raidió Rí-Rá agus Raidió Fáilte, tuairisc.ie ag feidhmiú le tacaíocht ó Fhoras na Gaeilge, abair.ie á fhorbairt ag Coláiste na Tríonóide, agus córas aistriúcháin uathoibríoch don Ghaeilge forbartha. Ó thaobh foclóirí - an tAcht um Thithe an Oireachtais (Leasú) 2011 i bhfeidhm, gníomh a chuir an caighdeán oifigiúil faoi chúram Thithe an Oireachtais agus dhá athbhreithniú déanta air ó shin, an foclóir ar líne foclóir.ie forbartha ag Foras na Gaeilge, LEX, togra a ghineann téarmaíocht don Aontas Eorpach, faoi lán seoil, téarma.ie ar fáil ar líne agus foclóir stairiúil na Gaeilge á fhorbairt ag Acadamh Ríoga na hÉireann. Ó thaobh an tsaol eacnamaíochta - Údarás na Gaeltachta ag cruthú 500 post in aghaidh na bliana agus Foras na Gaeilge, Gael-Taca i gCorcaigh, Gaillimh le Gaeilge agus Gnó Mhaigh Eo ag cur an Ghaeilge chun cinn san earnáil ghnó. Ó thaobh na tionscnaimh leathana - suíomh tairsí na Gaeilge, PEIG, faoi lán seoil agus bailiúchán na scoil de chuid Chnuasach Béaloideas Éireann ar fáil ar líne mar chuid den chomóradh ar Eirí Amach na Cásca 1916.Is cúis bhróid don Rialtas é go bhfuil an méid seo bainte amach agus á bhaint amach faoin straitéis 20 bhliain faoi na cúinsí ina raibh muid ag feidhmiú le seacht mbliana anuas. Is mian liom a threisiú nach straitéis seacht mbliana ach straitéis 20 bliain atá i gceist. Beidh mise agus an fhoireann atá taobh thiar dom sa Roinn, le tacaíocht go príomha ón Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Foras na Gaeilge agus ceanneagraíochtaí an fhorais, ag cur ár gcuid fuinnimh isteach sa tasc atá romhainn leanúint leis an obair thábhachtach sna blianta atá amach romhainn. Ba mhaith liom arís mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le chuile dhuine as ucht páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht seo. Bhí mé sásta teacht isteach agus beidh mé sásta teacht isteach arís chun na hábhair seo a phlé. Gabhaim buíochas arís le chuile dhuine atá i láthair. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil formhór na ndaoine sa Teach seo, sa Dáil agus trasna na tíre i bhfabhar ár dteanga náisiúnta. Tá chuile dhuine ag iarraidh breis acmhainní a fháil don teanga agus dóibh siúd a labhraíonn í. Tá a fhios ag go leor daoine go bhfuil fadhbanna ann ó thaobh ár dteanga a mhúineadh. Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Hopkins, tagann daoine amach ón scoil tar éis blianta a chaitheamh ag foghlaim na Gaeilge gan a bheith in ann nó sásta an teanga a úsáid. B'fhéidir go mbíonn faitíos orthu an Ghaeilge a labhairt. Is é an ról atá agam ná breis acmhainní a fháil chun rudaí a dhéanamh níos éasca. Tá sé de dhualgas orm freisin oibriú leis an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna agus na hAirí eile chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá mé an-bhuíoch don Seanad as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom teacht os comhair an Tí.
