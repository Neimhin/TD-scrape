The reason our judicial appointments process needs to be reformed is to ensure that people are appointed to judicial office based solely on merit. For that reason, Fianna Fáil proposed legislation establishing a judicial appointments commission that is fully independent of Government and that would make recommendations to Government based on an independent assessment of the merits of applicants for judicial office. Unfortunately, the commission proposed by the Government will not allow for such an independent process of assessment. Among its faults is that the Bill will require the Chief Justice to sit on a commission that he or she will not chair. For instance, if a Taoiseach were to sit on a committee but not be its chairman, this would be dismissed out of hand by Government. The Bill also excludes the presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court from full membership of the commission. The Bill also proposes that the majority of the commission should be lay members, namely, persons who are neither judges nor lawyers. This grouping of judges and lawyers in the same category by the Government ignores the fact that judges are not members of the legal profession. The fact that they were previously members is not a basis to assume that judges and lawyers, if in a majority, will have a negative influence on this commission. It would be considered remarkable if surgeons in hospitals were selected by a panel the majority of whose members had never carried out surgery or even worked in a hospital. The Bill also proposes that the three persons recommended by the commission will not be ranked in order of merit. The failure to do so defeats the entire purpose of having a commission that seeks to recommend the best candidate. It is regrettable that the proposals put forward by the Government are not for the purpose of achieving genuine reform but instead are for the purpose of appeasing one member of Government whose proposals in this area are ill-considered and deeply flawed. Fianna Fáil remains committed to achieving reform in this area as outlined in our own Judicial Appointments Commission Bill published in October 2016. At present, when a vacancy arises in a court, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board places an advertisement in a newspaper or online inviting applications for appointment as a judge to the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. The board will then receive a series of applications from lawyers because only lawyers can apply to be judges. The job of the board is to process those applications. In many instances, particularly in respect of the District Court, hundreds of applications will have to be processed. The job of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is to determine who is suitable for the position. It is not the function of the board to try to identify the best candidate. It is a filtering process in the determination of suitable candidates. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is required under legislation to provide the Government with the names of seven individuals which it believes are suitable for appointment to a particular vacancy. Sometimes more than seven names are provided. If there are multiple vacancies, there will be many names put forward by the board to the Government. When the Government receives the list of names, it then makes its decision as to who should be selected. Under the Constitution, and also under the Government’s proposed scheme and the Fianna Fáil Bill, the Government can choose whoever it wants. It does not have to select a name from those provided. We believe it is appropriate that the recommending body should carry greater authority and that it should filter down its nominees such that the Government is aware of who it believes are the best persons for the position. The second issue is why the system needs to be changed or, in other words, what is the weakness in the system. The weakness in the system is that when a large list of names is presented to Cabinet most of the members of Cabinet, in fairness to them, do not know how to go about choosing one person from a list of 24 for a District Court position. There is no reason that politicians should be aware of who is the most suitable or best candidate. The State papers from 30 years ago published over the new year included a record of Alan Dukes, when Minister for Justice, stating that he did not know who was the best candidate or who should be selected to be a judge. He said that he felt it was a matter primarily for the Attorney General. In fairness to members of Cabinet, most of them do not know who are the most suitable candidates. It is unfair to put that pressure on the Government. It is true that people who have political connections are at an advantage if their names are on the list which goes to Cabinet. It is often said that canvassing should be prohibited. Many people who are appointed because of political connections turn out to be excellent judges, and we should not have a system where a person is excluded from subsequent nomination to judicial office because he or she was involved in politics. What we do not know is if there are good people who applied to be judges and who, as they did not know anybody in Cabinet or any Deputy, were overlooked and never got the opportunity of being promoted to the position of judge. For all of these reasons, the system needs to be changed. We need a recommending body that can identify who it believes will be the best person for the position of judge. We should have a recommending body that ranks individuals in terms of their suitability for the job. Under the Constitution, the Government has the final say. This is appropriate. Regardless of what system is in place or how it operates, the Government can disregard the list of candidates provided and appoint a candidate of its choosing. That is the scheme that currently operates under the Constitution. However, it needs to be changed and broadened to ensure that it is fairer and that the best people - they may be people whom we do not know and who do not have connections - have an opportunity to be considered and appointed. The Fianna Fáil Bill establishes a judicial appointments commission to recommend to the Government the names of individuals which it believes would be the most suitable based on merit to be judges. For each position, it will recommend three people. The Government's scheme has the same provision. Under our Bill, however, the three will be ranked 1, 2 and 3. In no way does this offend the constitutional prerogative that rests with the Cabinet. Under neither scheme must the Cabinet opt for anyone on the list. However, there is a benefit in the Cabinet being told by an expert body who it believes are the best people in a certain order.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	4	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017. First, I want to address the level of priority, and the amount of Dáil time last week and this week, being given to the Bill. Others may criticise us for wanting to speak on the Bill but that is our right. The Government has prioritised the Bill in Government time. It comes at the expense of legislation in a host of other areas which have greater priority, for example, a report was published earlier this year on motor insurance. At least six different Bills will be required to give effect to those recommendations. Where are they? We have not seen them. Why would the Government not prioritise an issue such as that before the summer recess so that progress can be made on issues that really matter to people's day to day life? The Government's legislative programme commits it to introducing a Bill to establish a mortgage arrears court. Last year during the negotiations between the Independents and Fine Gael mortgage arrears experts were in and out of Government Buildings, spokespersons were out talking about what the Government was going to do to help people in mortgage arrears. It was going to do the devil and all. We have seen absolutely nothing. Where is the legislation to help families protect their homes and deal with mortgage arrears? I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, on his reappointment. I know he is personally committed to dealing with gambling control. I have raised it with him before and I know he is considering various options. We have been kicking that issue around for a long time yet no legislation has been brought to the floor of the House. I do not know if the Minister of State is competing with other Ministers for Dáil time or is it a case that the legislation is not ready yet? We know this problem destroys lives and warrants the priority of this House but it is not getting attention. A final example is the vulture funds. We hear time and again Government spokespersons talking about the need to protect families and small and medium enterprises, SMEs, from vulture funds yet there has been no legislation whatsoever. The Government's efforts to deal with them were half-baked. It introduced the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing) Act 2015 which requires the intermediary to be regulated but not the owner of the loan. No priority is being given to that. I can only conclude that a great deal of time is being afforded to this legislation because it is a personal vanity project for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. Unfortunately, Fine Gael is playing ball with him. Perhaps that is the price of power. That is the only conclusion I can reach on this issue. We know it has been a personal crusade of the Minister, Deputy Ross, for several decades. I do not think the system is as fundamentally broken as it is often said to be. Reforms are undoubtedly required. I support the legislation introduced last year by our justice spokesperson, Deputy O'Callaghan, which would result in more meaningful reforms in the area of judicial appointments. While it runs counter to many of the Minister, Deputy Ross's public utterances, the Judiciary has served this country well and in the overwhelming majority of cases the appointments to the Bench by successive Governments have resulted in high calibre judges being appointed and they have by and large performed their duties with distinction. That should be said lest the impression be given that our justice system is so broken that it is utterly dysfunctional as a result of the quality of the judges appointed hitherto. One issue which has dominated the debate on this legislation is what the Government characterises as the lay or non-lay majority. We would say the question is whether to have a judicial or non-judicial majority and Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill provides that neither judicial nor non-judicial members of the commission would be in the majority. The Government conflates the legal membership of the commission with judges to say that we seek a judge-based majority. That is not what is set out in the Bill and it is an important distinction.  The commission should rank the candidates. We respect the supremacy of the provision in the Constitution that it will remain a matter of course for the Government of the day to recommend the appointment of certain persons to the Bench and the President gives effect to that by making the formal appointment. We believe there should be an onus on the Government to consider recommendations from the commission in the form of a list of candidates in a certain order, based on the criteria set out in our legislation. If the Government seeks to deviate from that, or to appoint somebody, which is its right, who has not been put forward by the new judicial appointments commission it would have to give a reasoned opinion to back up that position. That is an important reform because it introduces a level of accountability and transparency that is not in the system. We ask the Government to consider that reform if the Bill passes Second Stage and makes its way to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality. We hope the Government will genuinely consider the amendments tabled by Deputy O'Callaghan on behalf of Fianna Fáil on that issue.  The people who know best whether somebody is qualified and has the appropriate skills to serve as a judge are judges themselves and others who have the relevant experience. Under our Bill there would be 12 members of the commission, including the Chief Justice, who is President of the Supreme Court, the Presidents of the Court of Appeal, the High Court, Circuit and District Courts. They are what we would regard as judicial members. There would be seven non-judicial members so it is not the case, contrary to what people have been seeking to portray, that we wanted a majority of the commission to be comprised of judges. That point has been lost during this debate. Of the seven non-judicial members there would be representatives of the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society, the Citizens Information Board, which has direct contact with citizens, Údarás um Ard-Oideachas, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC. Such a composition would strike the correct balance and result in the best possible recommendations being made.  We have also set out the criteria that would need to be met. Anyone considered appropriate for appointment to the Bench needs integrity, independence of mind, moral courage, a high level of intellectual skill, sound temperament, common sense, impartiality, objectivity, fairness, equanimity and composure. We also believe that persons recommended by the commission to Government for appointment should be interviewed by members of the commission and this is a reform we will bring forward on Committee Stage.  The Government can disregard whatever legislative based system is put in place because of the supremacy of the provision in the Constitution that it is ultimately the prerogative of the Government to recommend to the President the appointment of certain persons to the Bench. Through legislative reform, we need to put in place the best safeguards possible. The package of measures we have brought forward strikes a better balance than the proposals set out in the Government's Bill. They do so by providing for the appropriate expertise on the commission, ensuring that the individuals who are going to be recommended to the Government be ranked, and providing that specific criteria be used by the commission in considering the suitability of individual candidates for appointment to the Bench. Those provisions are laid out in our legislation. Candidates would need to be interviewed and, should the Government decide not to proceed with the recommendation of the commission, it would need to provide a reasoned opinion in respect of that decision. There is a need to comment on the reactions of and submissions made by those currently serving on the Bench. They should not be dismissed. They are the people who, day in, day out, ensure that our justice system functions and serves the needs of our citizens. When the Association of Judges in Ireland suggests that the proposals put forward by the Government are seriously flawed, we need to take it seriously. I agree that the rationale for a lay majority and a lay chairperson has not been explained. I have not seen any overarching rationale set out by the Government for such a provision. The judges also expressed a concern, which we share, that no member of the District Court or Circuit Court is to be a member of the commission. Those courts together deal with the overwhelming majority of cases although, of course, the vast majority of citizens would hope to go through their entire lives and never have interaction with the courts. The Government, however, has seen fit to propose a membership structure for a judicial appointments commission that gives no expression to that and no recognition to the expertise of existing members of the Judiciary who are serving in those courts. That is a major omission from the Government's legislation which needs to be rectified. The Chief Justice, Ms Justice Susan Denham as well as the presidents of the Court of Appeal, High Court, Circuit Court and the District Court have sent correspondence to the Taoiseach expressing their concern at the legislation proposed by the Government. They are quoted as having stated that the proposals, in their view, would have serious implications for the administration of justice. The Government seems quite prepared to brush all that aside. I have not seen any proper account taken of those remarks in any comments made by the Minister, Deputy Ross or by anyone serving in the current Government. The points made by Elaine Byrne in the Sunday Business Post last weekend also need to be brought to the floor of the House. She drew attention to the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption, GRECO's fourth evaluation round report on Ireland, "Corruption prevention in respect of members of parliament, judges and prosecutors". This is a compliance report in respect of Ireland published in November 2014. In the last week or so, the council published an update on this report. The update sets out a series of recommendations which would improve the governance environment for members of parliament, judges and prosecutors. The most recent report, which assesses the 11 recommendations made in 2014, finds in essence that three recommendations have been dealt with by the Government. A number of the recommendations relate specifically to the Judiciary. Although the Government has given absolute priority to legislation governing how judges are appointed, this has been at the expense of critically important issues highlighted in this report. For example, the issue of the judicial council is one which Deputy O'Callaghan has raised in this House a number of times with the Minister. GRECO recommended that, with due expedition, an independent statutory council be established for the Judiciary and that it be provided with adequate resources and funding for its organisation and operations. GRECO concludes that this recommendation has not been implemented. The Government provided the update that the Bill was being worked on and was on the way. Back in 2014, GRECO recommended that a system for the selection, recruitment, promotion and transfers of judges be introduced. The Government's response is this Bill. It is interesting to note, however, that in GRECO's comment on the Bill, it says that the council encourages the authorities to pursue their reform efforts in close consultation with the Judiciary to the extent feasible and looks forward to being further informed on the results of these efforts. Given that the Judiciary has had to break ranks and speak out publicly through a press release and correspondence with the Taoiseach, I do not see how one could conclude that the Government has brought forward these reforms following close consultation with it. If such consultation has in fact taken place, its outcome has been a Government decision to completely disregard the views of the Judiciary in respect of the composition of the commission in particular. GRECO also recommended that an appropriate structure be established, within the framework of which questions concerning constitutional safeguards of the Judiciary in connection with employment conditions are to be examined, again in close dialogue with judicial representatives, with a view to maintaining the high levels of judicial integrity and professional quality in the future. I acknowledge that is not an easy matter to deal with. GRECO has, however, stated that there has not been any implementation of this recommendation by the Government. GRECO further recommended, very importantly, that a code of conduct for judges be formally established, including guidance and confidential counselling in respect of conflicts of interest and other integrity-related matters, gifts, recusal, third party contacts, the handling of confidential information, etc., and that such an instrument be connected to an accountability mechanism. Again, GRECO has concluded that this 2014 recommendation has not been implemented by the Government. It further recommended that dedicated induction and in-service training for judges be institutionalised and adequately resourced while respecting the independence of the Judiciary. Again, GRECO concludes that this recommendation has not been implemented. In the context of this Bill, the recommendations set out by the 2014 GRECO report have not been addressed by the Government. The provisions that are advancing just happen to be the subject matter of some attention by the Minister, Deputy Ross over the course of his political life and indeed in the course of his work as a Minister.  We will never know the truth as to whether any deal was done between the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar and the Minister, Deputy Ross on the Sunday evening two weeks ago when it became known that the Government was seeking to press ahead the following morning with the formal appointment of Ms Justice Máire Whelan by the President. It does stretch the bounds of credibility and goes beyond my capacity to believe that all of this happens to be a coincidence. The Government is attaching enormous priority in its legislative programme to the passage of this Bill against that backdrop. I welcome the fact that the Bill is not going to become law before the summer recess. The summer recess provides a window of opportunity for the Government side to reflect on what has been a very productive and informative debate. We have to reflect on the core objective. Ultimately, the citizens want a justice system that serves them well. They want to ensure that the judges sitting on the Bench have integrity and are genuinely independent and competent, and that they have the appropriate skills, expertise and qualifications to perform their function to the highest standards. It is our considered view within Fianna Fáil that the proposals we have put forward, were they to be adopted by the Government and used as a means to amend the Bill, would represent significant progress in the manner in which judges are appointed.We will engage in detail throughout the full distance of the legislative process for this Bill, and we hope that those reforms that we are proposing will be taken on board by Government.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	5	I welcome some friends from Ballyroan Men's Shed in Rathfarnham who are in the Public Gallery. I want to let them know that because I have welcomed them, their presence is etched on the Dáil record for years to come, and I hope they enjoy their visit to the national Parliament. I want to join my colleagues in making some preliminary general points before moving on to detail. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill. We know, as my colleague Deputy O'Callaghan said at the instigation of this debate last week, that the job of being a judge requires significant expertise and knowledge of various aspects of the law, including common law, statute law and the general legal system. It is the function of judges to apply that law. In Ireland we can agree that our Judiciary, by and large, has stood the test of time, and we can stand by our judicial system. It is true too that there have been very occasional horrific miscarriages of justice that have had to be remedied by the political system, and the political system has shown the flexibility to do that over time as well. Previous speakers have at this stage well rehearsed what we on this side of the House see as the flaws contained in the Bill, and also the speed with which the Government has attempted to get it through the Dáil. The priorities of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport are curious. Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned the Rugby World Cup 2023 Bill 2017 and other priorities in legislation that have been overlooked by the Government in its attempts to pass this Bill before the recess. The Rugby World Cup 2023 Bill 2017, which is a true priority of some urgency for this Government, for the country and for the Parliament, was relegated to second place behind this Judicial Appointments Bill in the last few weeks. It says much about the priorities of Deputy Ross as Minister with responsibility for sport and tourism and for the development of sport and tourism in the country that he chose to be so tardy with the World Cup legislation, which is a prerequisite for Ireland's bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023, and that he prioritised this non-urgent Judicial Appointments Bill in its place. We also know about Deputy Ross's form on the issue of the Judiciary, and indeed Deputy Michael McGrath adverted to it in his speech earlier. In a recent article in the Sunday Business Post journalist Elaine Byrne put it well when she said that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has always been obsessed about judges being politically appointed. She goes on to suggest that this is nothing new, and that, "Oireachtas records from the 1980s show that he went as far as sponsoring a Seanad motion seeking to introduce legislation to prevent a judge from even getting a pension". In my view, coming from the type of constituency that I represent, a diverse population, people from diverse backgrounds and communities and people from diverse economic and social backgrounds, I believe the Minister's and the Government's proposals have actually missed a golden opportunity. Far from the perception of judges belonging to a golden circle or indeed coming from an elite group in society, it is worth noting what we can from the details available. I agree with Deputy Ross that we ought to know more about our judges, including their professional, education and client backgrounds and whether conflicts of interest exist. In terms of the details that are available to us, a cursory glance at the details available publicly regarding the educational backgrounds of our Supreme and High Court Judiciary is interesting to note. The details of all of the judges are not available, but their school backgrounds are interesting, because it might run contrary to what the public generally thinks. Our existing Supreme and High Court judges come from a variety of educational backgrounds including Alexandra College, St Mary’s Christian Brothers School, Belfast, Presentation Brothers College, Cork, Drimnagh Castle CBS, Dublin, Terenure College, Blackrock College, and O’Connells CBS, Dublin. We know from Deputy Ross's website that he was educated at St. Stephen's School, Dundrum, Rugby School, Trinity College Dublin and the University of Geneva. That contrasts with some of the educational backgrounds of some of the judges. I look forward to the day when a judge in our Supreme Court or High Court or lower courts comes from my alma mater, Coláiste Éanna in Ballyroan, or St. MacDara’s Community College, or any community college, whether it is in Killinarden, Ballrothery, Old Bawn or Firhouse.  The Minister's Judicial Appointments Bill has no proposals that provide encouragement for those aspirants who come from disadvantaged backgrounds and who, regardless of how bright they are, could never hope to afford the cost of studying at the Bar or devilling for a year or two. The Bill misses the opportunity to promote the idea that, whatever your background or wherever you come from, or regardless of the school you attended, you could aspire to become a High Court or Supreme Court judge and while rigorously applying the law, also enrich the profession by bringing a rich tapestry of backgrounds to the Bench. The Bill does nothing to promote this idea or foster the idea of making the Bar and the legal profession, and thereby the Bench, more accessible to all strands and genders in society. Recently the Group of States Against Corruption, GRECO, reprimanded Ireland for not introducing in-service training for judges. The lack of a facility to give in-service training across a whole range of issues, including socio-economic background issues, to judges as they serve on the Bench is another missed opportunity in this Bill, as is the continued absence of an independent statutory council. GRECO also rapped Ireland on the knuckles, which was again commented on by the same journalist in the Sunday Business Post, for failing to establish a code of conduct for judges. Deputy John McGuinness referred to this in his contribution last week. Politicians, down to the level of county councillors, are subject to the standards in public office legislation, which governs the receipt of gifts, third party contacts and so on. This is a live issue. Turning to the Bill itself I note, as others have done, that the Bill proposes the retention of the Attorney General as both a member of the judicial appointments commission and as a member of the Cabinet that makes the final decision about the appointment of a judge. Colleagues have rightly pointed out that this is clearly a conflict of interest and runs counter to Deputy Ross’s stated objective of de-politicising the appointments process. The biggest flaw in the proposals is that, regardless of the names proposed by the newly proposed appointments commission, the Government may disregard the recommendations and decide simply to make their own appointments, as they can do currently. Fianna Fáil’s alternative would ensure that the successful nominees, as decided by the judicial appointments commission in our model, would be ranked in order of those best suited in the opinions of the judicial appointments commission. If the Government failed to apply the ranking system in the appointment of the judges it would be required to explain publicly its decision. There are consequences to this Bill passing. The process moves away from an interview-based process to an initial paper-based process, in the sense that candidates submit their curricula vitae to a committee that is going to be dominated by non-judicial appointees, many of whom will have no familiarity with the law. It is curious that there is a provision in the Bill for the appointment of consultants or advisors in the event that the commission is unable to make a decision. What the Minister is proposing is taking current expertise and replacing it with non-judicial or lay expertise. If the members of the new commission lack the expertise to make an appointment they can appoint consultants to assist them in making the appointment.In this regard section 14(7) states:The Commission may as it considers necessary to assist it in the performance of its functions or the functions of any of its committees—(a) enter into contracts or arrangements with any person, and(b) with the consent of the Minister, appoint consultants or advisers.Section 14(8) states:Any contract or arrangement with a person, or appointment of a consultant or adviser, referred to in subsection (7) may, for the purpose of a relevant committee performing the function referred to in section 11(2), enable the person, consultant or adviser to—(a) advise and assist the relevant committee in its consideration of applicants at a preliminary stage in the course of the selection procedures, and(b) provide an evaluation or an assessment of an applicant’s suitability for appointmentWe are replacing the simple appointment of judges who have the relevant skill and expertise with that of consultants, to fill the gap the lay members will not be in a position to fill. I could make other points but I am sharing with Deputy Brendan Smith and I defer to him.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	6	This Bill is all about internal Cabinet politics. It is about Fine Gael’s absolute and urgent need to placate the Minister, Deputy Ross, and to keep him sweet for the coming months. It is why we have been landed with this flawed and poorly constructed Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and it is why we are devoting, if not wasting, so much time on it. The bitter reality is this Bill will not even achieve the objectives that its few champions, including those in Sinn Féin, claim for it. It will have long-term negative consequences for the public. As my colleague Deputy Jim O'Callaghan said, "In the opinion of Fianna Fáil, this legislation will have significant detrimental consequences. First, it will damage the quality of the justice administered by our courts. Second, it will politicise the appointment of judges to an even greater extent than currently. Third, it will establish an unnecessary and costly quango that will over-complicate what should be a simple process of recommending the 20 or 30 people suitable for judicial appointment each year". That point will resonate with many outside this Chamber and is one that has not received sufficient focus in much of the public commentary and debate. The Fine Gael-led Government, and this is now a Government Bill, no matter how much some Deputies on the far side wish to deny it, plans to put in place a costly and elaborate commission, along with a judicial appointments commission office and a judicial appointments commission director. Gone are the heady days of 2011 when Fine Gael candidates, including the Taoiseach, were not only telling us that they were going to abolish quangos, they even drew up a list of 145 quangos that they were set to throw on a bonfire. As we know, the bonfire did not burn for too long with what Fine Gael actually threw on it, perhaps because the previous Fianna Fáil Government had already done the job via the bord snip nua report. Whatever the reason, we now have the party that once stood on the platform of reducing the number of agencies and commissions because they are so costly and bureaucratic coming into the Dáil to propose creating an even more complex and costly apparatus to replace something that did the job for a minimal cost.  Approximately 20 people a year are nominated to judicial office. The existing Judicial Appointments Advisory Board did what was required of it, simply and inexpensively. Its board members met informally in an office. The board had a secretary. They examined the applications and they supplied names to Government. What this legislation proposes is to replace an uncomplicated process with a mini-empire staffed by individuals who will spend a lot of public money on trying to identify people suitable for appointment. As my colleague, Deputy Jim O’Callaghan, has stated here in this debate, what the Government is proposing is an astonishing waste of money and it is wholly unnecessary. It is creating an enormous and unnecessary quango to recommend individuals based on curricula vitae submitted for about 20 jobs a year. Not only has Deputy O’Callaghan identified this problem with what the Government is proposing, he has identified and proposed a comprehensive alternative that is nowhere near as costly as the proposal before us today and which has the benefit of already having passed Second Stage. As Deputy O’Callaghan outlined in his Second Stage speech back in October 2016, the purpose of his Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2016 was to try to improve the process by which members of the Judiciary are nominated and appointed. All of us here can surely agree that the abiding principle underpinning the nomination and appointment of judges must be that all recommendations and appointments are based on merit alone. Their appointment should be based solely on the fact that the Government believes they will make excellent judges who will be able to administer justice fairly and impartially and not because of any possible party political or ideological allegiance. This is a crucial principle and it is one that we can say that governments of varying political hues have adhered to. This is not merely a matter of opinion, it is a demonstrable fact thanks to the work of three academics from the School of Law and Government in DCU. In their article, "The (not-so-surprising) non-partisanship of the Irish Supreme Court", they state: "Ireland is therefore a country in which we would expect partisan heritage to be reflected in judicial decisions. We analyse over 5,000 decisions of the Irish Supreme Court and despite rigorous testing we find no evidence of partisanship in decision-making". I could put this more succinctly, as Dr. O’Malley did in a tweet a few days ago, "Shane Ross TD thinks you can predict Supreme Court decisions on the basis of party affiliation. We tried. You can't". As Fianna Fáil outlined in our Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2016, there is a clear case to be made for both reforming the current system, which was established in 1995, and expanding upon it. Whereas the existing Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, simply gives advice to the Government on judicial appointments and gives the names of seven people to the Government for each judicial vacancy, it does not rank the individuals in terms of who it believes is the best and does not identify the best candidates for appointment. What Deputy O’Callaghan’s Bill did, and what this piece of legislation before us fails to do, is to put in place a clear and workable scheme where the Commission can identify the best candidates for appointment to the Judiciary and then recommend, and rank in order of preference, three persons for appointment to each vacant judicial post. It also allowed the Commission to make recommendations for nomination to the important positions of Chief Justice and presidents of the courts. What Fianna Fáil proposed in our 2016 Bill was constitutionally sound as the power to nominate judges remained solely with the Government. The Government alone would still make the decision, either to accept any one of the three names submitted to it or to pick none of the three, with the proviso that it publish a reasoned decision for not having done so on the Minister’s website. There is no such provision in the Government’s Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017. This Bill would allow the judicial appointment controversy that happened just three weeks ago to happen again. When Fianna Fáil’s 2016 Bill was debated here last October it received widespread praise and approval, including from Sinn Féin, but not for the first time in Sinn Féin, political expediency and point-scoring have trumped doing the right thing. The Government should have progressed the Fianna Fáil legislation but, as with so many other issues and crises sitting in the Government’s in-tray, it played petty partisan politics. It ignored the comprehensive reform package that was before it and had such widespread support and it did nothing. It did not just do nothing; it played petty old-school politics and scrambled around looking for whatever arcane or obscure pretence it could find to disregard what we had produced by declining to supply a money message. Consider the irony of that stroke for a moment. The Government decided to reject a Private Members’ Bill which would reform the system of appointing judges at a minimal cost, claiming that it involved a potential charge on the Exchequer, just so it could allow its own Bill, which will involve a considerably greater charge on the Exchequer, to advance. That money message stroke gives the game away. My colleague, Deputy James Lawless, drew attention during last week’s debate to the number of references to judicial independence, respect for the Chief Justice and respect for the State in John M. Kelly’s seminal legal work, The Irish Constitution. Deputy Lawless specifically highlighted John Kelly’s warning that any attempt to interfere with the system of judicial appointments would be unconstitutional and reminded us that the late John Kelly had previously represented the Dublin South constituency, now partially represented by the Minister, Deputy Ross. The skills and talents we require in our judges are considerable. We need judges who have a very good understanding of the law, but who also have integrity, independence, impartiality, objectivity, courtesy, composure and an ability to communicate, and we need lawyers to apply to become judges. Not every good lawyer will make a good judge, but one cannot be a good judge unless one is a good lawyer. To find those good lawyers and good judges we must have a system that can fairly, transparently and expertly identify the best candidates. That is not what the 2017 Government Bill offers us, but it is what the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2016 offered and we are showing remarkably poor judgment in not pursuing it.That is the legislative measure the Government should have been putting thorough the Oireachtas. When I travel through my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, what people talk to me about in relation to the Department of Justice and Equality is the need for additional Garda resources for divisions such as ours where Garda numbers have declined considerably during the years. I appeal to the Minister of State, as I did to the line Minister in the Department, to ensure additional resources are provided for areas such as Cavan and Monaghan where we have huge issues. People tell us we should give the Garda the resources it needs to deal with both urban and rural crime. The time being spent on this legislation in the Legislature is ridiculous.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	7	With no disrespect to the Minister of State, it is unfortunate that the line Minister responsible for justice issues has not taken the time to be here for the entirety of the debate. We are not talking about a simple amendment Bill with no major consequences and it behoves the Minister to take the time to be here to listen to all of the points being made. Before getting into any of its detail, I note that the Bill is indicative of the tail wagging the dog in government. I would love if the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, was here because I do not like to speak about him when he is not in the House. However, I had the opportunity to launch many a Scud missile at him in the Seanad for many years. For 30 years in the Seanad he was the supreme leader and teacher when it came to hurling on the ditch. Having made the transition to the Cabinet, it seems that the other 14 members have caved in and happily allowed hurling on the ditch to be the fulcrum on which legislative change and improvements are to be brought forward. When one considers the issues and problems facing the country, the haste with which this legislation is being brought forward following the appointment of the former Attorney General is not missed in any objective analysis. One cannot do a Stepaside Garda station on the Judiciary. One must consider the particular issue in the context of the closure of Garda stations in rural areas across the country and the increase in rural crime. In the Acting Chairman's constituency one often sees difficulties where Garda stations are closing and the incidence of rural crime has increased. As a rural and regionally based Deputy, it galls me to see Stepaside Garda station reopening at the demand of the supreme hurler when there are probably quite a number of Garda stations, prisons and everything else within a short distance of where the Minister lives. I had the opportunity around Christmas some years ago and before Deputy Shane Ross was a Minister to be driving in traffic. I came across him in the middle of the road at a set of traffic lights wearing a Santa hat and holding a banner calling for the reopening of Stepaside Garda station. It is great to see such initiative and colour as the foundations on which serious legislative change is considered by the Government as a whole. Given that Fine Gael in government in 1995 set up the current arrangement, it was unexpected that Santa Claus would be the man to pull it asunder and dig up the pitch. As I said last week in another debate, it is certainly understandable that at times politicians will play the man and the ball, but why we would seek to dig up the pitch is beyond me. That is what the Minister is doing with the support of Fine Gael and other members of the Cabinet. In the circumstances, it is no surprise the Minister for Justice and Equality is seeking to duck out of the debate at this time. I hope the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, will not be playing the tune to which the rest of the Cabinet will dance in other matters. We heard examples from Deputy John Lahart of the consistency of the Minister's relentless and unfounded attack on the Judiciary which goes way back to an attempt to prevent the provision of a pension for a judge in the 1980s. Like breaching the Official Secrets Act on the first day of his appointment as a Minister, he could do with some training and expertise. One wonders whether he would have made the grade had there been a lay body to appoint Ministers. Certainly, he has always been a colourful contributor in putting forward good suggestions. However, it was often the case that the ones which grabbed the biggest headlines were not founded on best practice internationally or what was recommended here. I turn to the issue of political lineage. Everyone, including the Judiciary, is in favour of reform of the appointments process for judges. We have our own proposals, into the detail of which many of my colleagues have gone and which would greatly improve matters. We gave them an airing in October 2016 and I am at a loss to know where they have been since. Certainly, the Government looked to stall or bury them. I am just guessing, but I imagine it did not envisage the antics of the Minister in bringing forward a Bill such as this to lacerate Fine Gael's own good proposals of 1995, albeit they needed reform. Everybody is looking for reform, including the Judiciary. I have often heard theories from the Minister and others about political lineage. This is a very small country of 5 million people. If we were to randomly pick 20 people on Grafton Street, we could trace a political lineage to each one, even if he or she was a floating voter from one election to another. Being from a small country, there is every likelihood he or she had a first cousin who was a councillor, a brother who canvassed for someone, or a mother or a father who was affiliated to a particular person purely on personal grounds who happened to go on to be a Minister. These grounds alone do not exclude people. I used to live in the midlands, although I will not say where because I do not want to identify any of the people involved. I am reminded of a gentleman who regularly found himself on the wrong side of the law on foot of a substance and alcohol addiction. He never really had the means to secure legal aid, but some of the charitably minded local solicitors would see to his needs as he was brought before whichever court. One particular solicitor who used to look after him and do his best on his behalf became a judge after a number of years. While he did not sit anywhere near the midlands, he was back there as a visiting judge on one occasion. As he was mounting the steps of the courthouse, the particular gentleman was once again in trouble and approached him saying, "You have to help me today, I am in bad shape. I really need your assistance." The judge told him that he was very sorry but he could not speak to him because he was now the judge. "Better again" was the man's response. Those stories are good and entertaining but in practice it does not happen. There is not a single example, whether the judge was appointed by Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil or anybody else in government - perhaps the Minister, Deputy Ross, once he gets stuck into his new process of appointments - where a decision by a particular court can be associated with a level of political expediency. It is wrong. We all want to push towards a reform agenda to make it a little better but to do it in this way is absolutely wrong. It is to follow a very populist agenda for what is to my mind, with regard to the examples I have given, a somewhat manufactured reason and manufactured view that if somebody happens to be linked to political support of some kind or other, he or she will sway the judgment in favour of a particular perspective. I do not believe that is the case. I am conscious of making the point about the separation of powers. I am concerned with broader reform. At times in the interpretation of the law there are parameters within which there is no wrong or right decision by a court. They are still legal decisions. At times, courts can focus a little too much on the practice. It is something we can be critical of in the House in terms of the practice rather than the legislation. Interpretation of the law, in particular in civil law, family law and issues such as that, tends to follow the practice and what went on in previous cases, which may not always be the correct outcome. There is drift when that happens because there is a reliance not on the literal interpretation of the law but on the practice and outcome of other cases. As a lay person, perhaps I am completely wrong on this point and perhaps I prove we should not have a lay person picking judges. It might be something that could be looked at on another day in terms of considering law reform in general. The idea of having lay people involved in picking judges is an honourable one. There could be lay representation but to have a lay chair and a lay majority on this group would be crazy in the extreme. It makes it wide open to manipulation by particular interest groups that could take a long-term view and try to infiltrate the membership of these organisations. The example may have been given of pro-choice or pro-life groups using it to see if a particular applicant will take a harder view on custodial sentences versus non-custodial sentence and things like that. I am certain it is not the correct way to go. Over the course of the debate, colleagues from all sides have given a wide variety of examples. An example is surgeons being chosen by lay people who do not have medical expertise or lay people choosing people for senior accountancy positions in the Central Bank or for positions in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. There are a variety of things that can be done to give the people a better sense of ownership of the process but a lay majority is not the way to go.  In terms of the establishment of a quango, I am not sure this is the correct way. Part 5, section 32 provides that "[t]here shall be attached to the Commission an office to be known as the Judicial Appointments Commission Office...which shall assist the Commission in the performance of its functions" and that "[t]he Office shall be funded by moneys provided by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform." How much is that? Later during Leaders' Questions, I hope to raise an issue of children suffering from arthritis getting appointments in hospitals. This month, they are getting letters saying the hospital hopes to facilitate an appointment in March 2018. The reason is the hospitals do not have the resources. When we go to the Minister on such an issue under the Health Act 2004, the Minister kicks it back to the HSE, which then kicks it back to us by saying there are competing priorities. Yet we are rushing in here on the back of the hurler on the ditch to set up another quango. How much money will be required for this from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform? The Bill provides that "[t]he terms and conditions of service of a member of staff of the Office shall be determined by the Commission with the consent of the Minister". What are the terms and conditions? How much money will it cost? It further provides that "[a] member of staff of the Office shall be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State." Is that people transferring internally? Will people be appointed from elsewhere? Section 33 provides that "[t]he Commission shall, following a selection process held by the Public Appointments Service, appoint a person to be the director (in this Act referred to as the “Director”) of the Office." How will that be done? What qualifications will that person need? It states the person will have the job for five years from the date of his or her appointment and that a director whose term of office expires shall be eligible for reappointment. It provides that "[a] person who is reappointed by the Commission in accordance with subsection (3) shall not hold office for periods the aggregate of which exceeds 10 years." That is fair enough. What costs will be involved in this? Have we looked at that? It is galling when we see the difficulties we have in health and many other issues when we are rushing to set up something else. I thank the Minister of State for being here. The criticism is not of him but of his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ross, who certainly should have been here.

His voice was colourful, sometimes informative and sometimes of benefit but now that it has an impact on the legal establishment of the State and how it operates, we have to consider caution rather than political expediency when we decide what to do with it. Our proposals, which have been before the Minister since October 2016, have presumably been thrown into the room where such proposals are stored when put forward by the Opposition. They should be dug out and looked at in detail before Committee Stage. Deputy Michael McGrath said that hopefully the summer recess will bring some common sense and senior Fine Gael Ministers might consult some legal friends in their constituencies before Committee Stage in the new term. I hope the amendments being tabled by Deputy O'Callaghan, in line with our Bill, will be taken on board. What we are about to do here is not play the ball or play the man but dig up the pitch.That is wrong and it has huge implications for law enforcement in our State and for the Judiciary.

None of the Members who believe this is important, urgent legislation is here. This is not a criticism of the Minister of State but the new Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, should be here to listen to these contributions. I actually think the reason he is not here is because he does not believe in the legislation and because his predecessor was browbeaten into this at Cabinet by the Minister, Deputy Ross, who I will get to in a minute. The Minister, Deputy Ross, should just concentrate on trying to get something done in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and not stick his oar into the area of justice, because he has proved over the last few months how little he actually knows on the topic. It is telling, however, that the Minister of State is the only member of Fine Gael here. We have no member of Cabinet here and no one from Sinn Féin either. When I looked at the legislation, I also looked at who was supporting it. We are talking here about changing the judicial system and the structures that have served this State very well since Independence. Will anyone here tell me there has been an issue with the probity of our judicial system? Has there been an issue with the independence of our judicial system? Is there, or has there ever been, an issue with the standard and quality of the people appointed? I do not think so. I think that we should be very proud of how the Judiciary has functioned through very difficult times since Independence. These included some particularly difficult times through the foundation of this State, through the Second World War and through the terrorist campaign perpetrated in this country by many of the Members who could not have been bothered to be here today from the provisional Sinn Féin movement. Many of these people, having tried to-----

The reality is that only a few short years ago many members of Sinn Féin did not even recognise the Irish courts, judicial system or, indeed, the Irish State. These are the people this Government is now hoping will support this flawed legislation.

That will happen because of the deal that the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Fine Gael Government have done with Sinn Féin, whose members are absent today, for the support of this Bill. This is a worry to me because I actually value our Judiciary and the independence of our courts. This is really serious. Let us go back to the trial of the late Seán Mac Stíofáin in the early 1970s. This was the last terrorist trial by jury in Ireland, after which non-jury trials were introduced. The whole jury at that trial was got to, in some cases by people sitting in this House.

I do not mean to make the Acting Ceann Comhairle's job more difficult. I will simply say that over the 40-year course of the armed conflict, if we want to call it that, there were people in this country who tried on a regular basis to circumvent and undermine the judicial system and to undermine juries. Many of them did not even recognise the courts. This is all factual. There are very few people who could disagree with that. We know that many of the people in question happened to come from one political party. That party is now supporting this legislation from Fine Gael and the Minister, Deputy Ross. I think this legislation is deeply flawed. I earnestly believe that our Judiciary and our courts have served us very well. We do not need to take a wrecking-ball to the legal and judicial structures of the State that have served us so well since Independence. I would like to know where the Minister, Deputy Ross's vendetta and crusade come from. What is the reason for this? Who has advised the Minister, Deputy Ross, on this? Who is talking in his ear and telling him that our court system needs to be turned upside-down? I do not believe he made this up himself. My party and I agree certain changes and reforms are required. Downgrading the position of the Chief Justice to that of a member of an advisory committee, however, is akin to asking the Taoiseach to serve on an Oireachtas or Government committee but not chair it. What is that about? Do we not trust the Judiciary? I do. What this legislation tells me, however, is that this Government and Cabinet do not trust the Irish judicial system. This is the fundamental issue I have with this. Why support this flawed legislation if that were not the case? I would like it if the Minister for Justice and Equality were here to respond and to list for me the Government's concerns with judicial appointments in the past. Let him list the judges with whom the Government has a problem. We will then be told that the separation of powers applies. I agree fully with the separation of powers. It is my view and that of my party's, however, that this legislation undermines the separation of powers between the Oireachtas and the Judiciary. This is because of the debate that has taken place over the last few weeks, both publicly and here the House and led by its cheerleader-in-chief, the Minister, Deputy Ross. I would like the Minister, Deputy Ross, to concentrate on the job he is supposed to do in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. He was, the last time I checked, the Minister in that Department.It is hard to figure that out. I know the Minister, Deputy Ross, very well and I mean no disrespect to him but I have looked at the performance and output of his Department in the more than a year he has held that position and basically all he has done in that time is produce a new timetable for Dublin Bus. It is gas. I am a commuter. I come from the commuter constituency of Dublin Fingal where people are trying to get in and out of Dublin city every day in an over-packed DART and underfunded rail system. The Minister, Deputy Ross, does absolutely nothing about it. He has called for a second capital review. This follows the review of the previous Minister, Deputy Donohoe. The best thing to do in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport when one does not wish to do anything is seek a capital review. The previous Minister, Deputy Donohoe, did it and when Deputy Ross took over he decided to have another review as well. The Minister, Deputy Ross, should be concentrating on projects such as metro north, the DART underground and the future expansion and development of Dublin Airport. I met with the Minister regarding the new runway developments at Dublin Airport and I thanked him for meeting with a group of residents a number of months ago on this issue. However, the Minister has a statutory instrument that has been on his desk for months regarding the proposal to make the Irish Aviation Authority the competent body to assess night flights and planning restrictions at Dublin Airport. I would have thought that for the fifth busiest airport in Europe-----

The Government is charged with governing the Republic of Ireland, looking after its welfare, ensuring jobs are created, that people's livelihoods are protected and that the country develops appropriately. In that context, the Minister, Deputy Ross, being the anti-judicial crusader, has spent half his time in the Department of Justice and Equality when he has responsibility for a legislative measure that I and residents in my constituency of Dublin Fingal urgently need in respect of how the airport will develop and how that will impact on the area of north Dublin. He has had it for months. It is about setting up the Irish Aviation Authority as the competent authority to assess matters such as unrestricted night flights and how that will affect local residents and communities in the area. That is what he should be responsible for. He should look after his brief.

The recent Jobstown trial in one of our courts, which I am allowed to comment on, was presided over by a judge. This is relevant to the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017. During that trial members of Solidarity-People Before Profit said publicly and in meetings held across the country and, in particular, in Dublin that they believed the jury selection was unfair, unconstitutional and illegal. They questioned the independence and relevance of the jury. They held public meetings all over the city and big posters were put up throughout Dublin to say that it was an unfair jury selection. They said that it was going to be a big divvy up and that there was a conspiracy in our courts and our judicial system that was stacked against them. That is a very serious charge from Members of the Dáil, but that is what they said. What happened when the jury of their peers acquitted them of the charges before them? It was all forgotten. That jury was absolutely grand and fine. They campaigned and many would say intimidated the members of the jury by sending out live tweets during that court case.

It happened. What happened then? They were acquitted and nothing more was said about it. It was absolutely grand. These are people who give conditional support to our judicial system, and it is they who are supporting the changes being proposed by the Government. The Government is depending on that group of people to get this flawed legislation through the Dáil. That is seriously worrying. The Government is taking a wrecking ball to the judicial system on the basis of a personal crusade by the Minister, Deputy Ross, who is unable to be here again today. Perhaps he is in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport doing what he should be doing. It is supported by Sinn Féin and Solidarity-People Before Profit. I ask the Minister and any other Member to list what judicial appointments they believe were incorrect and what judges they believe have been corrupted, have not done the job they were supposed to do or have not upheld the laws of this country. I believe the Judiciary has served the State very well. Others might not because of the DNA within their political movements, which late in the day have come around to recognising the courts and the State. There are some people who, in their DNA, have no regard or respect for our judicial system. They are the people who are supporting the Minister, Deputy Flanagan's Bill, which is really the Minister, Deputy Ross's Bill. The Government should take another look at the Bill and assess whether it is doing the right thing. I believe it is not. It is bringing forward some very serious changes to a process and judicial system that have served the State well against many threats over the years, perpetrated by many different terrorist groups and political parties. That is a fact.

I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. My party and I believe the judicial appointments process needs to be reformed. The reason for this is to ensure that people are appointed to judicial office based on merit, but we have very serious concerns about the legislation as presented. As the Minister will have heard from previous speakers, we strongly believe this legislation, and the rushed manner in which it has been progressed through the House, is the result of a political decision to appease one of the Minister's Cabinet colleagues. That is the wrong reason for introducing the legislation. It has taken up a lot of time. Even the Minister's own colleagues would quietly acknowledge that this is not the best way to go about it. As the Dáil is coming to the summer recess, it is unfortunate that issues which I, and many of my colleagues, believe should be debated in this House are being avoided. We could be debating many of the areas of responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Ross, who is not here and who has fought for this legislation tooth and nail. This really goes back to a decision made by the outgoing Taoiseach a number of weeks ago regarding the appointment of the then Attorney General to the Court of Appeal. If we could visualise what Cabinet looked like that day, members would have been around the table and this decision would have been made in the dying moments of the last Taoiseach's tenure. What went on that day, with no political interference and no outside interference, and out of nowhere, was that the long-term campaign of the Minister, Deputy Ross, to have Stepaside Garda station reopened was successful and an announcement to that effect was made. What was going on at Cabinet? The Minister, Deputy Ross, was tweeting and texting colleagues, friends and supporters in his own constituency to tell them that, without any political interference, the Garda station in Stepaside was to be reopened. In parallel with that, the decision to appoint the Attorney General to the Court of Appeal went ahead. That was the wrong decision at that stage and the wrong manner in which to make it but it went unnoticed by the Minister, Deputy Ross. Since then, the price to appease him has been the introduction of this legislation. It is the wrong way to do it. If the Government was honest about it and recognised it for what it was, it could have dealt with this issue differently, working with the legislation Deputy Jim O'Callaghan published almost a year earlier. The issue of dealing with judicial reform and judicial appointments based on merit is something my party and I have recognised for some time. In my view this legislation is flawed in many ways. I want to reiterate that extensive time has been spent discussing this legislation rather than other issues. We do not often get chances to bring up issues and I will not open them to full debate, but as we are coming to the summer recess, there are ongoing issues which have not been dealt with and which should have been dealt with. One example is the issue of a new national drugs strategy, which should have been published last April. There are difficulties with it. Those difficulties are not being articulated and Members of this House are not being told about them. Members should have an opportunity to discuss these issues before the Dáil goes into recess. Likewise, we all know that there is a mid-term capital review under way, which will have consequences for years to come. Capital programmes are not switched on and off annually. There is forward planning involved. In light of the fact the mid-term review is under way and Ministers and Departments have all made submissions to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I asked the Taoiseach if he would make those submissions public and have a debate on them. We will return after the summer recess to see the tangible effects of that review on the budget without any real and meaningful engagement by the House. A minority Government will have made a decision which will have an impact on people for years to come. That issue should be discussed in full in this House. Tomorrow we will spend just two hours discussing the quarterly housing report. Each and every one of us as public representatives, regardless of our constituency, face people every day who are in distress as a result of housing issues. We are not adequately addressing these issues. We address them partially in committees and sub-committees, but the substantial flaws in the delivery of the required scale of a housing response should mainly be debated on the floor of this House. It is one of the significant issues which does not receive the time which it merits, yet this Judicial Appointments Commission Bill does. I will refer back to the Bill directly after this, but in terms of Dublin and the Minister's own responsibilities, the issue of public transport is of concern. I have asked the Minister questions time and again, whether in Topical Issue debates or through parliamentary questions, and he clearly acknowledges the difficulties and that traffic congestion in Dublin is growing year on year. The problem I have with his responses is that he never gives an answer detailing specific actions we can take nor debates the actions we can take to improve the situation. Instead he says that it is an issue for the National Transport Authority or Transport Infrastructure Ireland. These are the substantial issues which I come across every day, as do the people in my constituency, yet we are spending another day in this House debating this Bill.  As I said at the beginning, we support the principle of this Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and we published our own Bill in advance. It is a pity the Bill published by Deputy O'Callaghan had not been developed in partnership because I believe it could be more meaningful legislation. I want to look briefly at a number of elements of the Bill that are of concern. The first one has been referred to on a number of occasions, which is the composition of the membership of the commission. The Bill as put forward by the Government proposes a commission of 13 persons. Three of them are to be judges. It goes on to say that the Chief Justice and a choice between the President of the Court of Appeal or the President of the High Court will also be members. It does not specify who will fill the remaining positions, which is a considerably different composition from that outlined in Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill. His Bill proposes a membership of 12, five of whom would be judicial members and seven of whom would be non-judicial members. With regard to the seven, rather than leaving them in limbo where they could be anyone appointed by the Minister or something like that, they are from representative organisations which would have influence and an understanding of the legal system, for example the Bar Council; the Law Society; Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC; and the Citizens Information Board. That is a good way to ensure that an appointing commission would be representative and understanding of the issues.  Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill also makes reference to the type of person and their merits from the point of view of their qualifications and their suitability. It mentions that it is important the commission be apprised of the qualities of the person to be appointed and that they would need integrity, independence of mind, moral courage and a high level of intellectual skill. Some of those qualities are actually specified in the Bill which Deputy O'Callaghan put forward.  Of particular concern is the fact that the Attorney General seems to have a dual role in this process in terms of having a role on the commission while also sitting at Cabinet. That is a fundamental flaw. If we are trying to establish an independent system, the fact the Attorney General could be in both positions is a flaw.  Significantly, I note that the commission would recommend three people. There would be no order of merit. It would be little more than a system of processing or filtering where a number of people would apply and three people would be recommended to Cabinet. I understand there is no obligation on Cabinet so I ask the question, if this Bill was introduced instead of the 1995 Act, what would have been done differently in terms of the process in respect of the former Attorney General? Having just three names being put forward without a recognition of suitability, priority or who might be the best person for the job is insufficient and such elements should be included. They were certainly incorporated into the understanding of the situation put forward by Deputy O'Callaghan. I have spoken about the composition of the committee. There is something spiteful about the fact the Chief Justice is to be a member of the committee but not the chairperson. In most organisations, if the senior person is on a sub-committee or group, he or she will tend to have the leading role.I do not know the reason for it, but it shows disrespect and spitefulness towards the position and I do not know what the purpose of it is. There are many reasons I believe the Bill is flawed and suggest that if it is to be processed and proceeded with, we would do well to look at the Bill introduced by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, especially on such issues as the make-up of the commission, the role of the Attorney General and the ranking of candidates. While the Minister has acted with haste to get the Bill to this Stage, a period of pause and reflection is definitely necessary to ensure the outcome for which we are all striving, namely, that people of merit will be appointed in a transparent and open manner, is achieved.
#FionaOLoughlin	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-party	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-dob	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	75	Increasingly in this country we have a society that is out of sync and the judicial system is hugely important. The bedrock of our democracy is the rule of law, which means that we must have an independent Judiciary. We should live our lives based on the Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is; therefore, the Judiciary is the safeguard of the people, our liberty and property. I have often heard it said that for society to succeed, we need brave prosecutors and fearless judges. Therefore, how judges are appointed is hugely important in our democracy. While Fianna Fáil fully believes in the need for reform of the judicial appointments system, we believe the new Bill published by the Government is deeply flawed. Fianna Fáil, in particular Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, our spokesperson on justice, has proposed legislation to establish a judicial appointments commission which would be fully independent of the Government and make recommendations to it based on an independent assessment of the merits of applicants for judicial office. With its proposals for a lay majority and the downgrading of the Chief Justice's position, the Government has let the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, drive forward a spurious agenda which risks undermining the independence of the Judiciary. I wish to make some general points about why we need reform and to set out some of the good reasons for it. 
The reason the judicial appointments process needs to be reformed is to ensure people are appointed to judicial office based solely on merit, not on political patronage. For that reason, Fianna Fáil's proposed legislation seeks to establish a judicial appointments commission that would be fully independent of the Government. The commission proposed by the Government will not allow for such an independent process of assessment. Among its faults is that it will require the Chief Justice to sit on a commission that she will not chair. That is indicative of the disrespect the Government has for the Judiciary. A proposal that the Taoiseach sit on a committee but not be its chairman would be dismissed out of hand by the Government. One could ask what is different in this case.  The Bill also excludes the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court from full membership of the commission. It is also recommended that the majority of the commission be lay members, namely, persons who are neither judges nor lawyers. The grouping of judges and lawyers in the same category by the Government ignores the fact that judges are not members of the legal profession. The fact that they were previously members is not a basis on which to assume that judges and lawyers, if in a majority, will have a negative influence on the commission. It would be considered remarkable if surgeons in hospitals were selected by a panel, the majority of members of which had never carried out surgery, nor even worked in a hospital. The Bill proposes that the three persons recommended by the commission not be ranked in order of merit. The failure to do so defeats the entire purpose of having a commission that will seek to recommend the best candidate. It is regrettable that the proposals put forward by the Government are not for the purpose of achieving genuine political reform but are instead designed to appease one member of the Government whose proposals in this area are ill considered and deeply flawed. That is evident in his announcement that Stepaside Garda station was to be one of the six Garda stations to be reopened at a time when there was no mention of the other five. Fianna Fáil remains committed to achieving reform in this area, as outlined in our Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. I will now turn to weaknesses in the current system. When a large list of names is presented to the Cabinet, in fairness, most Ministers do not know how to go about choosing one person from a list of 24 to fill a District Court position, for example. There is no reason politicians should be aware of who is the most suitable or best candidate. State papers from 30 years ago published in the new year included a record of Alan Dukes stating, when Minister for Justice, that he did not know who was the best candidate or who should be selected to be a judge. He said he felt it was a matter primarily for the Attorney General. In fairness to members of the Cabinet, most of them do not know who are the most suitable candidates and it is unfair to put that pressure on the Government when it must be completely separate from the judicial process. If RTE was appointing a new director general, it would follow the process of setting out the selection criteria and a selection body would then identify an individual to be be recommended. The Cabinet could disagree with the recommendation made, but, in general, it would accept it. It is true that people who have political connections are at an advantage if their names are on the list which goes to the Cabinet. It is often said canvassing should be prohibited and I repeat that call. However, it is a fair point that many who are appointed because of political connections turn out to be excellent judges. We should not have a system under which, because a person is involved in politics, he or she should be excluded from subsequent nomination to judicial office. What we do not know is whether good people who applied to be judges were overlooked and never got the opportunity to be promoted to the position of judge because they did not know anybody in the Cabinet or any Deputy. For all of these reasons, the system needs to be changed. We in Fianna Fáil are recommending a body that could identify who it believed would be the best person to become a judge. We should have a recommending body that would rank individuals based on their suitability for the job. Under the Constitution, as is appropriate, the Government has the final say. Regardless of what system is in place or how it operates, the Government can disregard the list of candidates provided by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and appoint a candidate of its choosing. That is the system that operates under the Constitution. However, it needs to be changed and broadened to ensure it is fairer and that the best people will have an opportunity to be considered and appointed. The Fianna Fáil Bill proposes that the names of those considered to be the most suitable candidates to be judges, based on merit, be put forward. For each position, the commission would recommend three people. The Government's scheme includes the same provision, but under our Bill the three candidates would be ranked. In no way would that offend the constitutional prerogative that rests with the Cabinet. Under neither scheme would the Cabinet have to opt for anyone on the list. However, there would be a benefit in the Cabinet being told by a body with expertise that it believed the following were the three best people in a certain order. The membership of the commission is of the utmost importance. We must consider who would be best qualified to recommend candidates. The people who know are generally judges and others with experience. Interestingly, the Fine Gael-led Government has adopted - hook, line and sinker - the language of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, which is all about lay people and non-lay people. It is offensive to judges that under the Government's scheme non-lay people are described as being judges and lawyers. Judges are not practising lawyers. They were previously lawyers. It is wrong and misleading of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, to give the impression that judges and lawyers should be regarded as belonging to the same group. We should get away from that impression.

In introducing this legislation the Minister for Justice and Equality is acting on an instruction from the Taoiseach arising from the protestations of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, concerning a commitment he gave on this matter before entering Government. We are led to believe that a condition of the Minister entering Government was that he would overhaul and change the system of appointing judges to the courts. Notwithstanding his public statements that all appointments made in the past 22 years by all Governments were fantastic and those who obtained office as a result have carried out their duties with aplomb, probity, independence and distinction and exercised the rule of law as the Constitution would have them exercise it, the Minister continues to believe the system of judicial appointments must be overhauled. In the past 12 months, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has been party to the appointment of approximately 15 judges to various courts. He is as responsible for these appointments as the former and current Minister for Justice and Equality and all other members of the Cabinet who share collective responsibility for judicial appointments. The Minister feigns disillusionment, disappointment and surprise following the recent appointment of the former Attorney General to the Court of Appeal, despite having participated in the passage of the enabling legislation introduced in 1995 to provide for a more informed process for making such appointments following the appointment in 1995 of Harry Whelehan by the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and his Government. The following week, he wanted a review of the legislation. However, if his ideology or principles are as he would like us to believe, he would have taken the same course of action as Labour Party Ministers took in 1995 when they had the gumption not to agree to the appointment. At least the Labour Party Ministers walked out of Cabinet because they would not be party to such an appointment or the manner in which it was made, despite the commitments that had been given and the fact that the Taoiseach at the time acted within his rights. I will not go into that, however. Following the appointment of Harry Whelehan as Attorney General, the then Taoiseach made himself and his Cabinet available for questions and debate. The Government had to bow to this precedent by allowing a period of questions following the recent appointment to the Court of Appeal, despite the great folly of the process involved. If the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport meant what he said about overhauling the system for appointing judges, we would not have a Bill such as this before us. This is enabling legislation to give effect to the right of the Cabinet to make an appointment. If it is passed in the face of the reservations of many Opposition and Government Deputies, the same thing that happened a couple of weeks ago could happen again. The Minister knows that but seeks to pull the wool over the eyes of the public by trying to give an impression that he can make changes that will prevent something of this nature ever happening again. That is not the truth, however, and if he does not say so loudly and clearly, we will do so repeatedly. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was bought off with the reopening of Stepaside Garda station and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was bought off with another 200 cigarettes. It seems this is what it takes to make progress within the farcical set-up that the Independent Alliance would have us believe is governance.

The Minister was photographed with some councillor from the area who is affiliated to him. If he had no idea what was coming, he showed magical powers by producing the banner in the manner in which he did. I heard Deputy Eamon Ryan on radio this morning discussing the Rugby World Cup 2023 Bill, which will come before the House tomorrow. As the Minister with direct responsibility for this matter, one would expect the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to have the foresight and manners to exercise his duty and allow a committee to discuss the merits of a bid being made on behalf of the people. The bid has major potential but the approach being taken creates grave doubts about the Minister's capability to hold the office to which he has been appointed, let alone interfere in the responsibilities of other Ministers who were given their duties by the Taoiseach. The way to change the way judicial appointments are made is to hold a referendum to amend the Constitution and remove the constitutional right of the Cabinet to make such appointments. Rather than do this, the Minister is seeking to pull the wool over the eyes of Deputies and citizens about how this is done but he is not codding anybody. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is wasting precious Government time by having the Government prioritise this Bill at the expense of much more pressing legislation. The Government should detail to the House the reasons for the delay in producing legislation to give effect to many of the recommendations that have emanated from motions and Private Members' Bills and in the pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills by various committees of the House. We have not heard these reasons because the Minister would have us believe that this is the way business is done. This is the how he gives effect to his feigned commitment. The Minister has been 30 years in the Houses of the Oireachtas, yet it has taken 12 months to draft the legislation he claims he has been trying to introduce for such a long time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	79	Yesterday, agents from the European Commission competition directorate raided the offices of motor insurance providers in Ireland as part of an investigation into anti-competitive practices. The Commission said it had concerns that the companies involved may have engaged in anti-competitive practices in breach of European Union anti-trust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices or abuse of a dominant market position. In a separate development, it emerged that the offices of Insurance Ireland were visited by compliance officers as part of a European Union investigation into access to two databases used by insurance providers in the Republic. The investigations are on foot of complaints from new entrants to the market. The databases involved are Insurance Link and the Integrated Information Data Service, which were dealt with by an Oireachtas committee in some length over a year ago. When most people heard this news, they said at long last somebody is doing something to stop the great rip-off of consumers by motor insurance companies and the insurance industry in general. We have witnessed increases of over 60% or more since 2011, 51% from 2014 onwards in motor insurance itself. These are extraordinary increases which people have experienced. People are generally fed up with what they perceive to be total inaction and ineffective interventions to give some fair play to consumers. They feel there are many platitudes and reports but no action. Essentially, it seems the Government stood by while these incredible increases were allowed to take place without any effective intervention. Back in November, the Oireachtas all-party committee on finance finalised its report and raised the necessity of access to the two databases referred to as a matter of urgency. That recommendation was based on an earlier Department of Finance report in June 2016. Essentially, it seems it has taken Europe and the European Commission to shine a light on this, shake it up and seriously engage with the issues. It is not just car insurance but other areas of insurance. Many businesses have come under pressure in this regard. Most people would accept that when they went looking for car insurance over the past several years there was little evidence of any competition in the marketplace. Will the Taoiseach accept that the Government's response, as well as that of the agencies involved such as the Central Bank, raises questions as to how the insurance industry has been progressing in recent times? Will he accept the Government's response has been pathetically slow in dealing with this crisis for many consumers? Is the tolerance threshold for anti-competitive behaviour too high? That is a fundamental question we need to ask ourselves. Why has access to the two databases, in particular, been so restrictive? The industry has made all sorts of claims over the past several years, but they are not verifiable because of the absence of transparent comprehensive data.

Nobody in this House wants to say anything that could prejudice that investigation. However, the whole issue of rising insurance costs is a big one and is severely impacting on individuals, families and businesses. It is not just the rising cost of motor insurance, but also home and business insurance, all of which have gone up considerably in recent years and have had a considerable impact on households and businesses. Much action has been taken. As the Deputy will be aware, over the past several months, the insurance task force, headed up by the then Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, reported and measures have been taken to implement its findings, including a fraud register, changes to the book of quantum and legislation, just approved by the Cabinet, to ensure better use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. We are already seeing results. For example, this year so far, insurance costs have moderated and, in some cases, have actually fallen.

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission advised the Department of Finance that the raids in question were not connected to its current investigation of the motor industry. In addition, a press release from the European Commission stated: The European Commission can confirm that [on 4 July 2017] its officials carried out unannounced inspections at the premises of companies active in motor insurance in the Republic of Ireland. The Commission has concerns that the companies involved may have engaged in anti-competitive practices in breach of EU anti-trust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices and/or abuse of a dominant market position. The Commission officials were accompanied by their counterparts from the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. Unannounced inspections are a preliminary step into suspected anti-competitive practices. The fact that the Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation. The Commission respects the rights of defence, in particular the right of companies to be heard in any [anti-trust] proceedings. There is no legal deadline to complete inquiries into anti-competitive conduct. Their duration depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of each case, the extent to which the companies concerned co-operate with the Commission and the exercise of the rights of defence.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	84	We all know the last section. However, people will be somewhat taken aback by the Taoiseach’s comment that we are getting results. Most people are angry when the car insurance bill comes in. It is a serious hit on people's disposable income. When one looks at the scale of the increases over the past four to five years, over 60% from 2012 onwards, these are extraordinary increases. Task forces have done nothing. I recall in the early 2000s when the Personal Injuries Assessment Board was established, it was effective at that time in getting spiralling costs under control. There seems to have been an acceptance of the insurance industry’s claims around the high cost of awards, etc, without verification. The 2016 Oireachtas committee recommended an integrated insurance database service be completed as a matter of urgency, that it must be independently verified, policed by the Central Bank of Ireland to ensure it is correctly populated, that it becomes an open source of information available to all insurance companies, all brokers and intermediaries, and any foreign insurance companies seeking to enter the Irish insurance market. In other words, there is a sense of a closed shop to new entrants and the lack of competition is an area the Government has not addressed over the past several years. It has been pathetically slow in following through on recommendations made. It has taken the European Commission to wake everybody up in official Ireland with regard to the insurance industry. It has been an incredible and unacceptable rip-off of customers in our society. Who protects the consumer?

That is why we established the task force under the Minister, Deputy Murphy. That task force reported not too long ago. As I mentioned earlier, measures are being taken to moderate the rise in insurance costs. The rise has moderated. It is now a question of bringing those costs down. It is important that insurance costs do come down. The Government will take whatever actions it can take to ensure this. It could be achieved, for example, through better use of the Personal Injuries Board, putting together the necessary databases, using a register of fraud and by having a revised quantum, work on which is now under way. In addition, the building of a real Single Market across Europe in terms of services is a factor. We often talk about a Single Market in Europe but it is evident in some areas that we do not really have one. It should be much easier for people in Ireland to buy their insurance from other countries.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	88	The Government is now over a month behind in allocating special needs assistants, SNAs, to schools for the forthcoming school year. This comes hot on the heels of an overwhelming number of appeals by schools regarding their special needs allocation under the new resource model. These delays are causing serious distress in families and communities. Parents of children with special needs are this morning at their wits' end. They do not know whether their child will have access to an SNA in September or, if they do, how many hours of SNA support they will receive. As we know, SNAs help children to feel safe and secure in meeting the challenges of school. They focus on the specific challenges of children with special needs and help them to cope with and overcome them. These children will struggle in mainstream school settings without the support of an SNA. The work of an SNA is very valuable. Knowing that they will have such support is a great source of confidence for children and parents during the back-to-school period. The delay has robbed children and their parents of that confidence. School has now finished for the summer so schools are not in a position to make plans or prepare children for potential changes in the new term. School principals are placed in the extremely difficult position of not being able to tell SNAs employed by their school whether they will have a job when the children come back in September. I have been contacted by numerous SNAs expressing their fears for the future. One wrote to me and asked how what is happening could be fair on SNAs. She stated they deserve respect and to know where their future lies. She contends it is the same old story every year, involving uncertainty and unease. She stated she is a parent to two children and has a mortgage. She claims SNAs need answers and, more important, stability regarding their future. Does the Taoiseach believe it is acceptable to leave children, parents and SNAs in this position of uncertainty and fear? Schools, parents and children are now in limbo over the lack of clarity as to the resources that will be available in September. This is not good enough. There really is no excuse. The kind of slapdash approach to the allocations contrasts sharply with how schools are treated if they miss deadlines for applications for resources. The Taoiseach and Minister for Education and Skills need to ensure this critical information on allocations is provided to schools as a matter of urgency. The Taoiseach also needs to review his procedures to ensure the information is provided every year in good time. What is the cause of the current delay? Will the Taoiseach now tell the children, parents and SNAs when the allocations are to be finally made?

We want all children to be able to avail themselves fully of the educational opportunities that are made available to them in our schools. The Government is absolutely committed to that. We have shown proof of that in recent years. There are now approximately 13,000 SNAs. There are more SNAs than gardaí, for example. In addition, almost 20% of the education budget is spent on special education. That is good evidence of the Government's commitment. It is putting manpower and money behind its commitment. The Cabinet discussed this matter this morning and made two decisions. The first was to allocate an additional 975 SNAs for September. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, will be detailing that announcement in the next day or two. It is July so people will know well before September what allocation they are going to get. The first decision was to allocate an additional 975 SNAs. The second was that we would not decide in the same way again in that we are not going to have this process we have had for a number of years now, whereby decisions on the number of SNAs are made relatively late in the year and into the summer. The first decision was to have 975 additional SNAs allocated for the forthcoming school year. The second decision was that we would make this part of the normal Estimates process so we will know long in advance what the allocation for 2018 will be, exactly for the reason the Deputy outlined, namely, the fact that people should not have to wait until July to find out what is available in September.

The evidence of the Government's commitment in this area is fairly scant and mixed given that, year on year, families and children are left in limbo, as I have outlined. I am very pleased to hear there will be additional resources. I look forward to hearing the Minister setting out the details. This, however, does not answer the central question that is on the minds of SNAs and parents and causing distress to some children. For the next school year, commencing in September, when will people know whether they will have the support of an SNA? What will be the extent of that support? When will schools be in a position to say to SNAs they have a job? I look forward to the Minister setting out the new procedure that the Taoiseach has referred to. God knows, it is convoluted. It is not helped and is in fact aggravated by the uncertainty in this sector. What caused the delay? Will SNAs and families hear this week or next week whether the SNAs will have a job? Can we have a date, please?

As I said, there will be an additional 975 SNAs in place for September. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, will give the detail in a statement this week. Therefore, everyone will know this week where they stand for September. In future years, the decision will be made much earlier because it will be part of the normal Estimates process, which is in October. There will be plenty of notice for the first quarter of 2018. The Deputy is absolutely correct that the need is great. The response, however, is also great. Let me give some examples of the kind of response the Government has put in place in recent years to assist children in education with special educational needs. The budget for special needs has increased by 32% since 2011. It is now €1.68 billion. The number of SNAs has increased by 23% since 2011, from just over 10,000 to 13,000. The number of special classes has increased by 120% since 2011. That is just to give a few examples of the very real response that the Government has put in place to the very real and enormous need that exists.

While socks and jogging might have captured the headlines, it seems clear from Prime Minister Trudeau's comments that he was here for one specific reason, building support for the free trade agreement between Canada and the European Union, CETA. Like most Members of this House, I understand the benefits of globalised trade. Such trade has reduced global poverty and has enriched many lives and brought people back to work. We must also be aware of the negative impacts of globalisation, however. CETA has been a long time coming. It is welcome that it proposes to replace investor-state dispute settlements, which were secretive arbitration panels that allowed investors to challenge government regulation behind closed doors. The Japan-EU deal has been grappling with this exact issue. While a move away from the existing model may be welcome, replacing it with investment courts does not go nearly far enough.The proposed courts are not transparent and they pay little attention to democratic politics or the right of individual countries to regulate in their own national interest. As a country, we have suffered immensely as a result of light touch regulation, or deregulation. The banking crisis and much of the shoddy building work in this State over the last 20 years are testament to that. Therefore, we have more reason than most to question any structures that would allow investors or companies to challenge the robust regulation we now have. As The Financial Times - no bastion of left-wing thinking - has pointed out, in highly developed legal systems, including those of the EU, Canada and Japan, there is really no need for a separate adjudication forum for investors. Therefore, there is much political reason to insist on our own domestic courts. Japan, Canada and the EU should be comfortable with the national courts making decisions where conflicts arise, in particular given the presence of international treaty obligations of non-discriminatory treatments for investors and companies. Several months have now passed since the Seanad voted for a variety of reasons against the ratification of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA. Can the Taoiseach indicate the view of Government on the vote of the Seanad in the first instance and can he tell the House when he will bring the agreement for formal decision and ratification before the House?

The purpose of the visit was to cement the bonds of friendship that exist between our two countries and governments. We discussed many different issues in our meetings, but free trade and CETA, which is a free trade agreement between the EU and Canada, were things we discussed in depth. While some countries may be turning their backs on free trade, this country, those in the EU and Canada are absolutely committed to it. We understand that free trade in the round makes us all better off and creates good jobs and opportunities for businesses and individuals. Both countries are very committed to CETA and want to see it implemented as soon as possible. While there are always arguments over free trade agreements, once they are in place very few people want to pull back from them. That is why we are trying to retain the free trade agreements we have with the UK because we know they make us better off. That is also why we joined the EU. We all know the EU has made us better off. CETA will be no different. It will be a successful and progressive free trade agreement that creates jobs and opportunities for people. That is what government is all about. It is intended that provisional ratification will occur in the next couple of months. That will give us about 80% of the benefits of the deal. We will remove tariffs from the vast majority of goods that are traded between the two countries. We do not have a date for formal ratification, which involves the court procedure that the Deputy mentioned, as yet. There is no timeline for it. Only two countries in the EU have so far ratified it and we do not have any plans to do so in the next couple of months, but will do so in due course. What is crucial to us is provisional ratification because that is what removes the tariff barriers. Removing the tariff barriers is the mechanism by which we will get the most benefits economically.

That means having a proper debate in the House, ventilating real concerns in an open and honest way and finding solutions that will bring the bulk of our people with us. Even in advance of the provisional ratification, will the Taoiseach arrange for a proper debate in this House with a formal motion put by Government so that we can address the concerns outlined by various elements in society and build the biggest consensus we can for an agreement that meets those concerns?

We have a vast political consensus in Ireland in favour of free trade and its benefits to business, individuals and the economy. Ratification of the agreement in full will require a motion and a debate in the Dáil.

Some 150 million tonnes of that plastic is now in our seas. We are adding a dump truck every minute. We have to stop this and cut out the waste. It is not easy. It takes attention. This is vital to the question of how much people have to pay, because rather than having to pay for all that and work out whether it is recycling, which most of it is not when 40% of that plastic ends up in the dump, we need to start to make it easy for the householder to do the right thing. That is why I make this point, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Yesterday, I wrote a letter to each of the party leaders and group leaders asking if they would support our Waste Reduction Bill, which does two things that the best international research, such as the New Plastics Economy paper from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, recommends as simple measures in order to start doing the right thing. It proposes the introduction a returned deposit of 10 cent on bottles and containers so that householders, rather than seeing these bottles go out to be dumped, can see them saved, recycled and used again. Second, the Bill proposes a ban on plastic cups. These cups are not recyclable. One would think they were with the logo on them, but they are not. However, there are instead alternatives-----

I am just trying to make a point. I also recognise that we have done a lot of good. We have increased our recycling over the last 15 or 20 years. However, at this point when the householder is going to have to pay for all that stuff that goes into the black bin, will the Taoiseach and his Government introduce and support the Waste Reduction Bill that we have produced? Every environmental NGO of note has stated its support for it. I heard Deputy Sherlock make a similar point in the House last night. We have to review what we are doing with Repak and not just change the charging system, but change the way we manage waste.

I have not had the chance to read it yet. We will certainly consider it when it is brought to the floor of the House. I think Deputy Ryan will agree with what we are trying to achieve here. First, we want to reward people who recycle, reuse, compost and reduce their waste. It is not right that somebody who does not do those things should pay the same as somebody who does. We want to make sure people who do the right thing by their community and by the environment, and who reuse, reduce, recycle and compost pay less than those who do not. That is a part of the reason for the move away from flat charges to the pay-by-lift or pay-by-weight arrangement, which already exists in at least half the country.We also want to make it easier for people to do the right thing and make the right choices. That is why it will now be a requirement to provide the brown bin in any population centre of more than 500. That will be in place quite soon.  In addition, the Minister is looking at introducing large-scale recycling bins outside supermarkets to reduce waste at source in order that people who buy things in a supermarket would be able to dispose of the packaging inside or outside it. For a start, that would be of benefit to them in reducing their waste, but, second, it would make supermarkets and manufacturers think twice about the packaging they use if it went straight back to them and never even managed to make it to somebody's home.  We will also introduce a new scheme to manage end-of-life vehicles to stop and reduce the dumping of vehicles. We will also launch a new scheme to manage waste tyres which we will believe will help to tackle the widespread dumping of used tyres, in country areas in particular.

I am supportive of the Minister. It is not an easy job, but he has signalled today that he does not want to change the current system. That is the point I am making. We need to win the hearts and minds of the people and not turn this into another water charges row. We have to be seen as not just changing the charging system but helping people by introducing a deposit refund scheme and cutting out waste at source. This is a very concrete, specific and achievable measure. The Taoiseach will have to win over the Minister and his Department as they do not want to do it because it would be tough and not easy, but it is being done in France where these cups will be banned by 2020. In loads of countries the deposit is given back and they have seen recycling rates go up to 90%. I hope the Bill will be brought to the floor of the House. If we do not have wait several months and can get another party to be the lead party, we would have a majority in the House. I am asking the Government to reconsider its position and support such practical measures in order that the people would know that we were making it easier for them to cut back on the black bin charge.

To the best of my recollection, the Bill has not yet come before the Cabinet; therefore, there has not yet been a Government decision on it. We will need to study it. First, we need to ensure it will not transgress any rule relating to the Single Market and will not raise revenue implications. If, however, it is something that is being done in other European countries, perhaps it might be done here. The Government has an open mind in considering good ideas that will allow us to reduce waste and protect the environment.

On improved accountability, there was a rather disturbing report in this morning's edition of The Irish Times on the questioning of the judgment of an experienced pilot by the former Minister for Defence of a flight that did not take off because of fog at Cork Airport. The former Minister rang the pilot, which I find extremely surprising. There were sharp exchanges between the two. There was also the revelation that the Air Corps was very unhappy as something like this had never happened in over 25 years. There are a number of key issues. First, it could be construed as intimidation or putting pressure on the pilot, although I am not saying it was. We have seen this happen in other countries and jurisdictions with terrible results. In other words, the issue of safety comes to mind. The professional's judgment should be final. I do not know whether the former Minister has clarified the report carried in The Irish Times this morning, but safety should never be compromised by anyone's diary and there should be clear protocols in place. Has the Government laid down clear protocols for this kind of thing in order that professional judgment on whether flights can take off can in no way be compromised? Has the former Minister been held accountable by the Government and has he been asked to apologise to the Air Corps about the incident?

As I was formerly the Minister with responsibility for transport and aviation safety, it is an area about which I know a little and in which I certainly took an interest when I held that brief. Everyone in the House can be assured that, as far as we are concerned, when it comes to aviation, safety comes first. It is always the pilot's decision, not the passenger's, whether they should fly. It is not correct to characterise somebody who called the pilot as being intimidatory. I certainly do not think that was the former Minister's intention; rather, it was just to ask a question. There is no suggestion the former Minister or any Minister in the Government would try to second-guess the judgment of a pilot.

As the Taoiseach knows, the living wage is evidence-based and the rate of pay a full-time worker needs in order that he or she can experience a socially acceptable standard of living, certainly not a gold-plated standard of living but a threshold of decency. The Taoiseach will be aware that the rate of €11.70 is well in excess of the current national minimum wage which stands at €9.25, the rate earned by many who rise early in the morning and go out to work. The programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the national minimum wage to €10.50 in the next five years. This figure still falls well short of what has been independently judged to be a minimum living wage. In the programme for Government the Government states the reason for raising the national minimum wage is to reduce poverty levels. Given that the cost of living is outstripping any such increase, last year's increase in particular, will the Taoiseach accept that the Government needs to be more ambitious in its targets? Will he accept that it needs to adopt a policy of payment of the living wage to workers in order that a socially acceptable standard of living will be afforded to workers, citizens and their families?

Despite that commitment and the commitment outlined by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald in the programme for Government, so far the Government has only managed to increase the national minimum wage by 10 cent. It has refused to amend the terms of reference of the Low Pay Commission that would make even reaching this low target a possibility. This morning the living wage technical group published its 2017 report which recommended a living wage of €11.70 per hour. Given the continuing rise in the cost of housing instanced, this will come as little surprise to anybody. Leaving aside the recommendation which I do not believe the Government will embrace, there is a formal resolution of the Dáil. Will the Taoiseach tell us in plain terms when and how either the resolution of the Dáil of last year that we work towards 60% of median earnings or the commitment contained in the programme for Government to at least reach €10.50 per hour will be achieved?

There is a programme for Government commitment to increase the statutory minimum wage. In the past five years the national minimum wage has been increased on three occasions. It has been increased by about 20% during that period, at a higher rate than the increase in wages generally. I am sure it will be increased further into the future.The minimum wage is determined on a statutory basis by the Low Pay Commission and the Low Pay Commission considers all the empirical evidence, including input from unions, from employers, from NGOs and from advocacy groups, and takes into account a number of different things. Those include not just the cost of living, but also the potential impact on employment and displacement. As I understand it, the living wage technical group is separate. It is non-statutory and it is comprised of a number of groups, including trade unions and community and voluntary sector advocacy groups. It is based on certain assumptions-----

I put an amendment to the Bill asking for a report within three months and what the Taoiseach was going to do to tackle the gross inequality to women under that scheme. They are women who reared their children in the 1970s and 1980s, right up until 1994, who got up early before the Taoiseach was born and did a very thorough job for the people of this country. They are now suffering a loss of between €19 and €30 a week. That is no small fry when one is living on an old age pension of the State, rather than the type of pension that Deputy Enda Kenny will leave this House with in the next few years. This discrimination is continuing unabated. There are now tens of thousands of women who are suffering discrimination because of it. I ask the Taoiseach to please not tell me that if the inequality towards the women is ended, he is going to have to take it off somebody else who is a recipient of social welfare. How about using the EU average of PRSI contributions for those who earn over €100,000 a year and taking what the rest of Europe does for employers' contributions on PRSI? How about looking-----

We hope to move to the total contribution model as practised by other European countries, but that is going to take a while.

We need to know before the summer, before this House breaks, that we will get an announcement, especially on this part regarding disadvantaged children in rural and urban areas, because they are being neglected and denied this funding. It is dormant account funding and is no expense to the Exchequer. Please can we have an announcement on when we will have it.

It has been moving at a snail's pace. In that period, there have been 1,600 alcohol-related deaths. Approximately 800,000 bed-nights have been taken up in hospitals as a result of alcohol-related illnesses, and there have been 420,000 absenteeism days as a result of alcohol abuse. That is imposing a huge human and economic cost on the entire country. The Taoiseach said recently that the completion of this Bill would be a priority. Will he tell us what his proposed timescale is for the completion of this long-awaited legislation? What is the target date for its implementation?

This is being done as a desktop operation. The village of Upperchurch is near me. It is a small rural village where the proposed roll-out excludes the local school and the main employer in the village. There needs to be a physical assessment of what is needed in rural areas before this roll-out happens.

Within our constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, children who break a limb have to wait two whole weeks to get an appointment at the fracture clinic in Drogheda hospital. This medical care is neither timely nor close to a patient's home. I have also been informed that patients attending Cavan General Hospital have had their fracture clinic slots in Drogheda reduced to five slots every two weeks. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to the children of Cavan-Monaghan who break limbs - which happens quite often with children - that they will be seen more often than that?

I am asking that a medical card be made effective from the day the person applies for it. Those with serious illnesses, such as lyme disease, have to travel abroad to get their problems addressed and have to pay a savage cost. The Government indicated that more people will have access to medical cards. I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that those with lyme disease are covered with a medical card because they are enduring savage costs going abroad because the medical care is not here for them.

There was a good system in place previously for those who were terminally ill who had medical cards. Unfortunately, in recent times that system has been failing. When a person has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, within 24 hours of a doctor declaring that it is a terminal illness that person should be issued with a medical card no questions asked.

I ask the Taoiseach respectfully, as a former Minister for Health who understands the enormity of this situation on a family, that when a person is diagnosed with a terminal illness, he or she should be granted a medical card immediately upon a medical practitioner signing off on that terminal illness.

As the Deputies will be aware, the Minister is currently launching the new cancer strategy. It is still supposed to be the case. Somebody who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and is dying is still supposed to receive a medical card automatically. I was not aware of any change in or any problems with regard to that. I have not come across it in my constituency in quite some time. I will certainly check with the Minister of Health if that is the case. In relation to backdating medical cards, I am not sure if that can be done. It is the case for social welfare entitlements that one receives the payments in arrears from the point at which one is entitled, not the point at which one is allocated. I think that is what Deputy Michael Healy-Rae is suggesting. It sounds like a good idea. I am just not sure how practical it would be because it would involved presumably then refunding fees to doctors etc. and that could be difficult to administer. In terms of treatment abroad, patients can apply for treatment abroad under the treatment abroad scheme from the HSE and can also avail of treatment abroad without a means test under the cross-border directive, but of course, it needs to be a recognised treatment.

The Valuation Office conducted a revaluation of the commercial rates across Longford-Westmeath in the last number of months and over 40% of the businesses there saw a significant increase in their annual commercial rates. We were told not to worry that the Government was bringing forward new legislation which would see how commercial rates are charged differently and would be proportionate to the business that is being conducted in these premises. We are now close to summer recess and to my knowledge, this legislation has not been published. When will the legislation be published because these new rates will come into effect on 1 January next year and they run the risk of putting many businesses out of business if not addressed before then?

The revenue is supposed to be the same at the end of it.

We are waiting on a money message from the Taoiseach.

In particular, the Minister will be aware that many took time out during their working career to look after family duties. In practically all of these cases, these were women. They would have not paid PRSI contributions during that period and as a result, their average contributions over their entire adult life are lower than they otherwise would have been resulting in them receiving a lower State pension than they would otherwise have received. When will this discrimination, primarily against women, be ended?

Some of them also suffered salt damage to the crops in late 2015 and the early spring. These farmers have been waiting almost 12 months for compensation. Can the Taoiseach announce any compensation package? Will it take into account that some of these farmers have lost up to €60,000? One must also remember these were being guided towards cheap finance up to now. Many of these farmers did not get the cheap finance. Unfortunately, the farmers who got the cheap finance were those who were not in financial difficulty and those who are in financial difficulty have not got the cheap finance today.

Within 32 minutes six houses that had formed part of a terrace were gutted to the ground. Thankfully, no lives were lost because of the time of the day at which the fire occurred. It emerged afterwards that the building regulations had not been adhered to and that, basically, the builder had cut far too many corners. Many of the families - not only the six whose houses were burnt but the other 84 homeowners in the estate also - are faced every day with fear and negative equity and are having problems in getting insurance cover. The former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, said at that stage that he would commission a report on the causes of the fire and to enable him to make recommendations to existing homeowners. We are still awaiting that report. Will the Taoiseach ensure the report which is sitting on the Minister's desk is released as soon as possible? Can we get a time or date for its release?

Contrary to some reports, the process has not been paused. It is continuing in parallel with the commercial deployment of high-speed broadband by commercial operators. A total of 52% of premises in Ireland have access to high-speed broadband. With the national broadband plan that figure will rise to at least 77% by the end of next year. Eir is delivering high-speed broadband - predominately fibre to the home - to 300,000 premises in rural Ireland. That is subject to a commitment or agreement between Eir and the Minister, whereby Eir has committed to build high-speed broadband infrastructure to serve these 300,000 premises. As a result, they will not need State national broadband plan intervention. The intervention area has been finalised at 542,000 premises and the procurement process is continuing in parallel.

#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	223	One key issue dealt with in the programme for Government relates to rural post offices. The closure of many post offices in rural Ireland is something many fear. We were told that up to 500 post offices could have been on the edge last year. In fairness, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, has done considerable work to get the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post to try to work out a solution. I understand there has been some progress in having an alternative or different model of contract in place. Will the Taoiseach inform us how much progress has been made? When can we expect to see some solution? Many post offices are affected. In our constituency a number are hanging in the balance. Those involved are unsure what will happen. We would like to have some sense of certainty. The post office in my parish of Aughavas is one of those affected. Another is in Ballygawley, County Sligo. There are several others around the country. We, therefore, need to have some sense of closure in that regard. These are all post offices that are associated with small business and they can easily continue to function if they receive some support.

#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	225	I preface my question by saying I do not want the question to be interpreted as being anti-asylum seeker or anti-refugee. The 2016 annual report of the Reception and Integration Agency shows that €64.3 million was spent on running centres for refugees and asylum seekers. The figure represented a rise of 11% on the figure for 2015. A total of €51.7 million was paid to firms to fund the operation of 28 commercially-owned centres. A sum of €7 million was paid to seven centres that were State-owned facilities. As the Taoiseach will appreciate, there is a major difference in the figures. I do not expect him to give me a full answer. However, will the Minister come to the Dáil to inform Members of the breakdown of expenditure? If the Taoiseach can give me a positive answer, it will be acceptable.

#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	228	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the rapid installation of broadband infrastructure; to improve availability of broadband and telecoms services nationally; to provide for the sharing of broadband and telecoms services infrastructure by state agencies (including Transport Infrastructure Ireland) to telecoms and broadband providers; to provide for planning permission to include requirement for ducting to be laid within curtilage of home in new applications; to create a central public register of telecoms infrastructure including ownership; to provide for future cost-effective installation of infrastructure to accommodate future national broadband and telecom connectivity requirements and to provide for related matters.Broadband is a basic human requirement for every household, workplace, school, community centre and premises in the country. It can be seen in the same way the electricity grid was once rolled out and transformed the lives of people throughout the country. It can be seen in the same way that heating, lighting, telephones and basic utilities and services have been rolled out over decades to improve the lives of people throughout the country. Broadband sits in the same category today. There should be a universal service obligation, as there is in the case of telephone connections, power connections and the postal service, etc. It is fundamental to modern life that these services be provided in a high-quality fashion. Many struggle to remain connected to participate in education, work, trade and networks to connect with friends and family owing to the lack of basic connectivity. We see extreme measures throughout the world. In the Third World large unmanned aircraft are beaming down broadband to depopulated sparse rural areas. I hope such extreme means will not be necessary in Ireland, but we had better hurry up with the national broadband plan if we are to avoid them. We have the national broadband plan and tender which we know aspires to deliver broadband to every home in the country. However, the delays have been substantial. We were promised 90% coverage in 2015. We were then promised coverage in 2019. Notwithstanding the Taoiseach's comments today, we have seen reports in the newspapers in recent days to the effect that the date will be 2023 or 2024. It is undeniable that the goalposts keep shifting. Fundamentally, it is taking too long. We have seen multiple task forces and deadlines, but the strategy has yet to be implemented. In the meantime, many areas are suffering from a lack of basic broadband services that could be provided commercially. If some of the impediments or obstacles were removed, the infrastructure could be transformed by filling some of the gaps immediately and tackling the regulatory landscape and the planning framework which do not currently lend themselves to a more rapid roll-out. One year ago I spoke in the House to a motion on rural broadband. It was one of my first debates. I made numerous points about multiple items, including quick wins to accelerate and enable the more rapid roll-out of broadband. There are still those quick wins or options today and they have not yet been tackled. I am proposing a series of common-sense, immediately doable enabling measures to accelerate the roll-out and remove many of the impediments right away. I come to this with first-hand experience having served on a local authority and seen many of the planning framework and other anomalies. I have worked with multiple providers and community groups, throughout rural Kildare in particular, in an attempt to accelerate the roll-out and connect them to better broadband services. I have seen the difficulties faced by communities in trying to access these services and those faced by providers in trying to connect them.It should be noted that the primary target of these measures is broadband. The same infrastructural acceleration would apply to mobile phone and telephony services. Some of the measures in this Bill include the provision of ducting in every new road project across the country, be it a motorway, a back road, a regional road or any other road. Roads should be future-proofed by way of the inclusion of ducting from the get-go to avoid the phenomenon of double-digging, with which all of us as public representatives are familiar. The ducting should be put in once and properly and it should be made available to all providers, be they State, commercial or other providers, at fair and reasonable market cost. One of the complaints of a previous focus group is that the cost of leasing ducting in a motorway or on a railway line is so prohibitively expensive it is often cheaper for an operator to dig up the road and lay new ducting rather than use the ducting in place. This makes no sense. In regard to site-sharing, the Bill provides that where a mast or a piece of infrastructure is being provided, rather than putting in a second or third mirror copy for different operators, that infrastructure should be shared. It should be a mandatory requirement that the infrastructure be made available to any other provider in the area. This would reduce the infrastructure footprint and fast-track roll-out. This makes sense. There is a fair and reasonable market condition built into that also. In terms of planning for new homes and premises, the Bill provides that they should be broadband ready and that ducting should be provided to the curtilage of the building. This is not currently the case. For example, in new builds public roads do not include it to the door of the house. Furthermore, there is a requirement for a central register. ComReg would compile a register of all broadband infrastructure in the State with the assistance of public bodies and commercial operators and this could then be accessed by all stakeholders.  I believe these measures individually and collectively address many of the obstacles around planning and technicalities to accelerate the roll-out of services. I hope all parties will come on board with it as it passes through the Houses. I am happy to accept any amendments that would help to improve the Bill and I commend it to the House.

In accordance with the Public Service Management Act 1997 a new three-year statement of strategy will be prepared by my Department within six months. The current Statement of Strategy 2016 - 2019 reflects the role of the Department which is, to support the Taoiseach and the Government, to develop a sustainable economy and a successful society, to pursue Ireland’s interests abroad, to implement the programme for Government and to build a better future for Ireland and all her citizens. The strategy statement is aligned to the Government’s key priorities and policies and it sets out the following six strategic priorities: providing excellent support services for the Taoiseach and Government; ensuring Ireland has sustainable economy; helping to ensure that Government policies and services support a socially inclusive and fair society; ensuring that Ireland maintains strong relationships in Europe and the World; ensuring the best possible outcomes for Ireland in relation to Brexit - this, of course, includes protecting the common travel area and the peace process; and planning for the future in the context of all of the many uncertainties arising in the international environment. I have already set out to the House a number priorities across Government, including meeting the challenges of Brexit and managing the evolving relationships across Europe and on these Islands. It is also vital that Ireland’s public finances remain on a firm footing as preparations continue for Budget 2018 and a new capital infrastructure plan for Ireland is finalised. Protecting Ireland’s growing economy is critical to ensuring Ireland is an equal society, creating equal opportunities for all its people to participate and share in our prosperity. The new statement of strategy will draw from these areas and outline the priorities to guide the work of my Department for the coming three years. Following its submission to Government, the strategy will be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

The current Department of the Taoiseach strategy statement was only published in February. The Taoiseach indicated the areas which are encompassed by it. What I would like to know now is what changes, in general terms, he intends to bring about in advance of the publication of the formal document. The Taoiseach has indicated a number of changes that he wants to bring about in the Government. He has moved responsibility for Brexit to the Minister and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and he has also appointed an additional super junior Minister. Yesterday, the Taoiseach said that he has reduced the number of Cabinet committees and that he wants a special focus on health. In regard to the revised strategy statement, does the Taoiseach intend to retain the six strategic priorities identified by his predecessor, including planning for the future, Brexit, strong relationships with Europe and the world, a better society, a sustainable economy and support the Taoiseach and Government? Does the Taoiseach intend to broaden those priorities and will there be a particular strategic focus on health? The Taoiseach also mentioned the need for investment in infrastructure. Will there be a particular emphasis on infrastructure in the new strategy statement? In terms of the structure of Government, a considerable amount of time has passed since I wrote to the Taoiseach on the issue of the remuneration packages for the Ministers of State who attend at Cabinet. Has the Taoiseach received advice from the Attorney General on that matter - it is not complicated - and what is his intention in that regard?

I will do that because I would like the matter concluded before the House rises. A new strategy statement is required because the Public Service Management Act requires that any time there is a change of Taoiseach or a change of Minister in any Department a new strategy statement must be produced within six months. I am not necessarily sure that it is a good idea that every time there is a change of Minister or a reshuffle a new strategy statement must be produced. I believe the current strategy statement is quite good. It sets out the six over-arching areas that the Department of the Taoiseach is committed to dealing with. I do not plan to deepen it in sectoral terms. We have a programme for Government and I do not think it is necessary to have different sectoral policies in the new strategy statement. I have not seen the draft of the new strategy statement: it may not be prepared yet. I do not plan it to be a major departure from the strategy that exists already.

What is necessary also is a strategy statement that amounts to more than aspiration and that moves beyond rhetoric. The Taoiseach mentioned a better Ireland. That is fantastic. We can all sign up for that. The issue is whether Government and the Office of An Taoiseach has the grit and the imagination to make that happen. As is often said, to make an omelette one has to break some eggs. To make Ireland better will require more than breaking eggs, it will require considerable effort and focus. In regard to the reference in the strategy to the need to devote time and resources to planning for the future, funding and reform of the health service, it is disappointing that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has indicated that he will, in a piecemeal way, adopt the report produced by the all-party Committee on the future of Healthcare. The crisis in the service is evident. The waiting lists are soaring, exhausted staff are fleeing the services in their droves, it seems and there is a lack of capacity in the Ambulance Service. The figures from the INMO reveal that in the first months of this year hospitals recorded the highest levels of overcrowding since record keeping commenced. I know that the Taoiseach can and will cite the exceptions but that is shocking. What does he, as Taoiseach, a former Minister for Health and a medical professional, propose to do about this?

The programme for Government includes an extensive section on health. It is my responsibility to work with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to ensure that it is implemented and that is exactly what I intend to do. In terms of the Sláintecare report, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has been tasked with providing a reasoned response to it. That should be done by September or October. Proper costings and due diligence need to be done. Having read the report, it seems to be silent or open on a funding model. It does not propose a particular new funding model. It just suggests that the health service should be funded from a number of sources, some of which it is already funded by. The Deputy mentioned the trolley numbers for the first six months of this year, which once again demonstrate the enormity and scale of the challenge ahead of us to turn our health service around and do that in a sustainable way. I had a very useful meeting with the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Secretary General of his Department last week, and we are going to try to develop some plans to turn things around. However, what is often interesting in these matters is not the exceptions but the stark contrasts in performance from hospital to hospital, to which the Deputy drew attention. These are figures produced by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation which show that, for example, in Beaumont Hospital the number of people on trolleys is at its lowest since records began. The same applies to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown and St. Vincent's Hospital has the second lowest number. We need to ask the fundamental question: why is there such an enormous variation in performance? One of the worst performing hospitals, for example, very disappointingly, is St. Luke's in Kilkenny, which has a new emergency department and many additional staff, yet Beaumont Hospital, which has had no extra beds or staff and is serving an ageing population, has had its best performance in ten years. Connolly Hospital, my local hospital, which is located in an area with a rapidly expanding population, has had the lowest trolley numbers since the nurses started counting them. That tells us a story about the health service. The constant solution that has been put forward is that it is all about putting more staff and more resources into the same system, but clearly that is only one part of the solution, because we see demonstrably that good management-----

How long does he believe that process will take in terms of the Cabinet committees and the restructuring of the Department? As the Taoiseach said, the current statement of strategy was published in February. It is interesting that it promised a full human resource analysis by the end of the following month. Four months on, can the Taoiseach tell us if this has been done and what actions, if any, have been implemented to make sure that there is enough staffing in critical roles within his Department? The outgoing strategy promised a full human resource analysis. It also lists six priority areas for the Department's work. Surprisingly one of them is not work concerning Northern Ireland. It is arguable, and we have argued that over the past six years, that the disengagement of
the Taoiseach, and his predecessor and Ministers, from Northern Ireland has been extremely damaging to the process. Certainly there have been concerns as to whether to the Taoiseach's office has the capacity any more to take the leadership role which previous taoisigh took in regard to the Good Friday Agreement. There was a point, for example, where the Northern division was a separate division in the Taoiseach's Department, it is now a section of a larger division which is dominated by Brexit and European Union matters. In terms of the new strategy, will the Taoiseach consider restoring the status and priority given to Northern Ireland in his Department? What measures does he propose to take to reverse the drift of recent years? It seems the template that is the Good Friday Agreement must remain the fundamental evolutionary framework for the three sets of relationship between Britain and Ireland, the North and the South and within both communities. I think there is an attempt by a number of forces and groups, by pushing other agendas, to undermine the essence of the Good Friday Agreement, which is the template to have proper parity of esteem between both communities in the North and the traditions and various issues that relate to those traditions.

There will be five Cabinet committees, lettered A, B, C, D and E, one covering broadly economic policy; one covering broadly public services and social policy, one dealing with Brexit and European affairs, one dealing principally with infrastructure and housing and a fifth one dealing principally with health. We are going to see how that works for six months and then make changes at that point if any need to be made. I had a chance to meet all the staff in the Department yesterday, albeit briefly but individually, to see what they do in their different areas. The Department of the Taoiseach is quite a small one and only 100 or so people work in it. People may imagine that the Department that co-ordinates matters and runs Government is much bigger than it really is. We will need to consider in the time ahead which areas need to be beefed up and perhaps Northern Ireland is one of those areas.  I very much agree with the Deputy that the Good Friday Agreement is and should remain the framework by which we manage relations in Northern Ireland, both North and South and east and west. It was agreed and passed in a referendum in this Republic by 97% of the people and in Northern Ireland by 71% of the people. It is not just a 50% plus one mandate, it is a set of relationships that have been agreed in both parts of the island by big majorities and by both communities. I do not believe there should be any significant change in the constitutional status or constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland unless there is a degree of support from both communities.

Will the new strategy statement acknowledge the disastrous failure of the housing strategy pursued during the past six years? That is not a rhetorical use of the word "disastrous". It is a self-evident fact that the strategy that has been pursued has failed to an extraordinary level. It has resulted in almost 3,000 people being homeless and 7,000 people in total, an enormous number, rotting on housing lists for close to two decades, in some cases, and there is no sign of any of this improving. It would be refreshing for anybody in politics and certainly for a Government to acknowledge a mistake, to say we got it wrong and that we need to radically shift focus and strategy in this area and, in particular, to recognise that the plan to lure in real estate investment trusts, vulture funds, property speculators and developers, through various incentives and tax breaks, has been an utter failure. I do not think we will ever grasp the extent to which it has been a failure in terms of the taxes forgone, but there can be little doubt of the enormous amount of money that has been made by those people. If we consider the results in terms of housing delivery, there was a 0.4% increase in the quantum of housing during those years and the situation has been disastrous in terms of housing and the homelessness. Will there be a recognition of that in the strategy statement and a consideration of a radical shift in strategy towards public provision of housing?

As there is a new Minister in the Custom House, there will also need to be a new strategy statement for the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. I imagine that will be the statement which will deal with and answer some of the questions the Deputy has raised. The Rebuilding Ireland strategy is Government policy. It is being implemented. As the Deputy will know, approximately 2,000 social houses are at various stages of construction or planning. That is a significant change compared to where were last year and we know that planning starts and planning applications have increased considerable as well. We are seeing definite increased activity in terms of housing supply, but we are still obviously very much further behind where we need to be in terms of supply. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is reviewing the strategy in full. Part of it, as the Deputy will know, involves an increase by one third in our social housing stock. Perhaps that is not enough but it is significant that we are going to increase our social housing stock by one third. It is a reversal of the policy in the past which was to reduce the social housing stock and sell it off. We are committed in the plan to increase it considerably but other measures need to be examined as well. There is a review of the first-time buyer's grant, of which the Deputy will be aware. Consideration is being given to a vacant homes strategy and taking action to tax homes that have been vacant for long periods of time in places of high demand, or also incentivising and encouraging people to make homes available for habitation.In the context of the budget, we will need to look at the private rented sector to see if there are ways we can encourage people to continue to rent their properties or move into the private rental market if they are not doing so already.

I spoke to President Trump by telephone last week. It was a short call, similar to a number of calls I have had in recent days. The President asked about Brexit and its impact on Ireland, as well as the peace process and the ongoing efforts to reinstate power-sharing in Northern Ireland. I outlined the current situation, including our particular concerns in relation to Brexit and acknowledged the importance of continued close interest and support in Northern Ireland affairs from the US Administration. While we did not discuss a possible visit to Ireland by the President, he reissued the invitation to me, as Taoiseach, to attend the traditional functions in Washington for St. Patrick’s Day, including meeting him in the White House. I look forward to attending these events next March. During our short conversation I raised a number of issues, including Ireland-US trade relations, migration, the scale of Irish investment in the United States and the importance of US foreign direct investment to Ireland and climate change. I indicated that I looked forward to having an opportunity to discuss these issues with him in more detail in due course. As I said in the House last week, I want to see our relations with the United States continue to develop based on the long-standing friendship between our two countries. As Taoiseach, I am committed to working productively with the US Administration to promote Ireland’s interests in the United States and further strengthen the economic, trade and investment links between Ireland and the United States to the mutual benefit of both countries. At the same time, I will ensure I promote the values of this country and the European values for which the Government stands.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	246	The core of this question was answered last week. We have been treated to the highly unusual situation where there is film of what was said at the other end of the line. As I said last week, we must have a large dose of realism when discussing what Ireland can achieve in bilateral discussions with powerful countries. Equally, it remains clear that President Trump's knowledge of Ireland remains roughly on a par with that when he was welcomed to a Sinn Féin fundraiser by Deputy Gerry Adams. On that occasion, a couple of months before the Canary Wharf bombing, Deputy Gerry Adams spoke admiringly of Mr. Trump, even saying Sinn Féin was happy to play "the Trump card." It has been reported that when the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, managed to persuade Deputy John Deasy to talk to the Taoiseach again, the Taoiseach offered him the role of special envoy to the US Congress. Will the Taoiseach explain what is involved in this highly unusual role? Does it supersede that of Ministers who are supposed to be undertaking this task as part of their role and the role of the ambassador to Washington who has always been the touch point in relationships with Congress and Capitol Hill? The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or one of his Ministers of State normally has explicit responsibility for lobbying on the issue of undocumented immigrants, for instance, among other issues. Did the Taoiseach discuss this appointment with them? Are there costs involved in the appointment? Will the Taoiseach explain, apart from being a consolation prize for Deputy John Deasy, what is actually involved and what the Deputy will be doing in the role?

I can confirm that he has not attended any Fine Gael fundraiser, to my knowledge.  I have appointed Deputy John Deasy as a Government envoy to the US Congress, particularly to deal with issues around migration and the undocumented Irish. It does not supersede anyone else's role. It does not supersede the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or that of the ambassador. Of course, I agreed to it with the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, prior to making the appointment. Deputy John Deasy will report to me, but he will work under the umbrella of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and with the new ambassador, Mr. Dan Mulhall, who will travel there in September. The particular role relates to the US Congress because it is important that we have a greater presence on Capitol Hill. The Deputy worked there for a long period, 15 years, and has good connections and a good knowledge of how the US Congress works. It will be of particular value having somebody there, in addition to our staff who are already in Washington DC, lobbying individual Members of Congress to have changes made to legislation that would be to our benefit.

I asked if he thought the election manifesto and policy promises of Donald Trump were racist and dangerous and he agreed that they were. I ask the Taoiseach the same question now that Donald Trump is President. Are the policies he is pursuing racist and dangerous? If the answer is yes, will the Taoiseach state this clearly and publicly and what it means for the stance we adopt vis-à-vis those policies and his Administration? The Taoiseach has said he does not agree with the travel ban. Is it racist to impose a travel ban on people from six particular countries, tarring all people from these countries who happen to be Muslims as somehow being undesirable to enter the United States? On the dangerous front, does the Taoiseach recognise that the policies being pursued by Donald Trump, particularly in the Middle East, of massively increasing arms sales to Saudi Arabia, supporting that brutal dictatorship and arming it to assist it in its vile actions in Yemen, the dangerous escalation of the conflict with Qatar which is also an escalation of the conflict with Iran, have dangerous implications for stability and peace in the region? Does the Taoiseach recognise that this is dangerous and that the President's talk at the the beginning of the year about sending an armada to North Korea was also a dangerous escalation? Notwithstanding the horrific nature of that regime and what it has done in the last few days, does the Taoiseach recognise that Donald Trump's policies are dangerous and racist and that something must be said about them?

Will he be supported by staff at our embassy in Washington or in the Taoiseach's Department? What will be his status in interactions? Will he speak authoritatively for the Government? How will it work and how will he co-ordinate his role with the formal role of our ambassador to Washington which we have always understood? Mr. Dan Mulhall who is about to take up the position is an extraordinarily experienced ambassador. Those of us who have been to Washington for decades will know the pivotal role played by our ambassador to Washington who has unique access to Capitol Hill. How will this be co-ordinated with somebody else? Is it envisaged that Deputy John Deasy will spend some part of the year in residence in Washington? My second question relates to the Taoiseach's conversation with President Trump.Did the Taoiseach and President Trump discuss his proposal for a border adjustment tax within the broader topic of free trade? Is there any indication that this proposal will be advanced by the Trump Administration?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	263	We did not speak about the border adjustment tax specifically. It was a short call and we sketched an agenda for a meeting that we will most likely have in March. I mentioned Ireland's commitment to free trade and the fact that we are a country that believes in and is committed to continuing free trade. I took the opportunity to mention to President Trump that Ireland is the seventh biggest inward investor into the United States. People often think it is all one way with US companies setting up in Ireland and employing staff. I mentioned there are over 700 Irish companies that have invested in the United States and are a big inward investor into that country. I indicated that Irish companies employ Americans in all 50 states. We need to start talking a little more about that and reminding people in the United States who may be opposed to free trade that it is a two-way process and they benefit from it as well. Deputy Deasy's appointment is an innovation and I am not sure if it has been done before in Ireland. It is not unusual in other countries for governments to appoint special representatives or special envoys.

We are all familiar with the concerns on this side of the Atlantic about many of the policies and strategies being pursued by the Trump Administration. Immigration has been mentioned and we could speak about the partisan White House approach to Israel. Climate change is also on the long list. I should also say that Sinn Féin, unlike other political parties, has considerable party engagement in the United States.

Has there been a follow-up call with the Trump Administration since the Taoiseach spoke with the President? I have a concern and it is important for families here and people in the United States to know whether the undocumented citizens are now under greater threat of arrest and deportation. I take this opportunity to express my personal admiration for Ms Caitriona Perry and her professionalism when she found herself the focus of President Trump's attentions. The Taoiseach spoke about envoys and it is not bad for an additional set of boots to be on the ground, as the Taoiseach put it, leading to additional engagement with Congress. The Trump Administration is the first since President Clinton not to appoint a special envoy to assist the peace process. Did the Taoiseach raise that matter with President Trump? When will our new ambassador take office? As the Taoiseach knows, Mr. Brian Burns recently withdrew his name from the process of becoming the next US ambassador to Ireland due to ill health. Is there a prospective US ambassador and did President Trump shed any light on the matter?

The embassy in Washington DC is in ongoing contact with members of the community and politicians in that city.

I spoke by phone with Prime Minister May on 27 June, when we discussed the ongoing talks process in Northern Ireland and our strong commitment to supporting the peace process as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement. We agreed to continue to work together to support the parties in reaching agreement to allow the re-establishment of the Northern Ireland Executive and the need to have all the institutions under the agreement up and running to ensure ongoing protection of the peace process. I reiterated the Irish Government's support of the Irish language Act and the need for balance and respect between the parties. I repeated my concern to ensure the UK Government's impartiality in Northern Ireland and noted the Conservative-DUP deal that had been published that day. I added that I hoped the additional funding for Northern Ireland would be beneficial and we briefly discussed the previous week's European Council. The British Prime Minister and I agreed to maintain close contact, including over the coming days, with reference to the Northern Ireland talks.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	293	The news from the talks in Belfast is very bad and it appears there will be at least another two months before the Executive might be re-established and the Assembly might start to work. The only details we have are the usual wholly partisan accounts from both Sinn Féin and the DUP that they have done nothing wrong and the other lot are being inflexible. Although there is an anti-Brexit majority in the Assembly and the DUP has lost the ability to table solo petitions of concern, Northern Ireland continues to be voiceless in Brexit discussions that are fundamental to the future welfare of all parts of this island. It is incredible that at a time of the worst potential threat to our economic model, there is no Executive or Assembly in Northern Ireland.Neither Government appears to be more than passive bystanders to these negotiations and certainly the active involvement critical to past agreements does not appear to be present. After two Assembly elections, a collapse of the Executive and an ongoing failure to re-establish the Executive, I believe that represents a crisis. It is a simple fact that the British Prime Minister has so far not attended any all-party discussions. She has been more even-handed than the Taoiseach at least in that she has met all of the parties, and not just the largest two. This is extremely damaging. I said it to the Taoiseach earlier and I agree with his comments that the Good Friday Agreement has to be restored as the central template through which these issues get resolved. The introduction of Border poll discussions and all of that-----

I refer to the absence of the North-South agenda. There was great momentum in the early days of the Agreement in terms of Waterways Ireland and all of that. I see no interest from the parties in that dimension to the Good Friday Agreement. I speak the Irish language and I have a great commitment to the language but we need to be careful that we do not exploit the Irish language as a tool in terms of political discussions. That could be damaging to the language. The Church of Ireland has a noble tradition in terms of scholarship around the Irish language. I remember being in negotiations in Hillsborough and going across to a Presbyterian chapel where there was a 16th century bible in Irish in a glass case. There was always a strong, healthy Protestant tradition in terms of the Irish language, so we need to be extremely careful that we do not now create alienation from the language in certain unionist and loyalist communities by having this as the breakpoint on which the Assembly cannot come back. I support an Act, although we have an Act here in the Republic and the first commissioner resigned because of its non-implementation.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	301	We are all worried about the imminent breakdown in the current talks in Northern Ireland that seems to put back the prospect, because of the impending marching season, of a reconstitution of the Executive until September at the earliest. That is profoundly worrying. Some months ago, the Taoiseach did an interview with Sean O'Rourke on his radio show during which he criticised the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, for talking in sound bites. He expressed his fears in that interview concerning her rhetoric on a border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. I am interested to hear the Taoiseach's views now because I believe we are at a critical phase. I share Deputy Micheál Martin's view, although the Taoiseach explained it was a time constraint when he was in the North that resulted in him only meeting with the DUP and Sinn Féin. Does he plan to rectify that by meeting the other parties - the SDLP, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the Green Party and so on soon - so that all parties are respected and embraced, including the UUP, in Northern Ireland? Some of us found the commentary by Sammy Wilson this morning on national radio jarring. I dealt with Sammy Wilson when he was Minister for Finance bilaterally on the North-South Council. If I was to paraphrase it, his commentary on any exhortation from the Republic for greater LGBT rights in Northern Ireland or marriage equality was that we are to butt out, and certainly the Taoiseach is to butt out. There are profound questions like that on which we have a right to have a view. I would be interested in hearing the Taoiseach's take on his commentary.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	302	I will begin by thanking the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Teachta Coveney, and the team of Government officials who participated in all of the discussions at Stormont Castle. I want to commend also our own negotiating team who have been immersed in this process for weeks and months and who for our part, to reassure the House, have kept channels of communication with every party and with Independents open. That is as it should be. It is a fair ask of the Taoiseach that he would also meet with the other parties, so I support that. The outcome of all of this is certainly not one we wanted. We are disappointed, but we are not deflected from the task at hand. It boils down to this. The DUP has adopted and seeks to defend an approach that is anti-equality. The issues at stake are issues of long standing. They are not orange or green. They are not Sinn Féin issues; they are civic issues. They are issues around equality before the law, in the case of marriage equality, or a bill of rights, as agreed at the time of the Good Friday Agreement. It is an issue around Acht na Gaeilge, for all Gaeilgeoirí. Their religious denomination does not matter. These are fundamental building blocks of identity, respect for diversity and, as I said earlier, equality before the law. The Taoiseach and the Government in Dublin not only have a right but an absolute responsibility to have a view and to pursue a progressive agenda on all of these matters. We need to get the institutions back in place. That is still the position. The DUP has its confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May.

People in Northern Ireland voted for devolved Government. They voted for home rule and because of the parties' inability to come to an agreement, that is not the case and they are being governed again by civil servants and British politicians. As well as that, there is no unique elected voice for Northern Ireland at a critical time in terms of Brexit. It is a shame that an agreement has not been made. Talks are now paused for the marching season and the summer break, but I hope and anticipate that talks can be successful in September when they resume. The Government has been very engaged. As the Deputies know, I met with the DUP and Sinn Féin. I am currently scheduling meetings with the other parties in the next couple of weeks. I am very keen to do that. They were invited to the official dinner last night but were not able to make it, so we are trying to find another time to have meetings in the next couple of weeks. I have had four engagements with Theresa May in person and on the phone. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been in Belfast for most of the past three weeks representing the Government. Both the Prime Minister and I as Taoiseach stand ready to take part in these talks. However, we agreed there was not a particular moment when such intervention would have made a key difference in the past. It has often been possible to bring the parties together with the help of funds from the guarantor Governments. The funds were made available this time by Theresa May through the agreement with the DUP, in addition to funds made available previously. The key problem as to why we do not have an agreement in the North is the inability of Sinn Féin and the DUP to trust each other. That is very unfortunate.

As we know, an independent impact analysis which Fianna Fail insisted on is under way. I would like the Minister to clarify when he intends to make a decision on the future of the scheme.

I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.

Following a competitive tender process, Indecon Economic Consultants was appointed in April to undertake the assessment. The purpose of the project is to assess whether the policy objectives on the supply of new homes are being met, the impact, if any, the scheme is having on new and second-hand house prices and on the residential property market generally. The report is being conducted on an independent basis. Indecon has devised a methodological approach which involves the use of data from the Revenue Commissioners and other sources, conducting interviews with key stakeholders and undertaking a full analysis of the policies surrounding the scheme. In direct answer to the Deputy's question, the report is scheduled to be completed by the end of August. Once received, its contents and findings will be considered and I will decide on any appropriate action or actions to take in the context of my deliberations as part of the annual budgetary process. The Government remains of the view that the help-to-buy incentive has the potential to increase the supply of new build homes, which is a crucial factor in addressing the problems facing the housing market generally. In that regard, it should be noted that a number of indicators point to a strengthening recovery in the housing market. For example, the latest Ulster Bank construction purchasing manager's index rose to a 15-month high in May and the index suggests housing activity has continued to expand every month since July 2013. I reassure members of the public who may be in the process of applying for the help-to-buy incentive, or those who have applications pending, that speculation concerning its abolition will not impact negatively on their applications. I will signal well in advance any proposed change to the incentive following my consideration of the Indecon report.

The Minister knows what our position is. The impact analysis should have been made in advance of the scheme being introduced. As it was not, we insisted on it being done immediately and it is now due to be completed by the end of August, as the Minister said. However, the position is that the speculation triggered by comments made by members of the Government has caused a huge amount of uncertainty in the property market. We have a situation where prospective first-time buyers are inevitably going to rush into the market at a time when there is a very small stock of new housing units available. This will inevitably lead to a spike in the prices of the very small number of new homes available. I want to know when the Minister is going to clarify the position to bring an end to the uncertainty. If he does have the report at the end of August, will he wait until budget time in mid-October to make an announcement, even if it is very clear from the independent report that the help-to-buy scheme is, in fact, pushing up prices?

The process is as I have outlined. If changes are due to be made to the scheme, I will signal them well in advance understanding the effect my words about the scheme might have on those who are considering using it or may already have applied. To aid the House in its consideration of the scheme, the Revenue Commissioners have shared figures with me regarding the performance of the scheme to date. It may be of interest to the Deputy and others that, in terms of the property values against which applications under the scheme have been made, just under 80% of the applications have been in respect of purchases of properties less than €375,000 and that approximately 60% of applicants have a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 85%. Therefore, there are people accessing the scheme for whom it is of help. I will be using the process I have outlined to the House and will signal well in advance changes due to be made.

What I interpret from his comments is that he is preparing the ground for the abolition of the help-to-buy scheme, but he will give notice to prospective buyers and the market of that course of action. This matters to people. There are first-time buyers who are wondering whether they should try to buy now and definitely avail of the scheme, or if they should wait until next year when they will have saved more money in order that they will have to borrow less in order to enter the property market and buy their first home. This impacts on real people and the life-changing decisions they have to make; it is important, therefore, to bring clarity to the situation. The speculation and uncertainty were directly caused by the Government's intervention in the first place and then by the comments made in which very strong hints were given. It has been widely written about by independent commentators, for example, Davy, all of whom are making the point that it seems that the scheme is about to be brought to an end.

The programme for Government states something different: "To make Ireland’s personal taxation system more competitive, we will ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the USC as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan". The Fine Gael manifesto states, "Completing the abolition of the USC over a 5-year period as part of a wider reform of the tax system that keeps the tax base broad and limits the benefits for the highest earners". There are clearly three contradictory positions. Will the Minister outline to the House which of them is his position?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	318	I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that our current system of personal taxation, including as it does three separate charges on income, through income tax, USC and PRSI, each with different income bases, reliefs and manners of assessment, is overly complex. It can be difficult for individuals to understand the personal tax system has the potential to lead to an increase in employment or, indeed, increases in the level of work undertaken by individuals. The programme for Government commitment to the phasing out of the USC was specified as part of a wider medium-term process of income tax reform, which would maintain the breadth of the tax base, while reducing excessive tax rates for middle income earners and limiting the benefits for high earners. We have made steady progress in reducing the personal tax burden in the three most recent budgets, with a particular focus on low to middle income-earners, and these reductions have been achieved primarily through cuts to the lowest three rates of USC. The top marginal rate of tax on income up to €70,044 has been reduced to 49%, and it must be remembered that, as recently as December 2014, the marginal rate of tax for a single individual on all income over €32,800 was 52%. My long-term view of the USC is to see its integration into the existing PRSI code. My focus on reducing the income tax burden for those on low and middle incomes should be the guiding principle. This must be achieved in a way that is both affordable and sustainable. In this regard, the end result is more important than the means of achieving this outcome. At this point in the process, I have an open mind as to the elements of the income tax system that could be employed as policy levers, to achieve the ultimate aim of the programme for Government with regard to reducing the tax burden faced by low and middle income earners.

Fine Gael wanted to go the full hog and abolish 100%, which would erode more than €4 billion of our tax base. By 2021, with no policy changes, this tax would bring in €5.2 billion per year. At least now we seem to be hearing that a substantial portion of it, if not all of it, will be retained but will be renamed or remodelled into the PRSI. Something that is not very clear is the Minister said the Department will carry out another assessment. An assessment was done last year on how the Government could abolish the USC over a period of time. Will the Minister state categorically the USC tax base, on which the State depended on until now, will not be eroded in the way presented by the Government and by Fine Gael, which showed abolishing the USC would cost the State up to €4 billion?

What is the current position of the Minister for Finance? Is it the position in the Government manifesto? Is it the position of the Taoiseach?

This has happened. I have outlined to the Deputy my view and the Taoiseach's view on the long-term role of the universal social charge. It should be at the heart of a new social contract between our citizens, through how we integrate it into the PRSI code.

The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF, has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims. As the judgment has been delivered, it is now possible to begin the process of making payments in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act 1964, as amended. Payments can only be made from the ICF with the approval of the High Court, and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF. If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65%, or €825,000, whichever is the lesser, due to relevant third party claimants. The liquidator has confirmed to the Department that, as of 20 June 2017, the number of open claims is 1,578. The Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and the State Claims Agency are working with the liquidator to progress the making of payments to these claimants.In this regard, there are currently 324 claims ready for settlement and which have been validated by the State Claims Agency. The process for bringing these claims to the High Court for approval has commenced but a date has yet to be agreed. Over and above the 65% ICF, insurance compensation fund, payment, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of money due to third party claimants will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta’s assets on completion of the liquidation process. However, it is not possible to say definitively at this stage what proportion of the claims this will amount to. Current indications are that this is unlikely to be sufficient to cover the entire 35% gap, however.

Those involved have had their lives put on hold due to accidents, some of which happened well before the liquidation of Setanta in 2014. Some involve serious injuries and the Minister of State knows of one particular case in which fatalities were involved. There are court awards of which not one cent has yet been paid. This is fundamentally unfair. We need to hear something new from the Minister of State. I have not even heard him or the Government say that it is their objective that these people will get 100% of their claims met. We know 65% of claims will be met from the ICF, while the liquidation process will deliver some surplus, perhaps meeting up to 30% of claims. Will the Minister of State meet with the insurance industry to agree a way of ensuring the claimants involved will get 100% of their claims met?

The legislation is clear that within six months they will receive 65% of their payment from the ICF. The issue is the shortfall following this ICF payment. We do not know what amount will be gathered from the liquidation process. The State simply cannot intervene at this stage. We are awaiting an up-to-date actuarial process on the information involved. The information we are operating on at the moment dates back to 2014. When we get the actuarial information, we will see exactly how much of the 35% shortfall it may involve. The State is not committing to or against anything. We will review it and see what the shortfall will be. However, we do not know what it is and we cannot commit to an open-ended shortfall at this moment.

We know the ICF will pick up 65% of the bill. Will the Minister of State ask the insurance industry if it has any proposals to resolve the situation and also seek an update from the liquidation process? The Minister of State spoke about the Towers Watson actuarial report which goes back to 2014. We were told that up to 30% of the outstanding claims may be met. If 65% comes from the ICF and up to 30% from the liquidation process, then the shortfall will be modest. It will be a stain on the industry if these people do not get 100% of their claims met. I want to hear from the Minister of State today that it is the Government's objective to work with all the stakeholders involved, namely the liquidator, the insurance compensation fund and the industry, to ensure the people caught up in this mess will not ultimately be out of pocket as a result.

However, the information we have is clear. If the Government attempts to step into the conversation at this stage, potentially the liquidator could reduce the amounts it will make available to claimants. The Government would then subsequently have to pick up a further amount. I would not like that to happen. We will see what the amount is when the new actuarial process has concluded. We have given a commitment that we will review the matter and do the best we can for those caught up in this. There are over 1,500 cases. Of these, 324 will move quickly over the next couple of months. That is the start of the process. The Government could not do anything until the Supreme Court case was over. It is now over and we are keeping matters under review.

Will he seek an extension of the time period in which the debt must be repaid in view of the fact that it is unfair to ask this generation to shoulder the burden?

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	349	I presume the Deputy is referring to EU-IMF programme-related debt when he asks about renegotiation. This debt accounts for about one quarter of Ireland’s total debt. My Department, in conjunction with the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, is constantly looking to avail of any appropriate opportunity for savings on the cost of our EU-IMF programme loans and the matter is constantly reviewed. Our debt-to-national income ratio has declined significantly in recent years. However, I recognise the limitations of using GDP, gross domestic product, as a proxy for our national income. For a more meaningful assessment of trends in public debt in Ireland, it is important to look beyond this simple measure. While other debt sustainability measures such as the debt-to-revenue ratio and the interest-to-revenue ratio are also improving, they clearly demonstrate that our debt level is high by international standards. Accordingly, reducing it must remain a priority. Our economy is growing strongly. Our public finance deficit is declining, as are our debt service costs. We are now running a primary budget surplus. All of this is positive from a debt sustainability perspective. In addition, the proceeds from the recent sale of part of the Government’s shareholding in AIB will reduce the overall level of public debt. As regards seeking renegotiation as suggested by the Deputy, he should be aware that significant improvements to the terms of our EU-IMF programme loans have already been secured since they were initially agreed in late 2010. There have been two separate maturity extensions granted to loans from the EFSM, European financial stabilisation mechanism, and the EFSF, European financial stability facility. These extensions mean that the next EFSF maturity is not until 2029, while it is not expected that Ireland will have to refinance any of its EFSM loans before 2027. All of this has delivered significant savings for this and future generations.

Last year, Greece paid €8 billion to service debts of €350 billion, while Ireland paid €7.5 billion to service debts of €214 billion. Why did it cost us almost as much as Greece to service €100 billion less? Middle-income earners cannot continue paying 51% or 52% tax. Services have been cut, including those for people with disabilities. Even death grants are not to be had anymore. The European Central Bank lent the money at 0.5% and then started off demanding 5% and 5.5% interest to get the money back. Irish people have paid for 42% of the European banking crisis. Average banking debt across the EU is €192 per person. In Ireland, it is €9,000 per person. The next highest country is Germany at €491 and then Latvia at €317.

It is involved in reducing spending on public services and investment, as well as changing public pensions.We have all that behind us. We have made those changes. We are out of a bailout programme and we are now in a position in which we are able to fund our own debt on a day-to-day basis. We are seeking to pay back money we secured in a bailout programme. The Deputy asked me what changes were made to make our debt more sustainable. We made changes in regard to the interest rates in terms of how we accessed funding from the European Union and other countries. Those savings were worth over €9 billion over the original seven and a half years of the loans. We made decisions to extend the maturities or the length of time over which we would pay back debt to European institutions. This removed the need for the State to refinance nearly €20 billion worth of debt between 2015 and 2022. We made a decision to repay over four fifths of our IMF loans, which will deliver interest savings of over €1.5 billion. We are securing the kind of change the Deputy is seeking. The difference between Ireland and Greece is as I have tried to outline to him.

We do not have oil wells or gold mines. It is the working people who are paying this debt. It was not the working people or the people of Ireland who caused the problem; it was the bondholders and the bankers. I ask the Minister to tell the ECB bankers that we will pay. Irish people have always paid their way. We cannot pay until we have the money, however, and there is too much pressure on the current generation given what they are suffering at present. Germany should understand this well because it did not finish paying its First World War debt until three or four years ago. We still need to do better and the Government, including the Minister, needs to do better in this regard. The economic recovery has not gone far beyond the Red Cow.

Being in a position where our national debt grows in an unsustainable way is a threat not only to future generations but also to the current one. On the Deputy's question regarding the time over which we are paying back our debt, the proportion of our debt that is maturing for longer than five years is approximately 30%. The proportion in Belgium is 40%, the proportion in France is 50%, and that in Italy is also 50%. Therefore, we are seeking to pay back our debt over a longer period. Balancing our books is the most significant day-to-day contribution we can make to stabilise the debt and continue to reduce it.

This involves the transfer of valuable rights attaching to shares in a company to shares owned by its members. I ask the Minister to put a stop to this once and for all by bringing in legislation before the recess to make sure this scam cannot continue.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	355	I assume the Deputy is referring to a recent Circuit Court decision regarding the tax treatment of the transfer of share rights from a company to its shareholders. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that section 130(3)(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that the transfer of an asset by a company to its members constitutes a distribution for tax purposes. In regard to the case in question, the view of the Revenue Commissioners is that the transfer of rights attaching to shares owned by a company to shares owned by its members amounts to a transfer of an asset and, as such, is a distribution pursuant to section 130(3)(a). Both the appeal commissioner and the Circuit Court have ruled in favour of the Revenue Commissioners and determined that the transfer of share rights is chargeable to income tax as a distribution in the way I have outlined. It is, therefore, considered by the Revenue Commissioners that the current legislation operates as intended and is sufficiently robust to provide for distribution treatment on such share rights transfers. The Revenue Commissioners will continue to challenge taxpayers who attempt to extract cash from companies in a tax-free manner. The Revenue Commissioners carry out a robust programme of compliance interventions to minimise the burden on the compliant taxpayer and tackle the non-compliant taxpayer. This involves taking account of all risks that apply to a taxpayer across all taxes and duties. The role of the Revenue Commissioners is to recover any unpaid tax or duty along with interest and penalties. The anti-avoidance units of the Revenue Commissioners specifically deal with the identification and challenging of aggressive tax-avoidance schemes in the way I have outlined.

My question relates to the future. We understand that this matter has been before the courts. The Circuit Court has found in favour of the Revenue Commissioners but we are aware that there is an appeal pending. We obviously cannot interfere with what happens in the courts but what happens in the future is not a matter for the courts; it is a matter for the Government. It is the responsibility of the Government to introduce legislation to ensure this loophole is closed, and closed for all time. I asked the Minister to do that again. It is important to remember that the individuals involved are household names. They are very wealthy and powerful and are part of a group with significant financial assets, amounting to €37 billion more than at peak-boom levels. They have done very well out of the recession and the recovery. There is no doubt they have used their position in this regard effectively to be part of a scam against the State and the public generally.

Look at what happened. The Revenue Commissioners became aware of a matter and issued amended tax assessments in regard to it. A challenge was brought to the appeals commissioner and the Revenue Commissioners won. They were then brought to the Circuit Court, where they also won. There was a further appeal. That appeal was heard and the Revenue Commissioners won. Therefore, at each stage of this process when the Revenue Commissioners became aware of this issue and took action thereon, on which action it has been challenged, the law they have used and the way in which they have acted have been upheld. For those reasons, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that no change to the law is needed as its position is being upheld. As the Deputy will be aware, in the Finance Acts 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, action was taken on the advice of the Revenue Commissioners and others to deal with the issue of tax avoidance.

It is a matter for the Government to ensure that the activity in question is precluded in the future. The Minister referred to budgets in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Issues arose in those budgets since the profits of banks are now not taxable until 2047. The question of the taxing of vulture funds was addressed in those budgets. This matter needs to be tackled urgently. It needs to be dealt with through legislation and this should be done before the recess.

The law and the way the Revenue Commissioners are acting are being upheld by the recent rulings in the way that I have described to the Deputy. Since 2014, a number of taxpayers have settled their cases with the Revenue Commissioners in the particular area that Deputy Healy referred to. The yield to the Revenue Commissioners from those cases in tax, interest and penalties was €11.8 million. If at any point I am advised by the Revenue Commissioner on this or on any other matter that further legislation or a change in legislation is needed, of course I will consider it and bring it to the Oireachtas at the first possible opportunity. As the Deputy acknowledged himself in his question to me, the stance of the Revenue Commissioners has actually been upheld by each of the hearings the Deputy referred to.

I put it to the Minister that the reason for this is because of the extent of precarious work, low-paid work and, something that has not been mentioned enough in this regard, bogus self-employment, particularly in the construction industry.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	361	I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 60 together. Given overall tax performance, I assume the Deputy is referring to income tax, which has performed steadily in the first six months of 2017.  It is up 3.1% or €274 million on the same period last year. However, income tax receipts of €9,045 million, or just over €9 billion, were slightly behind profile, down 2.3% or €214 million. Those are the year-to-date figures. This shortfall against target is across a range of income tax components.   Income tax encompasses a broad range of elements, some of which are not directly impacted by employment or wage developments. Some of these components are having a drag on overall income tax receipts in the first half of this year.  The key component, PAYE income tax, which accounts for around 65% of total income tax receipts, was broadly in line with profile at the end of June. It is down 0.8%, which is €51 million.  This indicates an annual growth of 7.7%, or €462 million, versus a year ago.      Notwithstanding this, the performance of USC was lower than originally expected at the end of June, with receipts down 4.8%, or €83 million below target, and officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have been looking into this.  As part of my review, my Department and Revenue have re-examined the budget 2017 USC costings and we are satisfied that they are as accurate as possible given the complexities involved in forecasting.  Furthermore, as part of the continuous efforts to improve the Department's tax forecasting performance, the ESRI and my Department jointly examined the sensitivity of income tax and USC revenues to changes in income. As a result of this work, which was published in March of this year, the Department has revised the income tax and USC revenue elasticities used in the forecasting process. These new elasticities were and will be used in the forecasts for 2018 and subsequent years in the 2017 stability programme update, which is published in April.   However, it should be noted that a back-casting using the revised elasticities would obviously imply a lower USC forecast for this year.

I particularly want to concentrate on the issue of precarious working conditions and, specifically bogus self-employment. There are now approximately 140,000 people working in construction. There is talk about how construction work is gathering momentum. I got another call in a series of phone calls I have had over recent years from building workers about the regeneration of Dolphin House and Fatima Mansions. Purcell Construction is the main developer down there. Rapid Developments is the bricklaying subcontractor. This is a firm that has had a lot of State contracts. It built St. Patrick's College in Maynooth and there were similar issues there. It is very similar to Rhatigans in that it has men taken on seven or eight weeks beforehand who are employed on PAYE but have not heard a word from Revenue. When they telephone Revenue to ask if they are in the system, Revenue states that it has not heard a thing about it. This is still rampant in the construction sector. If it was done properly and if they were on PAYE, the State would be getting very significant extra income tax revenues.

In particular, in June we saw a number of the tax heads that are particularly important in paying for our public services this year post a better performance. With regard to the specific matters and companies the Deputy has raised with me, I am sure that the Revenue Commissioners get back promptly to queries that are raised with them. I am sure that upon the Deputy raising these points in the Dáil, these matters will gain further public attention. We have bodies whose job it is to enforce employment standards in construction and elsewhere. To answer the Deputy's question very broadly, if we look at the number of people who are classified as part-time and under employment, that has actually fallen by 6.4% in the first three months of this year. We are seeing increases in employment across the economy and increases in average earnings per hour and per week in all of the figures that we have available for 2017. The CSO is indicating a different overall picture to what the Deputy is indicating.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	364	There are 220,000 to 230,000 people who are classified as self-employed with no paid employees. I put it to the Minister, as construction workers and others in this House have been putting it to him for a long time, that the reason for that, particularly in construction, is bogus self-employment. One of the workers I mentioned is a labourer. When he telephoned Revenue to ask if he was down on the PAYE system, because his employer said he was taken on as a PAYE worker, he was told that he had probably been classified as self-employed. He is a labourer. How could he be self-employed? It is ridiculous. This is rampant in construction. From a tax point of view, if we look at 2008, for example, when there were 126,000 self-employed relevant contracts tax, RCT, workers, there was a minus figure in tax revenue of €67 million. This tax head loses money in many cases or gives no tax revenue compared to similar numbers of PAYE workers who brought in €700 million in tax revenue in that year. Is the same thing going on now? Is the Minister looking into it seriously to investigate these kinds of abuses?

However, I will be meeting them directly in the coming days and will raise the matter with them to see if there is a cause for concern in the way the Deputy has outlined. As we know, the Revenue Commissioners impartially implement all the laws that we have around taxation. Alongside the Deputy's view regarding that issue, on which I will come back to the Deputy when I raise it with the Revenue Commissioners, let us also acknowledge that we are now at a point at which we have more than 2 million people back at work within our economy. I made the point to the Deputy earlier that if we look at all of the figures that are available from the CSO for 2017, they show an increase in earnings by week and by hour versus where we were a year ago.It has shown that those increases are broad-based and that if one looks at the 13 sectors in our economy, one will see that earnings per hour have increased in nine of those sectors and earnings per week have increased in 11. It is a matter that I will raise directly with the Revenue Commissioners and if there is a point of concern on it, I will revert to Deputy Boyd Barrett.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	367	I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 53 together. A real estate investment trust or REIT is a quoted company used as a collective investment vehicle to hold rental property. A REIT is exempt from corporation tax on qualifying income and gains from rental property subject to a high profit distribution requirement. A REIT provides the same after-tax returns to investors as direct investment in rental property by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply. In the Finance Act 2016, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, introduced measures to address concerns about the use of certain vehicles by non-resident investors in the Irish property market. Section 22 of the Finance Act 2016, which amended section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, was introduced to address concerns about the use of the section 110 regime by non-resident investors for the distressed debt that they had purchased from financial institutions. In response to concerns that section 110 was being used to erode the State's taxing rights on Irish property, the Finance Act 2016 restricted the use of the section 110 regime to remove the ability of section 110 companies to use what are known as profit participating notes to extract Irish property or distressed debt profits out of the company in a way that ensured little or no Irish tax liability arises. The Finance Act 2016 also introduced a new regime for the taxation of Irish funds holding Irish real estate known as the Irish real estate fund or IREF. The legislation was introduced to address concerns raised regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by non-resident investors to invest in Irish property. IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on certain property distributions to non-resident investors.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House. 
 I am of the view that the taxation regimes remain appropriate for these entities. As the REIT regime is designed to prevent a double layer of taxation and the amendments in the Finance Act 2016 were designed to protect the State's taxing rights over property, these are not favourable tax regimes nor is there an evidential link between these tax regimes and property supply issues.

To this day, the Government cannot even tell us how much tax has been forgone via section 110 and will still be forgone in terms of capital gains and rental income under these schemes. Incredibly, ISIF is working with these people who have sucked vast amounts of profits out of the country. What has it delivered in terms of housing? It has delivered nothing. In all of the years in which these things have been in operation, according to the CSO, we have had a 0.4% increase in housing stock and, of course, a disastrous situation in social housing. Can the Minister tell us how many billions we have wasted in forgone tax revenue to get that failed result in terms of a thoroughly dysfunctional housing sector, which is dysfunctional precisely because the Government gave them tax breaks instead of using the State's resources to invest in social housing?

If an individual or company resident or non-resident makes a gain on the disposal of Irish property, it is standard practice for them to pay capital gains tax at 33%. If an individual resident or non-resident has Irish rental income, they pay Irish personal tax. Likewise, companies, both resident and non-resident, pay corporation tax at 25% on their rental income with dividend withholding tax applied for non-residents. The big question is why the Government throws out the rule book when it comes to these funds. What is happening in this State is ridiculous. This State is being bought up inch by inch and foot by foot by these multinational, large investment and multi-billion euro funds and they are doing so under the noses of the Irish authorities. Inserted into the tax code is a provision stating that they must pay a minimum amount of tax. There is a number of elements to this. We are dealing with REITs, Irish collective asset-management vehicles or ICAVs and qualifying investor alternative investment funds or QIAIFs- each with a different tax structure. Let us look at 2015. The accounts of the three REITs in this State all recorded a profit of €238 million. How much did they pay in tax? They paid €5.27 million. The Minister's internal documents, which I obtained through freedom of information, show that the capital gains tax exemption for the qualifying investor funds is clogging up the housing market. It is more profitable for these funds to leave their apartments empty and their lands undeveloped and to hold them for five years than actually to sell or develop them and get tenants into those properties. That is because of the Government's policy.

That is a matter for the company. What I will comment on is the overall tax treatment of REITs and similar entities. What neither Deputy pointed out in their analysis of the issue is the fact that because of how they are structured, REITs are required to return 85% of their yield or profit to investors. Look at how investors are taxed. If an Irish investor resident here is an individual, they pay income tax on that and if the investor is a corporation, it pays a rate of 25% on it. An institutional portfolio investor pays a rate of tax on it of 12.5%. In respect of an investor outside our jurisdiction, there is a tax code relating to payment abroad, which means the investor will pay tax on that of between 15% and 20%. As both Deputies know, the reason these REITs were put together was to avoid being in a situation where any form of economic activity is taxed twice but as neither Deputy pointed out in their analyses, those taxation regimes apply to the income that comes from the REIT and there is a different taxation regime for an Irish investor compared to an investor abroad. In addition to a tax rate of between 15% and 20%, an investor abroad is required to declare their income in the jurisdiction in which they are resident and pay tax on that as well.

I know a working group is examining the taxation of rental income by various recipients. Could the Minister clarify whether this working group will report by the end of July, as envisaged, and whether it will feed into budgetary considerations for October? I acknowledge that the overarching issue is one of supply and that this is what underpins all of this. In respect of the various ways in which rental income is taxed - for an individual private landlord, it is up to 55% at the marginal rate, while for companies, it is 25%, plus a further 20% where there is a close company surcharge - while I can understand some of the logic behind incentivising professional institutional landlords, if the Minister is trying to encourage private individuals to purchase one-off houses in estates here and there, they simply will not do so. When will the report be completed and will it feed into budgetary considerations prior to October?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	373	The Minister appears to tell us about the changes to section 110 and the fact that some of the investors will actually pay some tax, but he is ignoring the fact that the REITs, provided they share 85% of the dividends with their investors, pay no tax on their rental income, nor do they pay any capital gains tax if they stay for at least five years. In January 2014 I challenged the then Minister for Finance on the fact that these organisations and entities were going to cause serious problems in the rental market. He said they only held €400 million worth of assets and that we should worry about them when they got bigger. Now they hold billions of euro worth of assets and we do not yet seem to be worrying about them. The truth of the matter is that they have seriously unbalanced the rental market. They are about to launch a scheme of apartments on the south side and are looking for €1,900 a month or more for one-bedroom apartments. It has gone off the Richter scale and the Minister is not controlling them. He has ignored his responsibility in that regard.

I will abide by that principle in any comment I make on the taxation of rental income in the future, apart from confirming for the Deputy that there is a report on the way on all tax support in the rental market. I expect it to be available to me either before or during the summer. I am discussing the matter with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. On what the Deputy said, I make the point that in the analysis offered on REITs to date on the floor of the House the indication is that there is no tax involved in any way. The funds were set up in such a way that they required 85% of the profit is returned to the investor. The investor pays tax. Furthermore, there is a dividend withholding tax, something I did not hear either Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett or Deputy Pearse Doherty acknowledge.

I ask him to tell us, although I know that he will not, how much tax has been forgone as a result of section 110 and the REIT tax breaks. We can never get an answer to that question. They are still benefiting from them and, as we know, they just sat on properties and jacked up rents, worsening the housing crisis. I even logged onto PricewaterhouseCoopers' website today to see what it had to say about section 110. It is boasting, stating one should invest here because one would not have to pay any tax. "Tax neutral" is the wording used and what is being touted by these accountancy firms. They state people should get involved in the property market in Ireland because one would not have to pay any tax, there will be flexible and favourable domestic tax law reliefs and that Ireland allows for neutral treatment of corporation tax, provided certain conditions are met, blah, blah, blah. The Minister shows no interest in looking at this scandal, given what has been done to the property market.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	379	The Minister needs to open his eyes and look at what is happening. Let us look at what the Central Statistics Office, CSO, stated. It stated non-household buyers were outstripping new homeowners in purchases of new houses in Dublin. Who makes up the largest component of non-household buyers? The answer is REITs qualified investor funds. Some 62% of new homes in Dublin were bought by those involved in that component and 44% nationally. They are outbidding families that are trying to get onto the property ladder because of the tax structure. The Minister gave a nice answer, that 85% of income had to be distributed to shareholders, but what he did not tell the House was that 85% of the investment in REITs was foreign. Therefore, there is no capital gains tax to be gained on the uplift of property values. That is why, of the profit of €238 million recorded by the three REITs in their accounts, they paid just over €5 million in tax to the State. The other thing the Minister dodged was the fact that officials in the Department of Finance and Revenue stated there were genuine, valid concerns and that the policy the Minister introduced was clogging up the market because it was more profitable for qualified investment funds or Irish Real Estate Funds, IREFs, to hold on to properties, leave them empty, not sell them or hold on to land because they could avail of the five-year rule, under which there would be no capital gains tax if they held on to property for five years. As the Minister's own officials are telling him this, he needs to step up and change the law to deal with a number of issues. He needs to give commitments in that regard because this is having a detrimental effect on renters and those trying to get into the property market.

REITs, in particular, play a role in the release of commercial property which we also need. I have clearly outlined how income generated from REITs is taxed. It is taxed in different ways, depending on where one is resident. There is also the dividend withholding tax which has not been acknowledged by any Deputy who has criticised what I have said, but, of course, it is always the case.

I have some questions about the process involved. When did this matter first arise? Will the Minister outline the advice his Department and NAMA received on the decision? Was the Comptroller and Auditor General engaged at all times in decision-making? If legal advice was sought from the Attorney General, is the Minister satisfied that the decision is not in breach of section 57(1) of the National Asset Management Act 2009 regarding the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	390	The pending implementation of the 2014 revised EU audit directive and regulations which underpin the Deputy’s question was first brought to the attention of my officials in the Department of Finance in respect of the potential impact for NAMA in May 2016 by officials within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who are responsible for transposing the directive into Irish law.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation made contact with my Department and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the implementation of statutory audit obligations in the 2014 revised EU audit directive and regulations prior to their transposition into Irish law via Statutory Instrument 312 of 2016 and the Companies Act 2014. My Department engaged over a number of months with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and NAMA on this matter.  My Department also sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the directive which requires that certain companies, including NAMA, be audited by a statutory auditor within the meaning of the directive.This audit requirement is separate from and in addition to the audit requirements set out in the NAMA Act which remain in effect. It was also confirmed that the Comptroller and Auditor General was not a statutory auditor within the meaning of the directive. I understand both NAMA and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General obtained separate legal advice which concurred with this position. Hence, the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit of the statutory financial statements of the NAMA group of entities from the financial year ending on 31 December 2016 onwards does not fulfil the requirements of the directive. I am advised that the Comptroller and Auditor General believes that, at a minimum, a change in legislation will be required in order for him to become a statutory auditor. In that regard, cognisance would also need to be taken of the particular features of the Constitution which safeguard the independence of the role.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	391	According to the NAMA Act, the overall objective of NAMA was to bring stability to the banking system by removing impaired loans from bank balance sheets; it was never set up to make a profit. It would have to get back over €74 billion to make a profit. The Minister is saying the EU directive requires that certain companies, including NAMA, must be audited by a statutory auditor within the meaning of the directive. The NAMA Act states the Comptroller and Auditor General is the statutory auditor and I take it we are allowing the Act to be overruled by the directive. The directive's requirements relate to certain companies, including NAMA. Obviously, it does not explicitly name NAMA. I am assuming, therefore, that the Department believes NAMA falls under the public interest entity provisions of the directive. A public interest entity, essentially, is a listed company which must trade on the EU stock market and is deemed to have public importance by an EU member state. Will the Minister tell me the exact methodology used in interpreting that NAMA falls within the description of a public interest entity? I am aware that NAMA may have bonds trading, but it is stretching it in defining it as a listed company on the stock market.

To answer the main question he asked, it arises from a change to the audit requirements. Because the audit requirements emanated from an EU directive, we had to change how we were dealing with these matters. All of the bodies affected, including NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General, worked together to deal with the matter. We will now be in a situation where the Comptroller and Auditor General will continue to fulfil his role, but we will also have a statutory auditor in Mazars which will performing its own functions.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	393	Speaking of Mazars, this morning Professor Richard Murphy of University College London called for greater regulation of the big four accountancy firms because of their ongoing facilitation of tax avoidance. We all know the names of the four firms: Deloitte, PwC, Ernst & Young and KPMG. Mazars is probably No. 5. The goal of the European Union with the directive was to reinforce the independence of auditors and there is probably no one more independent than the Comptroller and Auditor General. I argue - I think the Minister would not disagree with me - the Comptroller and Auditor General is more independent than any of the big five, including Mazars. Article 14 of the EU directive which deals with statutory auditors states, "In exceptional circumstances, Member States may derogate from the requirements laid down in this Article ...". NAMA has always been an exception, dating back to 2009 when the European Commission gave it a special exemption to receive state aid. Will the Minister tell us whether his Department sought an exemption from the European Union because of exceptional circumstances and, if not, why not?

If I am wrong in that understanding, I will respond to the Deputy with the information. There has been no change in the recognition of the constitutional role of the Comptroller and Auditor General as auditor of the State. It has not been affected. The Deputy asked my view on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The work he does is of the highest quality. As a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I have seen him in action. He will continue with his work on NAMA or any other body with which he has a relationship, but because of a change in the EU directive, in the way I outlined to the Deputy, it was necessary to appoint a further body, in this case, Mazars, to meet our obligations under law in relation to NAMA. There is no conflict in the matter. All of the parties affected co-operated in the change. As I said, if my understanding is wrong in relation to the exemption, I will revert to the Deputy and inform him of such.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	396	As the Deputy will be aware, the State has now sold 25% of AIB's ordinary share capital at a price of €4.40 per share for a consideration of almost €3 billion. The offering was strongly supported by a broad range of international institutional investors, with all of the top investors being categorised as longer term investors and sovereign wealth funds. The State also granted an additional over-allotment option to its appointed stabilisation agent Deutsche Bank, covering a further 3.75% of AIB's ordinary share capital as part of the transaction. Hence, unless some of the shares are bought back in the market in the period post-floatation, the State will recoup a further €400 million, bringing the total proceeds from the IPO to €3.4 billion. Following the AIB IPO, the State's remaining shareholding in the bank is in a lock-up period of 180 days. This is standard market practice. I, therefore, expect no further sale of AIB shares in 2017. After this period elapses, officials in my Department will revert to monitoring the performance of the bank, its share price and equity markets more generally to determine the next sensible opportunity to realise and gain value from our investment. It is important to point out that exiting our full investment in AIB in a measured way that will maximise the gain will take a number of years, but I believe that in time we will recoup all of the money we invested in the bank. Under A Programme for a Partnership Government, any future sale of AIB shares contemplated before the end of 2018 would need to be approved by the Government.  Similarly, my officials and I continue to monitor the performance of Permanent TSB and Bank of Ireland and plan for exit opportunities that may arise in the future. However, having just completed a large equity capital markets transaction with the shares in AIB, I have no immediate plans to sell any of the State's shares in either of these banks at this time.

I note the AIB shares are trading at €5.09 and that investors are doing well so far, but, of course, it is early days. I understand the proceeds of the sale will be received by the Ireland Strategy Investment Fund and that, under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, the Minister has the power to instruct the fund to make payments to the Exchequer. Will he confirm if it is the intention of the Government to issue such an instruction to the ISIF to transfer funds to the Exchequer and clarify that it is his intention to use them to reduce the Exchequer's borrowing requirement? Will the Minister also provide clarification on the use of future proceeds? He laid out the Government's position on the proceeds of the sale of the stake in AIB, but has the Government raised any issue with the European authorities, namely, the European Commission, about the future use of proceeds of the sale of other bank-related assets?

It owns the vast majority of the bank and as the share price goes up, our stake in the bank also goes up. To answer the Deputy's second question, it continues to be my intention to use the money to repay the national debt.The €3 billion relating to the 25% of sales was released back to the Exchequer last Tuesday or Wednesday. We will be using it to pay down the national debt in a way that meets our requirements under EU law. The future sale of bank shares is not on my immediate agenda as I outlined in my first reply to Deputy McGrath. I have not, as of yet, raised it with the European Commission or elsewhere. However, I expect there will be ongoing debate throughout the next one or two years in respect of the future role of fiscal rules within the eurozone.

The fact is that AIB is now resuming dividend payments. It is our view that, in the absence of any negotiations with the European Commission to secure greater flexibility for the State on how any future proceeds might be used, the State should not proceed with any further sale of shares. I am simply setting out our position. We believe there is need for greater flexibility on the use of such one-off proceeds, especially in the area of investment. There is significant consensus across the House in favour of using proceeds in the future for that purpose. That is our position. I take it from what the Minister has said that he is going to issue the instruction to the NTMA strategic investment fund under the Act to transfer the €3 billion or so into the Exchequer balance.

There is essentially a political problem in the sense that expectations are building up with such flattering net figures. People want to see schools being built and hospitals being built and refurbished. Many old machines in hospitals have now run their life's course having been bought before the beginning of the collapse. We cannot blame people for having these expectations. However, we should be careful what we say to people. The Minister may form his own view in due course but his predecessor in particular held firmly to the view that the release of extra capital investment would overheat the economy. Given our growing population and poor infrastructure, we desperately need additional investment in various areas, especially in areas of public transport and carbon saving. Has the Minister reconsidered, or has he had a chance to reconsider, the position in that regard?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	401	Yesterday, my Department was clear and careful not to use the proceeds of the sale in the AIB share to influence the half-year figures for income and expenditure. The changes in our position overall were mostly driven by the improvement in tax collection, especially throughout June. We did not use the sale of the AIB share to influence the presentation of those figures, but of course it did have a big effect on the surplus that we delivered at this point in the year versus the deficit of last year. I have not said, nor do I believe my predecessor said, that the release of extra capital in any circumstances would overheat the economy. I recall in the debate in the House some weeks ago when, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I said that additional capital investment was needed. I hope to make progress on that but we need to be careful that we do not release such quantities of money that we find ourselves in a position where we are back to where we were some years ago with construction and the pricing of property going up and up. The only people who suffer from that in the end are citizens and taxpayers.

Until some months ago, little was known about Project Shift. However, from two previous replies to parliamentary questions we have established that it was not discussed at any NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee meetings. NAMA cannot tell us whether Frank Cushnahan advised the debtor. NAMA will not answer any more questions and the agency has started to hide behind the commission of investigation. I hope the Minister can answer something about it.

While Project Shift and Project Eagle were two separate transactions and were completed as such, given that the same purchaser ultimately was involved in both transactions, it made sense to complete both sales as loan sales. As a result, the Project Shift transaction, which begun as an asset sale, was ultimately transacted as a loan sale. By doing so, NAMA was able to ensure the consistent and efficient completion of the disposal of all of the debtor's loans to Cerberus across both transactions. The Deputy will be also aware that the previous Taoiseach signed SI 267 of 2017 on 13 June 2017 establishing a commission of investigation into Project Eagle. I am advised by NAMA that is likely that the commission of investigation, the terms of reference of which have been approved by Members of the Oireachtas, will consider that Project Shift falls within those terms of reference. On that basis, I am advised by NAMA that it considers it sensible not to comment further on these matters, but that the agency will co-operate fully with the work of the commission and, in the course of that work, NAMA will provide the commission with materials in respect of Project Shift and will answer any questions the commission may have relating to that project. However, as was previously pointed out to the Deputy in Parliamentary Questions Nos. 15 and 31 of 18 May 2017, NAMA has advised that Project Shift was not discussed at meetings of the NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee. More generally, the Deputy will be aware that the former Minister for Finance and my Department are subject to one of the terms of reference of the commission. It would not be advisable for me to comment on any specific matters relating to the commission's work now that it has been established and is operational. The Deputy will be aware that Mr. Justice John Cooke has been appointed to lead the commission of investigation. I am sure he will examine all relevant matters within the terms of reference.

I have spoken to Brian Rowntree several times lately. He said to me that he had never heard of Project Shift. He said that he was led to believe by NAMA, via the chairman, Frank Daly, and Ronnie Hanna, that Project Eagle was the first sale of any element of the Northern Ireland portfolio to a third party loan acquisition group. This is a matter of concern. I cannot understand why NAMA will not tell us whether Frank Cushnahan did or did not advise the debtor. We have recently found out who the debtor is - he is a pretty serious player. Can the Minister get an answer to that? Although little is known about Project Shift we have found out from an internal e-mail that Ron Bolger represented Cerberus on the deal. This is the same Ron Bolger that arranged a meeting between the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, and Cerberus the day before Project Eagle.

I will always try to give him the fullest information I can as a Member of the Oireachtas. Many Deputies called for the establishment of a commission of investigation in the aftermath of the Committee of Public Accounts work on aspects of Project Eagle. I cannot publicly provide in the Dáil information in regard to a transaction that may well be subject to inquiry by this commission. It is good to hear that Deputy Wallace has preserved evidence in regard to his concerns around this transaction. I hope he will be in a position to share that with the commission. That body and Justice Cooke are best placed to deal with any issues of public concern in regard to Project Eagle or, if turns out to be the case, Project Shift as well.

It is the wish of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Government that the social housing lists be reduced. This could be done if a number of things were rectified. To be eligible for grant aid from Kerry County Council a person must be 66 years of age. A number of years ago - I cannot recall when - a person in his or her late 50s, whose house was in bad repair, was eligible for grant aid of approximately €8,000, which is a lot of money to those who qualified for it. I have been approached by a number of people aged 50 years upwards who have been refused grant aid because, as I said, to be eligible for a grant a person must be 66 years of age. Many of these people end up on the social housing list because their houses are in bad repair. It may be that the roofs of the houses are leaking or that the windows and doors are in a bad state. Also, many of these people are unemployed. They might be in good shape but they cannot get work. If they were disabled they would be eligible for the disabled person's grant. As these people do not qualify for grant aid for house improvements they end up on the housing list. In regard to the improvement works in lieu, IWL, scheme, while funding provided under this scheme is deemed to be a grant, it is actually a loan. Those who qualify for it are required to pay back a set amount each week to Kerry County Council, often by way of deductions from their social welfare benefits. Many people are being denied this facility because of the stipulation that to qualify a house must have cavity block walls. People whose houses have cavity block walls do not need a grant. People whose houses have stone built walls do not qualify for the improvement works in lieu scheme but they only find this out when their applications have been refused because of this stipulation. I am asking that this provision be reviewed because it is totally unfair. It is the people whose houses have stone walls that are in greatest need of this grant, which in my view should be termed a loan. Applications for these loans are required to be vetted by housing engineers. Applicants should be told in the first instance that if their house has stone walls they should not apply but they are not told this until after an application has been vetted by two engineers. The purpose of the first engineer visit is to determine whether the works qualify under the scheme and this is followed up by a visit from a second engineer, such that much time is invested in and wasted on assessment of applications. I am asking that the Minister review these two schemes. If he does so, it will help stop the flow of people onto the housing lists, as is currently happening in Kerry. There are many such cases arising in the Kerry local authority area.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	411	I thank Deputy Danny Healy-Rae for raising this matter. As Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, I am aware of the challenges we face in delivering housing supports to a range of vulnerable households and groups throughout the country. We held a competition last week in regard to new technologies and developments to help address this situation. I am also very aware of the social benefit accruing from the housing adaptation grants in facilitating older people, in particular, and people with disabilities in continued independent occupancy in their own homes for as long as possible. Our priority and, I am sure, that of Deputy Danny Healy-Rae is to keep people in their homes and communities, where they want to be, for as long as possible and thus keep them off the housing lists. That is our aim and we do everything we can in the Department and across other Departments to help encourage this. The housing aid for older people scheme provides grants of up to €8,000 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out. Eligible works include structural repairs or improvements, rewiring, replacement of windows and doors, sanitary facilities, heating and so on. The detailed administration of the scheme and the prioritisation of individual cases is a matter for local authorities who are familiar with the applicants and their particular housing conditions. This scheme and related schemes were reviewed by my Department in 2013 to identify how they could become more focused and targeted to those who are most in need. Based on the recommendations of this review, the eligibility age limit for the housing aid for older people was increased from 60 to 66 years to bring it in line with the majority of supports for older people. The Deputy mentioned that the age limit in this regard was previously set at 50 years but that he cannot recall when that was the case. I am not sure either when it was set at 50 years but I know that it was increased from 60 to 66 years in 2013. A lower age limit can apply in certain circumstances at the discretion of the local authority. This may happen in particular hardship cases or where medical guidance is provided in the case. However, I do not favour, and I do not intend, to reduce to 50 the age that ordinarily applies to this scheme because I believe that would be very much stretching the definition of a scheme that supports older people. There is no point in my misleading the Deputy: there is no intention to reduce the age limit in respect of eligibility for this scheme but, as I said, the local authorities have the discretion mentioned. These grants need to be directed to those most in need and I believe our older people - they being people 66 or over, with some discretion for exceptional hardship cases - are those who warrant this support. We do not have an endless budget and we need to try to provide assistance to those most in need. That is not to say there are not others who also have need for support but every scheme must have its limits and criteria and I believe that prioritising this scheme for our older people is the right approach. The Deputy also raised an issue in regard to the improvement works in lieu scheme. My Department provides funding to local authorities under this scheme so they can repair, improve or extend privately-owned houses that are occupied by people who are qualified for social housing, as an alternative to providing them with local authority housing. This makes sense. The Deputy is correct that it also takes them off the social housing lists and it maximises the usage of existing houses and sites, where possible. There is no rule under this scheme about cavity walls or stone built walls. What is in the criteria for the scheme is that improvement works to be funded by the local authority should be structurally sound, free from damp and weather-tight. This makes sense; nobody would expect a council to invest public money in a property if it does not consider it satisfies these requirements. If a council did this, it would rightly be criticised for not assessing the building and my Department would be criticised for funding it. There is no rule in regard to cavity or stone walls. If this has been cited as a reason for refusal of an application and the Deputy has examples of this I would be happy to review them. The Deputy will appreciate that my Department is not involved in every assessment and every decision that a council makes on individual applications nor should it be. It is right and proper that such decisions rest with the local council but if the Deputy is unhappy about a particular case, he should raise it with the council directly. If the Deputy has a number of examples of where this has happened I will be happy to review them. There is no rule of the type mentioned by the Deputy. The Department will continue to fund these two important schemes, the housing aid for older people scheme and the improvement works in lieu scheme, with the funding being targeted to those most particularly in need.This is an issue close to the Acting Chairman's heart. We have increased the funding in that space this year, and rightly so. We are doing a great deal of good work here and we want to continue doing that.

He had some interesting answers, particularly regarding the issue of houses with stone walls. What I stated about it is a stipulation by our local authority and it said it was a Department rule. I will have to investigate that further. The housing aid for older people scheme is a great scheme and it had ensured that many elderly people have been able to stay in their own homes. We really appreciate that. A person can be old at the age of 50 or 55. A women who was 102 years old contacted me by phone the other day and from my conversation with her she did not seem to be old. It is all about the way people interpret matters and their attitude. Some people on reaching the age of 50 can be in bad shape and not able to work as they were able to do when they were younger or they may not be able to get a job. We would like if such people could also stay in their homes. If matters improved a little, perhaps the age requirement for grant aid could be reduced. That is what I am asking for and that it be done as soon as possible, as those people would also like to stay in their homes. We need to maximise the houses we have. Many houses are currently vacant but many of them are not fit to live in. I hope those houses are not being counted in the number of vacant houses because many of them are certainly not fit to live in. Even though some of these people are continuing to live in these houses, they are not fit for human habitation, having regard to the modern housing standards enjoyed by most people. If that rule for grant aid could be reduced to under the age of 60, it would help a good few people and keep them off the housing list. A person can find a leak in a roof and on investigation more work may need to be done, which may be costly, and they may be afraid to do it, but repairing it can become more costly if the roof is not repaired when the leak is discovered. There is a good reason for reducing the age requirement. The Minister of State has made me wise about the stone wall issue. The answer I got from the local authority was that a house had to have cavity walls before it could be considered.

The Deputy can go back to the council and tell the people there to check the rules. If there is any doubt about that, I can send the Deputy a letter on it. I am very conscious of the social benefits flowing from the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with disabilities in terms of facilitating their continued independent living for as long as possible, which is what the Deputy has highlighted. I assure him that I, the Department and the Government are committed to that. We spend the money in the best way we possibly can. That is why the funding available for the schemes was increased by 6% this year to an overall funding availability of €59.8 million nationally. Last year more than 8,000 households benefitted under this scheme and this year we predict that possibly up to 9,000 households could benefit from the scheme with the increased funding, and rightly so. It is a good scheme, we get good value for money and it aids people to stay in their homes. We recognise that there is a range of people who seek supports of different kinds but every scheme must have some criteria on which to be able to measure it and spend the money accordingly. Certainly, people who are older and people with disabilities are the ones on whom we have to concentrate the resources and make sure they get what they need. As I said in my opening remarks, we do not favour reducing the limit, although I understand why the Deputy would ask for that. It is not in our plans to do that and I do not want to leave any doubt in the Deputy's mind about that. Regarding the improvement works in lieu scheme, our Department is not involved in every decision and there is no rule regarding the need for a house to have block versus cavity walls. I want to be very clear on that. It is a decision taken on cases by the local authority concerned. That is where the Deputy should start in that respect and if there is a policy issue that we need to change, the Deputy should raise it with me. I would be happy to meet him and discuss it with him. It is very uncommon to come across people living in a house that is not fit for purpose. There are many different schemes and supports available. Common sense is applied and there is flexibility in the criteria. While the bulk of the money is aimed at a certain age group there is enough common sense among those in most local authorities for them to be able to cater for a person's individual needs where that is required. That is what councillors and Deputies do. They find these cases and raise them with local authorities and generally we find solutions. I would mention other schemes that are available. The home renovation incentive scheme is available for private and social housing. Under it, one can spend money on one's house and claim back the valued added tax, VAT, which makes it more attractive. There is the housing aid for older people scheme which I mentioned. There is a mobility aids grant scheme available through local authorities for people of all ages.. There is a better energy home scheme. There is also a grant scheme to replace lead pipes and fittings but, more importantly, the most recent scheme we brought in is one to tackle the issue of vacant properties. We recognise that many vacant properties are not fit for use. We brought in the repair and leasing scheme, where up to €40,000 per house is available to bring a house up to a high standard so that it can be used again. That is available to anybody who owns a property once they make it available for social housing. There are other schemes available for private housing. There should not be a situation where people are left in accommodation that is not fit for purpose.

In terms of what is being trotted out as State intervention with respect to the national broadband plan, during the past four years there have been six different attempts announcing a new broadband plan. I was Opposition spokesperson on communication in the previous Dáil. The then Minister, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to great fanfare, announced in 2014 that there was a scheme and his successor, the former Minister, Alex White, had another scheme. We debated it across the floor of the Dáil in the context of State aids and it was brought to Europe and passed by it. There was to be a procurement process and contracts signed. However, nothing happened about it. The latest announcement is that it will be further delayed than was envisaged. If somebody had said in 2013 or 2014 that we would still be talking about the national broadband plan in 2017, we would be laughed at. There is a crisis due to the lack of access. Deputy Martin spoke about this yesterday. He visited Kanturk and spoke to small business owners. We have apartheid across the country in terms of broadband access, not only for people in rural Ireland but for communities who do not have access to it. The Minister announced that Eir will connect 300,000 homes but, as I understand it, that is boosting the connectivity they already have. The reality is that the communities, households and businesses which want broadband cannot access it. There does not seem to be any coherent strategic plan in place. Where is the bid for it and the development of State aid to intervene to ensure broadband is brought to every community? We are dividing the country on this in a major way. It is the same as what happened with the provision of telephones in the 1970s and electricity connection in the 1940s and 1950s. I ask the Minister to give us a realistic plan and not some palaver that the Department has trotted out that there will be something in 2019, 2021 or some time into the next century. We need urgent action on this now.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	420	Central Statistic Office figures released recently show that County Tipperary had a number of unemployment blackspots. That is an area where there is more than 27% unemployment. The figure across the county was significantly higher than the national average. A number of electoral divisions, 26 in all, including places like Farranrory, Mullinahone, Fethard, Ballingarry, Littleton, Killenaule, Roscrea, Graigue, Poyntstown, Borrisokane, Finnoe, Ballyphillip, Kilcommon and Templemore, had 5% unemployment above the national average. I give that detail before I move on to speak about the national broadband plan. Broadband is a vital piece of infrastructural development for industry and job creation.A minimum of 30 Mbps is essential in order to work from home, to maintain and create employment and to establish new industries, in particular in rural areas. There is widespread concern and dismay that the Minister's recent announcement will delay further the implementation of the roll out of broadband in rural areas. This goes back to 2012 when it was initially announced. Deputy Naughten may be the third Minister to deal with this. It appears now that there will be no construction of broadband in rural areas until at least 2019 and that it will take a further four to five years to have the broadband structure in place in rural areas. There is widespread concern and dismay on this. Will the Minister outline a realistic plan for broadband throughout rural areas?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	421	In recent days there has been some ill-informed commentary in regard to the national broadband plan which surprised me. It is important that I state the factual position for the record of this House. The national broadband plan is a Government priority and will deliver high speed broadband to every citizen and business in Ireland. Our ambition is clear. It is to achieve 100% coverage of high speed broadband across Ireland, urban and rural. It is important to be clear that the objective of 100% coverage of high speed broadband will be achieved through a combination of accelerated investment by commercial telecoms operators and a State intervention for those parts of the country where there is no certainty that commercial operators will provide a service. The Government's national broadband plan has been very successful in encouraging increased levels of investment by commercial operators. This in turn means that more people will have access to high speed broadband at an early date and also reduces the number of premises to be included in the State intervention. Ireland would not be experiencing the current level of investment by commercial operators were it not for the strong commitment by this Government to the national broadband plan. As a direct result of the Government’s commitment to deliver the national broadband plan we are witnessing a step change in the numbers of homes and businesses that are getting access to high speed broadband. Over the next 76 weeks, farms, schools, homes, post offices and businesses in rural parts of Tipperary will get broadband access, and the vast majority of these will be fibre broadband. That is one in three premises in County Tipperary which did not have broadband until now.  In the constituency of Cork North West, there will be 6,188 premises. That is just short of one in three premises which did not have access to high speed broadband this time last year. That will happen within the next 76 weeks. The figures speak for themselves. When I became Minister 12 months ago, only 52% of premises in Ireland had access to high speed broadband. Today that has increased to 61% and in the next 76 weeks over 77% of premises in Ireland will have access to high speed broadband. With commercial investment and the Government national broadband plan that will rise to more than nine in ten premises in this country by the next 100 weeks. If Deputies are looking for evidence that the commercial sector is taking the Government’s commitment to the national broadband plan seriously, they do not have to look beyond the hundreds of millions in hard cash that industry continues to invest, with an average of €1.6 million being spent each day.  I will turn now to the procurement process being managed by my Department to select a bidder, or bidders, to build out a high speed broadband network to those areas where commercial operators will not provide a service. The procurement process is making good progress in parallel with the roll out by commercial operators. There is no question of the Government waiting for any commercial investment to conclude before shovels are put in the ground on the national broadband plan State intervention phase. I have stated this on several occasions so I do not understand the inaccuracies that some media are currently reporting on the timelines. In April of this year, the map for the procurement process was finalised and it now includes 542,000 premises. Last month bidders were invited to submit their detailed solutions by September. The detailed solutions stage of the procurement process is the final stage before moving to final tenders.

Coming from Roscommon, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, understands it. However, if one takes the figure of one in three that he quoted for Cork North West, that will be places such as Ballincollig, Macroom, Charleville, Kanturk. I am talking about other regions such as western Duhallow and other rural communities. The Minister will forgive me for being cynical but I have listened to Ministers for four or five years saying they are making good progress. What does that mean? What does reporting on timelines mean? As society is moving on and as technology develops and proper broadband becomes a basic tool of life, it is even more serious than electricity or the phone, it is more like running water. I appeal to the Minister to grab this with both hands because it is a crisis. When people look at buying houses or sites, they want to know about broadband connectivity and when will it be in place. When I said I was raising this issue, many people said they do not even have mobile phone coverage in some areas of the constituency, never mind broadband. Good progress is not enough. The Minister needs to tell us what the timelines are because we have heard it all before.

There is widespread concern and dismay that it might be delayed further. I welcome 15,000 premises, or the one third, which will get high-speed broadband within the next 18 months, but what about the other two thirds, the other 30,000? When will they get it? From reports and from a question to which the Minister responded, it suggests that the roll-out of broadband for that 30,000 will not commence until January 2019. Will the Minister confirm the position in regard to those 30,000 premises in Tipperary and the equivalent across the country? When will the work start and when will the installation commence and when will it be completed? We will be seven years on from the initial announcement of the national broadband plan.

We are currently passing one house every minute of every working day. That momentum will continue until every premises in this country has access to high-speed broadband. I am determined to make sure this is fulfilled. Deputy Moynihan is right to be sick and tired of people promising dates. I am sick to the eye teeth about that. My focus is on delivery. We are delivering pure fibre broadband to these homes. The types of speed they have in New York are now available in isolated rural communities throughout this country. That will continue until every one of these premises get it. Deputy Healy asked what will happen in the meantime, before these premises get it. That is a legitimate question. I have just come from the most recent mobile broadband and wireless task force meeting. As we speak, we are rolling out infrastructure in 4G and wireless broadband services. Two weeks ago, I made an announcement regarding Eurona Ireland. Imagine is rolling out wireless services across the country. This is happening as we speak. People are getting access to services. Every single possible operator will provide as many options to people both in the short and medium term. I am determined to ensure every single premises will get this as quickly as possible and not one day later than is absolutely necessary. I am putting as much pressure on as I can to ensure that both the commercial and non-commercial aspects of this proceed without any delays so people can get broadband. I ask Deputies to consider the facts. Within the next 76 weeks, as Minister I will have delivered broadband to one in every four premises in this country. That is on foot of the actions I have taken as Minister. I intend to continue with this until every single premises has broadband.

As the Minister of State is aware, Naas General Hospital is an acute hospital with 243 beds, providing inpatient, general medical, surgical and acute psychiatric services, as well as a 24-hour emergency service to its immediate catchment population of Kildare and Wicklow. That is close to 250,000 people. Naas General Hospital works closely with Tallaght hospital and shares many consultant posts. Naas General Hospital is part of the Dublin Midlands hospital group, as the Minister of State knows, and Trinity College Dublin is the academic partner. The hospital's current endoscopic unit is within one building that has been deemed not fit for purpose following a joint advisory group inspection in 2009. It comprises one endoscopy room in a prefabricated structure and the Minister, Deputy Harris, visited it last November and is very aware it is not fit for purpose. Endoscopy and day ward development for the Dublin Midlands hospital group is a key enabler for group-wide development and cross-site work, particularly with regard to Naas and Tallaght. Naas General Hospital received planning permission in January 2015 for the development of the new endoscopy and day ward unit, which would increase day ward capacity from 11 to 25 day beds. I will touch later on some of the demographics of County Kildare and west Wicklow, with their rising populations, and the staff and management in Naas are doing an amazing job despite increasing attendance at the hospital. For example, accident and emergency attendance has increased more than 4% and inpatient attendance has increased by more than 2%. There are capacity issues in Naas due to the increased volumes and staff are doing a remarkable job. Staff morale has been affected by the fact that a previous Government ten years ago promised this endoscopy unit. There was a belief it was coming but it never materialised. As we head into a review of the capital plan, this is a crucial development for health services in Kildare. There is a bigger benefit. The Minister, Deputy Harris, had meetings at the end of last year and in Leinster House this year with the consultants from the endoscopy unit in Naas and representatives of the hospital group. The strongest case did not come from Naas but from Dr. Susan O'Reilly, and those from St. James's and Tallaght hospitals, who will see a major benefit in Naas developing its endoscopy unit. There will be a benefit for Kildare residents who will not have to travel and there will also be a reduction in waiting lists, and St. James's Hospital has very significant urology waiting lists. The capacity element and these benefits mean there is a really strong business case for this to happen. Enabling works for the project have been carried out already, which primarily consist of an upgrade to the hospital power supply system. They were undertaken between 2014 and 2016 at a cost of €1.5 million. The project is very much shovel-ready and unlike other projects in the hospital grouping, if we can secure State funding for it, we can go straight away. It has gone through all the approval processes with the Health Service Executive and design and planning stages are complete. It is ready to go. However, the capital cashflow required to fund the project is awaited and not yet allocated. The cost of the proposed new build is €11 million spread over three years and, depending on start date and phasing options, the cost may be spread, with approximately €2 million in year one, €5 million in year two and €4 million in year three, so all the €11 million would not be needed upfront. As a key priority, the project would increase our ability and capacity to manage our increasing elective workload across a range of services for Kildare and west Wicklow in the Dublin Midlands hospital group in specialist areas such as ear, nose and throat treatment; urology; neurology and gastroenterology. Naas and Tallaght hospitals have recently appointed consultants in all these areas and these are excellent practitioners, working under difficult conditions. They deserve better and increased capacity so we can tackle waiting lists and ensure Kildare people do not have to travel for such services or wait any longer than they do.

It is timely as the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform are facing into the mid-term review of the capital spend. I appreciate it and it is helpful for the officials in my Department in trying to secure necessary funding for very important projects. The Deputy made the point very well about the importance not just of this project as a stand-alone issue but it serves a population of more than 220,000 people. It is networked with bigger hospitals in Dublin, with an overall benefit accruing to the hospitals with the supply of an important service. I welcome Deputy Heydon's focus on this project. It is vital that my Department gets this funding under the mid-term review to progress this worthy project. I welcome the opportunity to update the House on this Naas General Hospital project. As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Health, met the management of Naas hospital in April 2017 to discuss the plans for increased endoscopy and other health care services. The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group advised that this new development is a key strategic priority for the group. This development would help to clear the significant urgent scopes waiting list and Naas hospital would become a major ambulatory centre within the hospital group. This development would also enable significant strategic links to be developed between Naas, Tallaght and St. James's hospitals. The project to be delivered at Naas General Hospital is more extensive than the endoscopy services department and associated works. It also includes accommodation and ancillary services to support the new physical medicine, physical therapy, oncology services and day procedures departments; a duplex - rather than simplex - reverse osmosis filtration system; and two lifts. All stages of capital projects, including the design and tendering processes, are subject to review to ensure the projects deliver value for money. This includes, where possible, future proofing to ensure capital developments meet not just current standards but that provision is made for additional capacity and improved equipping, and that these are addressed appropriately. This has resulted in a significant increase in the scope of the project and as a consequence its estimated cost. I can confirm the Department has forwarded its submission under the mid-term review of the capital programme to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The submission is based on the projected funding requirement arising from existing commitments, strategies, demand-led service needs and commitments contained in the programme for partnership Government. At this stage in the process it is not proposed to specify the individual project details contained in the Department's submission. However, as with all health care projects, including this project, further investment in hospitals must be considered within the overall acute hospital sector infrastructure programme, the prioritised needs of the hospital groups and within the overall capital envelope available to the health service. I will be happy to keep the Deputy updated on this important project.

For me, that is about all the different parts of infrastructure in this country that we will develop for the betterment of citizens. There are many cases where it makes economic sense to spend money on infrastructure that will lead to savings and this is a perfect case in point. It is about developing and expanding the endoscopy unit at Naas General Hospital and the hospital grouping of which Naas is a part. The group has identified efficiencies and Tallaght hospital is currently renting rooms at the Beacon Hospital for endoscopic services. If this unit at Naas was completed, the group could use it instead and generate savings for the group as a whole. St. James's Hospital would also use Naas for urology services. The completion of this new unit and extension would secure the future of Naas hospital as a key strategic part of the group. It is very important to the people of Kildare and west Wicklow but it is important we solidify its base within the group as a whole for the future. I wish the Minister of State well in his new role with responsibility for mental health and older people. I look forward to him visiting Naas and Kildare, where there is a large population of older people because of the large number of nursing homes in our county. That is because of our close proximity to Dublin. Similarly, we have one of the youngest populations in the country and our mental health services are not fit for purpose. The former Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy McEntee, visited us recently and we have received an allocation for the expansion of the Lakeview unit at Naas hospital.There is potential for further expansion. I know the Minister of State is aware, as we discussed it previously and will explore it further, of the need to ensure that Lakeview mental health services are fit for purpose for the next generation because they do not have the capacity currently to meet the significant demand in Kildare. That, along with the endoscopy unit, is a vital investment we need to see in our health services in Kildare. I look forward to working with the Minister of State and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on it into the future.

I assure him of the Government's commitment to the future of this hospital and to seeing it progress, and not just as a stand-alone project. This year, €58 million has been committed to Naas General Hospital, which is a very significant part of the health budget and is well deserved. I pay tribute to and acknowledge the commitment and dedication of the staff in the hospital but also the management team, the hospital network and group that are looking ahead. They will have their ducks in a row to ensure that Naas General Hospital can avail of the funding that will become available in any capital development plan. I commend them for future proofing those projects and for their forward thinking in that regard. The integral role Naas General Hospital plays is recognised, not just in terms of the immediate catchment area of almost 1.25 million people but in terms of the entire hospital network, including St. James's and Tallaght hospitals. The number of people it serves is a crucial cog in that wheel. That is well recognised by the Department and the Health Service Executive and will ensure that these projects are progressed in a timely and progressive manner. I thank the Deputy for his interest in the project and ensuring that it receives ongoing attention at a political level and proceeds to completion. We all want to see those stages. On the Deputy's closing comments about mental health services, I would be delighted to take him up on his invitation to visit the area to see what is not working and, more importantly, what is not working with a view to seeing how we can, with his help and that of the other Members in Kildare, address the shortcomings in the services. I look forward to that.

I begin by wishing him the very best in his new role. Yesterday, an article in The Irish Times, which the Minister of State might have read, stated that over 2,400 children were waiting for child mental health services. The Minister may ask what that has to do with the Topical Issue matter I raise. I will quote two parts of the article. It states, "Anne O'Connor, national director mental health, HSE, points out that CAMHS was never designed to be a catch-all service, but to cater for children and adolescents with severe and enduring mental illnesses". She goes on, in an extensive article on which I compliment her, to refer to Galway youth counselling services. She states, "Deirdre Bermingham, managing director of Youth Work Ireland Galway, says that in 2011 they identified a gap for the young people they worked with in accessing counselling services". With funds from dormant accounts and the Maureen O'Connell trust they were able to help families. Since 2011, the group has managed to help 800 families, but now they face the closing of their doors.

This does not make sense. Galway's youth counselling service is excellent, with 800 adolescents having come through its door since 2012, 191 of those in 2016. It provides a service to Tuam, Ballinasloe, Loughrea and Galway city. It has struggled, but it has provided an excellent service. It is unique because that young adult age group can walk in the door, so most of the referrals are from families, schools, to a lesser extent from the health service, the gardaí and so on. It provides a unique venue in that young people are going in for other services and can avail of this specialist service. They are simply asking for a stable source of funding to enable this work to continue. It is cost effective on every level and I ask the Minister of State to take a hands-on approach to its imminent closure and prevent it.

We represent the constituencies of Galway East and Galway West. Deputies Rabbitte and Connolly have made very clear our concerns about the cessation of the mental health services provided by Youth Work Ireland in Galway. We met with young people in Youth Work Ireland Galway this week and they spoke eloquently about the benefits Youth Work Ireland Galway provides for them. This is a service which does not require a referral from a doctor. Teenagers and children as young as 12 can walk in and speak to a qualified counsellor at their ease in a very informal setting. There is huge benefit from that. The funding that would be required to keep this service going is minimal in the grand scheme of things. I urge the Minister of State to look favourably on this service because it is critical for the young people of Galway East and West.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	435	I thank the Members for their contributions and for bringing this vital piece of infrastructure in Galway, and the challenges facing it, to my attention. Mental health is a key care programme for this Government. Reflecting the priority we attach to this, HSE mental health funding increased from €826 million in 2016 to over €850 million this year. That will enable the continued development of a range of services including adult, child and adolescent, forensic and specialist services in mental health. In particular, €5 million has been provided to extend the counselling in primary care, CIPC, programme to under 18s. The counselling in primary care, CIPC, initiative, launched in June 2013, is a national service provided under the governance framework of the national counselling service of the HSE. Short-term counselling is provided for adults with non-complex psychological problems aged 18 and over, and who hold a valid medical card. Referral into the service is by the person’s general practitioner, GP, or another member of the primary care team. CIPC is a short-term counselling service that provides up to eight counselling sessions with a professionally qualified and accredited counsellor or therapist. Within the specialist secondary care mental health service counselling and psychotherapy is provided within community mental health teams, when service users are clinically assessed as requiring this intervention. Counselling is also provided by a range of voluntary organisations across the health service, and the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention funds voluntary organisations such as Pieta House to provide support across a range of needs. The provision of a quality counselling service across both primary and secondary care will be developed further, as resources permit. In the first instance, the HSE mental health division must ensure that the funding currently allocated is being used to best effect to deliver the best outcomes. I understand that Youth Work Ireland is a counselling service based in County Galway. It was formed in 2011 to deliver a youth counselling service. The group works closely with Jigsaw, Galway adult counselling HSE, primary care clinical psychology HSE and the Galway Traveller Movement. Counselling is also specifically provided for young people aged 12 to 21 years, delivered over a period of 38 weeks annually. Currently, the service is based in Galway city, Tuam, Ballinasloe and Loughrea. The counsellors who deliver the service are fully accredited and suitably qualified to work with adolescents. Funding had originally been provided for a three year period by St. Vincent De Paul, as well as other sources such as Electric Aid, local schools, etc. This time-limited funding stream ceased last year. The local HSE resource office for suicide prevention provided €15,000 to ensure continuity of this service. The executive has recently committed to providing the same amount for 2017, in addition to a smaller funding contribution to the group from Tusla. I understand that the HSE is reviewing the position of the group, including the concerns raised by the Deputies.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	436	I thank the Minister of State for his response, but it is the response I expected. I have been raising this issue through communications with the former Minister of State in the Department, Deputy McEntee, for the past number of months because a red flag was raised about it. I would have communicated with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Harris and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to try to find where it would fit into. I am delighted the Minister of State is here to take the issue today because it is a HSE issue. It would cost €35,000 to run this service on an annual basis. If that figure is divided by the number of children who are availing of it, it works out at €175 of an investment per child over a 12 week period. These children are knocking on the door asking for help. As Deputy Connolly said, 50% refer themselves. Are we going to tell those children that we will not give them the €175 because we do not believe in that investment? Those children need to hear from the Minister of State that a lifeline in the form of an investment will be given by this Government. They can no longer shake fund-raising buckets at people in an effort to raise funding to keep the doors open and save children's lives.

However, I honestly would have expected a different answer. This is a service that is working and it should be examined because it really could inform policy. The figure mentioned by Deputy Anne Rabbitte is in regard to the existing service, which is looking for a slight increase to cover three new areas, Gort, Carna and Clifden. It is a unique service because Jigsaw does not give a service to 12 year olds. We have these young children and adolescents walking in, getting a unique service and coming out the better for it, as they informed us when we met them on Monday. We are standing here across party and across constituencies in that we have support from all three constituencies, Galway West, Galway East and Roscommon-Galway. I am appealing to the Minister of State to take a hands-on approach. I appreciate it is Civil Service-speak that has come back in the answer and we do not need that. These are young people who have shown an interest in the political system, who have used their time to educate us and who have given us a solution, and that solution will save the Government money. I hesitate to mention the suicide statistics for that age group and I want to avoid that. I ask the Minister of State to come back to us with a hands-on approach.

As Deputy Rabbitte outlined, it is €35,000 to continue the counselling service and €60,000 in total for the year. The HSE is reviewing the position. I ask the Minister of State to look favourably on this and to work with the HSE to see what can be done to ensure this critical service for our young people is continued.

One of the interesting lines I took from what Deputy Connolly alluded to as Civil Service-speak is that, "The counsellors that deliver the service are fully accredited and suitably qualified to work with adolescents". For me, that is one of the more important lines. Obviously, before I make any commitment, either here or anywhere else, I have a responsibility to see that this is there. Given it is there in written form, I take comfort from that. Deputy Rabbitte is right that this is not just 800 people but 800 families. It has a very significant impact on people, their well-being and the cohesiveness of communities to have families functioning well. Of course, we have to invest. As all speakers have said, these are people who walk in, put their hand up and say, "I need help". If we as a State are going to let them down and not react to their needs, then we are all at nothing here. While I cannot give a commitment right here and now, I will give the Deputies a commitment to take this on myself and to have a look at it. I will come back to the three Deputies within a week and will meet them within a week, and I will have some progress made on this issue within that week. I am not aware the service has made any funding application to the HSE under section 39 or the lottery funding, which are the two avenues whereby it can apply to the HSE. Before next week, the Deputies might ascertain from the service whether it has applied to the HSE under section 39 or the lottery funding. I appreciate what the Deputies have said about the amount of money in the greater scheme of things. It is a critical service. I give my commitment to address this issue personally within a week and to come back to the three Deputies within a week. That is what we are here for, namely, to try to solve these issues.

I also welcome representatives from SIPTU, IMPACT, the Association of Childhood Professionals, Early Childhood Ireland and the Children's Rights Alliance. I thank them for their support for the motion and all of the very important advocacy work they carry out on behalf of the early years sector and the children for whom they care. From the get-go it is crucial that we all recognise the obvious fact that without early years service providers and staff, many of us in the Oireachtas would not be able to come to work every morning. Society relies heavily on the sector in order to operate. As the mother of two boys, a Deputy and my party’s spokesperson on child care and the early years sector, I understand and appreciate the work done by those involved in it. For far too long the sector has been viewed simply as a form of baby sitting. Thankfully, there has more recently been a shift in attitude. There is a recognition that national and international evidence shows high-quality early childhood education and care has positive outcomes for children and society and that these positive outcomes are even stronger for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, the benefits are reliant on high-quality provision. In Ireland we have focused on regulation and training to ensure high-quality provision, but it is well documented that staff working conditions and pay are central to providing high-quality early childhood education and care. It is vital for all of us, as public representatives, to acknowledge publicly the impact of the work carried out in the early years sector. The quality of care provided is crucial for the early development of future generations. It provides the stepping stone to their further education. Early years settings are often where learning difficulties or social issues can be detected, improving a child’s chances of getting help and assessing the level of assistance he or she might need to prevent future problems, developmental or otherwise. The start we give our children inevitably impacts on their progress and can significantly improve their outcomes. There is an intrinsic link between the working conditions of those responsible for children and quality of care and outcomes. It is common sense that if staff members are overworked, underpaid and highly stressed, as committed as they may be, the outcomes for the children for whom they care will not be as positive as for those being cared for by people who feel valued and have relative job security. This summer approximately 3,500 early years educators will sign on for social welfare, at an estimated cost of €7.5 million to the Exchequer. This number does not include the thousands of providers who are unable to sign on because they are classified as self-employed, nor does it include younger members of the profession who are not entitled to social welfare owing to their parents' income. The figure of €7.5 million also does not include the cost for those who are eligible to receive family income supplement because their income is so low.The following quotes are from highly qualified staff and service providers who are working in the sector and looking towards a summer of uncertainty:On our last day in preschool, the parents were wishing me well for the holidays and asking where I was going for my holidays. The reality is that I am signing on for the summer and cannot afford to go on holidays because my wages are so low I do not have any savings. I am dreading my car insurance bill which is due at the end of July and I do not know what I would do if my car broke down.Another said:My work is not recognised for the early education that it really is. Children’s learning starts at birth and we need to remember that. We need to respect the children’s rights to have the best start in life and not just the parent’s rights to go out to work. If we did, then things would change.Another said:I am signing on for the summer but we are waiting to hear if we got the capital grant from Pobal. If we do get it, I will be dealing with builders for the summer but I will not be getting paid for it but sure it has to be done. I am 28 years in the sector and I am getting so tired.Another said:I did not realise that I would only be able to afford to work in early years for a few years until I have a family of my own. I definitely will not be able to afford a mortgage or child care in the future so I am already looking at changing my career.The quality of the relationships between the children and the workforce is one of the key indicators of high-quality provision. Attracting and retaining a professional workforce are vital if these relationships are to flourish, but this cannot be achieved if the level of Government investment is so low that the workforce is on little more than the minimum wage. In 2010 an EU funded report highlighted that a poorly paid and poorly educated workforce diminished the quality of early education, as well as being unsustainable. The costs for the proposed affordable child care scheme include wages for qualified, experienced early years educators, at €10.79 per hour for 48 weeks. Now that the scheme will be operated for 52 weeks, the figure is even lower. The scheme also recommends that "efficiency can be achieved through managing staff resources to match staff on duty to the varying numbers of children at different times of the day and different times of the year". This demonstrates that the Government’s policy is committed to exploiting the early years workforce with not much regard for staff deserving a living wage or regular hours of work. This aspect must be reassessed. Services are struggling with an IT system that is not fit for purpose; dates promised for the payment of non-contact time have not been met and grants have not been approved in the timeframe promised. So far, there has been no payment for all of the extra administration work required in delivering the new scheme. This is seriously frustrating service providers and creating a pressure cooker which is ready to explode. Service providers have stated the Government is banking on a majority of providers offering the affordable child care scheme. However, some have already decided not to offer it as the increased administration work will add further hours of unpaid work. Since the introduction of the successful early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, many service providers have said they believe they have effectively become unpaid administrators for the Department. However, they have also stated they want to work with it and that, with a fair administration cost and a fair capitation payment, they can help to ensure 70,000 children will benefit from the new scheme. When we say Ireland spends 0.5% of gross domestic product on early years provision, we must acknowledge the reality that the majority is actually spent on infant classes in primary schools. This means that, in effect, we are spending little more than 0.1% on early years services. We are at the bottom of the OECD table in the level of expenditure on early childhood educational institutions. This results in significantly raised costs for parents, unsustainable services and poor pay and conditions for the early years workforce. While the Government has increased the early years budget in recent years, much of the increase has been focused on affordability and accessibility. While this is necessary for working parents, it means that sustainability, as well as the pay and working conditions of the workforce, have suffered as a result. More and more is required of the workforce in terms of regulation, qualifications, training, interactions with parents and external agencies. Interactions with children are being hampered as the professionals working with them are torn in meeting all of the requirements that rain down on them. That is the reality and the Government needs to listen. In 2013 the expert advisory group on the early years strategy, appointed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, published its report, Right from the Start. It recommended a graduate-led workforce and agreed salary scales being conditions of public funding. Unfortunately, despite the fact that we are past the midway point of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures Framework 2014-2020, there is still no early years strategy. Unless the conditions and pay of those working in the sector are improved and unless the State increases the funding for services tied to quality and implementation of decent pay scales, the crisis will only deepen. We must address the issues now in order that we can create a sustainable sector that is fair for workers and the children for whom they care. Improvements will only happen with proper investment in child care in budget 2018.

Budget 2017 saw the introduction of the foundations of a new model as regards how child care would be funded. The scene is set for a model which potentially could actively attack the astronomical cost of child care throughout the State. Is maith an rud é sin agus cuirim fáilte roimhe. Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as ucht an méid sin. Although the scene may be set, it looks like it will turn out to be a low-budget production, certainly for those working in the sector and with parents seeing little difference in their pockets. Perhaps this might change with a significant investment being secured by the Minister in budget 2018. Given the Taoiseach’s talk of tax cuts within an already reduced fiscal space, I have my doubts. He has said it is his No. 1 priority, but I will not be holding my breath. I hope to be proved wrong, but I suspect the early years sector will take a back seat to misguided tax cuts. It is estimated that the child care sector employs over 25,000 people, a significant and growing workforce. Many other sectors employ fewer numbers than the child care sector, yet child care professionals have struggled to receive the same level of recognition as those in other sectors when it comes to reasonable demands for pay and respect. It is a low-paid and predominantly female sector. The precarious nature of child care work must also be noted in terms of how young workers view it and whether this necessary service, one on which countless parents rely, is seen as a viable career. Many are paid little more than €10 an hour, despite a great deal of unpaid contact time and having trained for many years to gain qualifications. What would attract people to embark on years of study at significant cost in their journey to become an early years educator? Many who have gone to great lengths to gain the qualifications required to work in the sector are now, in effect, being forced out. Roughly three out of every five workers who left in the past 12 months did so because they did not believe it was a financially sustainable career choice. Child care workers are certainly not motivated by money when they embark on their career. Instead, they are motivated by their wish to care for and nurture children at a young age. We are fortunate to have such a committed workforce. They have, however, been taken for granted by successive Governments, including this one. The motion addresses the failures of successive Governments in acting on the needs of child care workers, all the while aiming to acknowledge the value of the role they play in early years education. Child care workers have for too long accepted poor working conditions and poor rates of pay. The average hourly rate for a child care assistant is just €10.27. According to SIPTU, many of these workers pay almost €5,000 to gain their professional qualifications, but they can earn as little as €5,700 per year. I anticipate that the Minister and her Department will counter with the argument that the State is not the employer, a point it has made numerous times. While it is technically correct, the State put in place the budget for the affordable child care scheme, the ECCE scheme and others. It did so on the reliance that pay would be at a certain level. The policy document which underpinned the affordable child care scheme based the rates of pay on several sources, including Susan Brocklesby’s report, Breaking Point. What it has missed, however, is that what Susan Brocklesby was describing was a sector that was already unsustainable.It is worth making that point. The Government has the chequebook for these schemes. Most of the employers are relying to a large extent on these schemes, and the Government does have the ability to influence pay. Of that there is no question. For many of these workers, relative poverty is something that must be endured, despite having a full-time job that carries great responsibility. The struggle to make ends meet is very real for many. There are workers working 40 hours per week worrying at the end of the month about bills and insurance, which is quite frightening and wrong. These staff are the people who rise early in the morning to go out to do a fair day's work for a less than a fair day's pay. Maybe these are the people the Taoiseach was talking about but somehow I doubt it. I am saying all this without referring to the absurd and undignified circumstances requiring one to sign on for social welfare benefits for the summer months, as covered well by Deputy Funchion. The issue of 38-week contracts can and must be addressed. It is of no shock that 86% of child care service providers said they were concerned that the recruitment and retention of staff threatened their services, for many of the reasons that have been outlined. This motion is part of the overall solution. I want to return to the issue of the sustainability of the community child care sector, which I raised with the Minister yesterday. These issues are closely linked. I first brought this to the Minister's attention about 12 months ago. Since then it has come to light that, unless something drastic changes, 18 early-years community services in Cork city alone face the threat of closure by September 2018, and that fact remains as true as when I first put it to the Minister. It has severe implications for the affected communities and the workers in the services. Many of these services are for children between zero and three, and they are crucial for early intervention. They are located in disadvantaged communities that benefit from early intervention. The Minister has responded on a number of occasions, making reference to a €1 million fund for sustainability. That money was promised 185 days ago, and the second tranche – the main part of the funding – has not been received. In the meantime, services are using reserves and finding all sorts of ways to keep going in the hope that this money will finally arrive soon. They have been strung along by the Department, however, and that is not good enough. They need this funding now. The managers and staff in the services desperately need it. I understand that at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs roadshow, a departmental official stated community early years services deemed unsustainable by review would not receive the payment. These are not profit-making services. The only way that they can be made sustainable is by cutting wages or services, or by raising fees for parents, in some of the most disadvantaged communities. If these services are unsustainable, it is because of departmental underfunding. We have to face up to this. We are going down a dangerous route and if we do not properly fund community services we will be pursuing a model of increased reliance on large-scale chains of private child care providers operating on the basis of profit. This is not the model we should be pursuing. We should be moving in the opposite direction. We should be trying to establish more publicly funded providers that can provide salaried jobs - permanent, well-paying jobs - and become quality public services. The services should be public and provided in the manner I describe. We are putting a very valuable part of this sector at great peril.  There ought to be proper recognition of those who work in the early-years sector and they should be remunerated for the work they do. Recognition is long overdue. The Government can begin on this path by treating workers with both the dignity and respect they deserve.

It is no wonder that those workers feel undervalued. We have certainly established that they are overworked. I thank and commend my colleague Deputy Funchion for the work she has done in this area because it needs to be highlighted. Early Childhood Ireland research has shown that 36% of service providers who have tried to recruit staff in the past 12 months were unable to find anyone suitable. The same research showed that 46% of those who did manage to recruit had to settle for someone with lower qualifications than they wanted. That is a problem. I am a parent and my daughter was in a crèche. I am a grandparent and my grandson is in a crèche. I want to know and believe that the people who are looking after my daughter and grandson are well paid, well looked after and well regarded. It is very worrying when we see the statistics and that the work of these people is not valued. It should be valued because they are looking after our most precious resource, it could be argued. The high turnover of staff and the lack of staff in certain instances are not good for children. They are not good for their intellectual or emotional development. The OECD's Education at a Glance report highlighted that poor quality early-years education and care harms a child's development. The Minister knows this very well. We should be nurturing our children. Parents do not want their children to be looked after in an environment where the workers providing the care and who are nurturing are not valued or respected and in which they are not paid appropriately. Of course, parents want affordable child care. That is vital. It is vital in my constituency, Dublin Fingal, which has the youngest population in the State. Of course we want affordable child care but not at the expense of the workers who are at the coalface providing it. While the Government is demanding services, more highly qualified staff and the raising of standards, which are all welcome, it is hypocritical if the supports needed are not provided to the people who are delivering the care. It is the State's problem. It is the State's role to step in and regulate the sector. It is the State's role to ensure children can gain access to good quality child care that is affordable and delivered in a place where the workers are respected and treated decently, and where they have job security. The latter is very important, particularly because it is a female-dominated profession.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	444	I welcome the professionals and advocates. The first big step to changing Irish child care forever is now just eight weeks away. Up to 70,000 children will benefit from extra subsidies and supports. It will be an important moment. This is the first big practical step to changing one of the most expensive child care systems in the world into one of the best. By addressing the affordability issue, we will ease the burden on many parents for whom child care costs have become a second rent or mortgage. The changes are radical and represent real change. I am particularly happy that we are delivering the highest level of supports to those families who need it most — with supports of up to €7,500 available per child. Deputies will be aware that there are two elements to the payments we are introducing. There are universal payments available for all children aged between six and 36 months and then there are targeted supports. It is these targeted supports that will open up jobs, training and education for parents who want to lift their families out of poverty. Overall, total spending on child care programmes this year is €466 million, which represents a 79% increase on figures from 2015. I mention this solely to highlight the progress that has been achieved, in particular over the past year. From the outset, I have been clear that despite the increases in funding we are only at the beginning. If we are to achieve a truly affordable accessible child care system, there is more to be done. As Minister, I am working to correct policies by successive Governments which have left Ireland bottom of the OECD league in terms of child care investment. Affordability is one step. Of course we must also continue to focus on quality. In order to ensure quality child care, we must ensure that it is a sector where dedication, qualifications and skills are recognised and rewarded.Addressing the concerns of those who provide child care in our communities requires new approaches. It is time to think outside of the box. As Minister, I established the National Early Years Forum and in that context I have met with members of the Association of Childhood Professionals, private early education providers, the community forum and Childminding Ireland on a number of occasions. I have visited child care centres throughout the country. I have addressed Early Childhood Ireland twice. I have met trade union representatives both at Early Childhood events and informally through my officials. Each discussion, meeting and encounter reinforced what I already knew as a long-standing campaigner in the areas of child care, education and community work. It is clear that the significant progress we have made in opening up training and qualification opportunities for the child care sector is not being matched with better pay and conditions. In terms of pay and conditions, new approaches need to be explored. The Government is not the employer in the child care sector. However, to me, it is unacceptable that as a Government we would be oblivious to the needs of people who provide such a vital service to children, parents and families. I have raised this with the Early Years Forum and with my Cabinet colleagues consistently, as recently as this morning at our meeting. One approach would be a sectoral employment order through either the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court. Under such an order, organisations representing employers and employees come together to agree a way forward. This process through the State’s industrial relations mechanism would be supported by submissions from other relevant stakeholders. As the main funder of child care, my Department together with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have a significant interest. I assure the House that my Department would make a submission to such a process and make its expertise available to help achieve an outcome agreeable to all. Much of the €466 million being spent on child care this year is targeted at reducing the cost of child care to parents. However, some measures were designed to target the workforce itself. For example, the higher capitation payment in ECCE was designed to incentivise the employment of graduates. The payment of €75 per child per week is €10.50 higher than the standard rate and was designed to enable services to attract and retain graduates in their service. In 2011, only 8% of services were eligible for this higher payment but this grew to 38% in 2016. Delivering a quality child care system with skilled and qualified carers looking after our children and keeping them safe creates an administrative burden. We cannot allow public money to go to substandard or unsafe services. I am sure we all agree on that. I have also been listening to the concerns of child care providers about red tape and those concerns are genuine. Clearly there is a balance to be struck between ensuring quality and safety while at the same time keeping administration to a manageable limit. As Minister, I have taken a number of initiatives to recognise this workload, which is referred to as non-contact hours. In the past few weeks, I announced an extra €3.5 million in payments to providers who sign up for the extended schemes, starting in September, to recognise this work. This is on top of €14. 5 million in non-contact hour payments announced in the last budget. This funding of €18 million is significant. As the House will be aware, the changes coming in September are leading the way to the new affordable child care scheme. This will amalgamate existing child care schemes into one. The new scheme will cut the administrative burden and I look forward to making further announcements about that in the coming months. There have been changes in community child care recently. New regulations have caused difficulty as a number of community providers moved from a dependency on community employment scheme participants to qualified practitioners. A total of €1 million in payments has commenced to help services through this transition. I want to acknowledge that Deputies from all sides of the House approached me on this issue and I assure them that action has been taken. Obviously, with public money we have a duty to ensure that it is spent effectively and has the desired impact. My Department is working with those providers who have yet to provide the necessary information in order that they have their money as soon as possible. Delivery of a national early years strategy is a priority. When it is published later in the year, the strategy will set out policies and priorities across a wide range of areas for children under the age of six. I can confirm now that these areas will include, but will not be limited to, childhood care and education. It is important to note that the strategy will be the result of a number of consultations with the sector, including an open policy debate at the end of last year. Child care in this country is emerging from a period of huge underinvestment by successive Governments. Getting us back on track was never going to be easy and neither was it going to be solved with a single budget. I mentioned at the outset that in terms of child care we are about to take the first big step. Families will be benefitting within weeks and that is huge. However, more is needed. I have never made a secret of that. I welcome the debate today. The contributions of the Deputies and their support will help strengthen my hand at the negotiating table ahead of the budget. Our goals in child care are ambitious. They have to be. We owe it to the providers, the parents and, above all, our children to continue working towards the goal of genuine, affordable, accessible and quality child care delivered by valued professionals. After taking the first big step, let us make sure there is no going back. I do not take child care professionals for granted.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	445	I thank Deputy Funchion for tabling this motion this evening. I know it is something that both she and Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire have been very passionate about at committee in the months since I was elected. I heard all the Minister had to say and I welcome her response. She is quite right. There has been a gap from Government for a number of years, in particular in the previous five years. I know she is raising it with her colleagues in government. She has brought an emphasis to it and I understand her passion for and understanding of the sector. However, for the rest of us who are not at the Cabinet table and are not part of Government, we do not wish to be personal towards the Minister, Deputy Zappone, but we have to be harsh on the Government's lack of involvement for the last number of years. We have to be harsh in regard to how the Government has not listened to or invested in the sector. This is possibly the first time we have an affordable child care scheme. Unfortunately, it is not up and running for September as would have been the wish of the Minister at the time of the last budget. We support the motion wholeheartedly. I read the motion last week when it was published and there was nothing in it that I could find fault with. It is something my party, Fianna Fáil, and I have been canvassing for, talking about and lobbying for the last number of months and years. It is the sector that looks after our most vulnerable and protects our most precious. I worked in the sector for three years. I was a manager of one of those community crèches. Those are the crèches I feel passionately about. I believe that is the part of the sector that is sellotaped together at the moment. I fear for the future of the community crèches sector, as I do for all child care providers at the moment. It is a sector receiving CPR. It is haemorrhaging the retention and development of child care professionals. Some of them do not see a future, and I will tell the House why. If they are out sick, they only get paid for the three days because that just happens to be the way the employment law stands if someone is out sick more than three days. Therefore, one cannot get sick if one is a child care worker. There is a fear of not being able to borrow, get a car loan or go for a mortgage. Why is that? The simple reason is that they are worried whether they will have a job next September, whether the funding will come through and whether they will have the numbers in the rooms. Those are the questions that the manager of the crèche is worried about. She is worried about the sustainability of her own business, but the staff working in the sector do not know if they have a future from 1 September one year to 1 September the following year. If they are working on temporary contracts from year to year, they do not know whether or not they have a future in the sector. Some of my colleagues are going to talk about what happens when we hit the summer. That is one of the biggest issues. The eight weeks are up now. The centres have all had their graduations. Much of the sector has finished up. Where are the staff now? We all know. Unfortunately, the lack of legislation, the lack of ICT and the breaking of promises have been the cornerstone of the current Administration and the previous Government. They have put the child care sector on the back foot and have left it feeling vulnerable, under-appreciated and under-resourced. When the previous Government hit the rock with the child care sector, it gave it community employment workers. That is what got it out of the pinch and allowed it to afford to keep the community sector going. It gave the sector community employment workers. It allowed it to come under the ratios and it gave community employment workers the opportunity to go into the community crèches to achieve sustainability. That is my opinion. When one does the sums, it is in there as well. Fianna Fáil has been very consistent in its support for the child care sector and has been vocally critical of the Government's continuing failure to invest in the sector. Under this Government, policy in this area has been haphazard and poorly thought out, as shown in the debacle over the single affordable childcare scheme and failings relating to ICT. The Sinn Féin motion seeks an independent early years service cost and sustainability review of the child care sector. Fianna Fáil is entirely supportive of this. Indeed, this work is supposedly happening with the Department. From my questions to the Minister yesterday, I know that we have yet to send it out to tender and there is a timeline for that. The child care sector is still a rapidly changing and dynamic sector and it is crucial that we gain a deeper insight into the sector in order to build better policy. For example, nobody is fully certain regarding the differing costs of child care from infants to toddlers to waddlers to preschoolers. To build on the non-contact and continuing professional development capitation grants paid to providers, we will provide a better professional development fund to aid child care workers in their upskilling. Deputy Ó Laoghaire said earlier that anybody who works in this sector did not join it because they love the money. The money would be one reason not to join the sector. They join the sector because they love children and are passionate about what they are doing. They would like it if they could go on training courses and gain more knowledge to bring it back to the centres, be it through art and crafts or updating their first aid knowledge. Occupational first aid for people within the sector is so expensive but they all want and need to do it. These are the kind of courses they want and they need for funding for it.

In respect of the child care facilities in the not-for-profit community and voluntary sectors that were built over the past number of years, massive work with communities and voluntary organisations and boards is ongoing. Even in the private child care sector, the dedication to duty and commitment on the part of staff is second to none. I have had many interactions with this sector from the time they were being built up to today. We are dealing with an issue through the Minister's office at the moment. I ask her to look at bureaucracy. These people are drawing down funding for projects within the child care facilities and are trying to make every cent stretch to the limit. They are looking at every euro they get from the Department or Pobal and trying to make €2 out of every €1. For one or another reason, there might be an overlap or oversight. The Department and Pobal need to be very careful. They need to look at what might be perceived as but is nowhere near being a conflict of interest within the boards of these child care facilities. Every person on these boards is managing these facilities. I know them very well. They try to make €1 into €2. Deputy Rabbitte referred to Deputy Ó Laoghaire's point that staff do not enter the sector for the money. They do it for love. I have seen the excellent staff there. They have protested outside the gates of this House about funding on numerous occasions over the past three or four years because they feel the sector is not getting the recognition it deserves. It is the foundation stone of how we are going to educate our young people - the next generation and the generations into the future. I ask the Minister to make sure it is not over-bureaucratised. I ask her to make sure that the funding is given in a transparent way, not to come down on the voluntary people because of oversights relating to small issues and to make sure bureaucracy is lifted. We need to recognise, highlight and be more appreciative of the staff who are providing child care throughout this country in the voluntary and private sectors.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	447	As we heard earlier, many staff working in the early childhood education sector will be forced to sign on this week for the duration of the summer. Some even signed on last week. This is due to shorter work contracts and reduced hours of works, with which most workers do not have to contend. As we have heard, wages within this sector do not reflect the work that these heroes do each day. They are heroes who have given this State some service.  High quality early childhood education and care is extremely beneficial to young children and provides a foundation for their education and development. As we all know, early intervention is essential and key for children with complex needs. I will give the example of Sesame Special Needs Preschool in Dungarvan in County Waterford. This is a community play group established especially for children with additional needs and it is the only centre of its kind in west Waterford. This facility caters for 42 children and employs six staff, one of whom is a nurse who works 30 hours per week. The children cared for at Sesame Special Needs Preschool have complex, intellectual special needs so this is a vital service for the children and their families. Each child in this facility is referred by the HSE. However, each child can only attend the centre for three hours, three days a week - a maximum of nine hours - due to a lack of funding. Along with many others, this centre requires extra funding so that it will be able to take on more children for a longer period of time each day. Today I spoke with Eleanor, the manager, and asked her about her wish list. If she had one, what would it be? Her answer was one I am proud to put on the record of the Dáil. She would prefer extra funding to employ more staff so that each child could be offered in excess of the nine hours weekly. This would mean the parents - the full-time carers - could get an extra couple of hours respite. The other wish was that the preschool could offer the service year round but this is not possible due to funding. On Friday, 7 July, the Sesame Special Needs Preschool will close until 4 September. Why? It is not because of the school holidays but because there is not enough funding to pay the staff who will now sign on for a social protection payment when the preschool should be open next week offering these vital services that are required every week. This preschool is funded for 44 weeks per year so for the six weeks for which they are not funded, staff must sign on. Surely the budget is not so restrictive that these children with complex and profound disabilities could not be offered a year-round service. The nurse who works with these children for 30 hours per week is a fantastic young girl but the preschool knows they will lose her because she cannot get a mortgage or a loan to buy a car on 30 hours work per week for 44 weeks of the year. That is the reality. Those three hours respite per day were so important for parents dealing with children with complex needs 24-7. I commend Deputies Function and Ó Laoghaire for bringing such an important motion before the House.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	448	I also welcome and am happy to support this motion. As will be obvious from all the contributions here this evening, there are huge pressures on the child care sector. The sector has developed rapidly since the late 1990s, which is a very welcome development. I know from representing two rural counties that up until that time, there were little or no services in rural Ireland. Thankfully, as Deputy Rabbitte noted, the community child care sector plus the private operators have enlarged capacity hugely and good services are spread throughout the country in both rural and urban Ireland.It is obvious there is a need for increased investment. We need to reduce the cost for parents and we also need to reward the skills, professionalism, care, commitment and diligence of child care workers as well. I am glad the Minister refers to the "child care professionals". Those of us in public life for some years in different roles went to different ceremonies, events and centres and encouraged child care professionals to upskill continually and to pursue FETAC courses and achieve different levels of qualifications. We were encouraging them to do that and it is always on the basis that people should be rewarded for the additional skills and professionalism they bring to their jobs. Sadly, that is not happening. I also want to refer to the comment of Deputy Michael Moynihan with regard to bureaucracy. I spoke to a private child care provider the other evening and she emphasised to me that under no circumstances would she ever compromise on standards but she said we need to take a reality check with regard to some of the regulations and bureaucracy. None of us here wants to see any compromise on standards. We want the proper standards to be adhered to at all times. If we are to develop the sector further we need to reward child care professionals. We need to ensure that community child care is adequately funded by the State as well and that private operators are able to continue to operate as well. The last thing we need to see, particularly in the sparsely-populated areas that I represent, would be the closure of any facility. If that happens, there will not be a new one re-opening.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	449	It is only right that we pay tribute to Deputy Kathleen Funchion and Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire for the very important work coming before this House this evening. As Deputy Anne Rabbitte has already said, we will fully support it. We have been doing much work behind the scenes ourselves on this issue and we know what the problems are. We have a problem and the Minister knows this. The early child education and care spend in this country is 0.5% of GDP. In fact, I would argue that it is 0.4%. I am sure the Minister knows that the EU average is 0.8% to 0.9%. In the Nordic countries, it is 2%. The reality is that there is underinvestment and underspend and that means only one thing. It means low pay, staff turnover at a very high rate and it also means that many of those facilities will find it difficult to stay open. I attended a public meeting last Monday night in Kilbride in County Roscommon. It was a huge meeting and three points came out of it, which were low wages, lack of consultation - a hugely important point - and lack of direct investment. A survey was done at that meeting. Some 43% of those people working in the sector work for 41 weeks or less, therefore they have to sign on for the summer. Some 38% are paid under €10 an hour, and 21% are on €9.25, the minimum wage. That clearly shows there is a problem and the situation is the same around the country. The reason I gave the Minister those figures is because it is extremely important to say that we, the parents, hand over our children from the age of three months to 13 years to those people who have one of the most important jobs in society - I know the Minister is very strong on this herself - to look after and nurture those kids and they do a fantastic job. The reality is that these are very professional people, but they are treated like yellow pack workers. I do not like using that phrase, but many people know what that refers to. We must value those people and we must have increased investment. I say one thing in conclusion. We have not been in power for six years but we had an impeccable record with regard to the community child care service. The Minister referred to this, but I know she did not mean it against just Fianna Fáil. I ask the Minister to check the figures. We did much work when we were in government and we are working now. I would not like to be included as a successive Government that did not do much for the sector.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	450	I want to acknowledge the Minister's own interests and the personal contribution that she has made in this sector in her lifetime. I think that now she can use her position to increase the contribution that she makes to the early years sector and I want to focus, in my two minutes, on the community settings where we as a previous Fianna Fáil Government have a proud track record, because we invested heavily in the physical infrastructure that is now in place right throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, mainly in disadvantaged areas, where the physical infrastructure is there. What we now want to see is that investment carried through to ensure the professional people who are working with children are adequately compensated. The community setting is facing a major challenge with the withdrawal of the community employment, CE, workers. We spoke about this six weeks ago during Parliamentary Questions here. It has to be acknowledged that, for the most part, community settings are located in largely disadvantaged areas. They deal with complex issues and complex cases and they need that additional support. I think what should be looked at from the point of view of the early years setting is that, in our national schools, we have the delivering equality of opportunity, DEIS, band for schools that deal with particular disadvantaged children. We should look at introducing that immediately in the early years setting so that they get the additional supports because they intervene much more. What the Minister should do and look at, which would make a difference to the sector, is that we pay for services for 38 weeks for the free preschool year, but we require the service to pay 42-week staff. We should be paying for the full 42 weeks. That would be a major benefit. We were holding back the capitation rate if a child missed more than ten days in the service. That does not happen in national school and it should not happen in the early years setting and it would benefit the service if the Minister could look at that. There are many challenges in this area. I think and hope the Minister will take on board the many positive contributions coming from across the House this evening and look at resolving the complex issues that face this sector into the future.

I welcome the various groups in the Gallery. I think it is opportune for a number of reasons that we are having this debate now, first because the new scheme is about to come in, described as the more affordable child care scheme. I will come back to that. I know the Minister described it as the first big step in changing Irish child care forever, but there are certain issues around it that I want to come back to. Second, in the context that the Minister also raised, of budgetary preparation, I agree with Deputy Ó Laoghaire that it is much more important that we spend money on services such as child care than for all of the money to go on tax cuts. We feel very strongly in the Labour Party about the importance of spending on services, particularly on a service such as early years care, which has been neglected and which needs a significant injection of funding to bring it up to the kind of averages which are talked about in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD. We fully support investing and we will fully support the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, in fighting for funding for this sector in the budget and I think that is the general view around the House. I want to correct the record a little on our own period in government. Fianna Fáil referred to community child care. The early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, both the first year and second year, was a considerable injection of funds into the sector and has made a very big difference to families. That was done in really tough economic times over the last-----

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	453	I accept that and have just said that. The second one made a big difference when times were extremely difficult. The new bringing together of schemes is important, but it needs to be funded and that is the other point I want to make. In some ways, we have one part of the issue which there has been funding for, which is around the affordability issue for parents, but that obviously has to be stepped up and gradually built on over the years and that is why we developed a five-year funding programme relating to the early years sector. The other side of it is the ability to pay the kind of wages that people in the sector are absolutely entitled to and need. That brings me to the other opportune point, which is that the living wage has been assessed today as being €11.70 per hour. We know that the vast majority of child care workers do not earn anything near that. We did a costing in our alternative budget last year which suggested that we needed to put in €62.6 million just to bring up the wages to the living wage at that time, which is less than the living wage that has been announced today. We need the injection of funding in order to make it more affordable for parents. We also need an injection of funding, and we need to cost it, to ensure that providers can actually afford to pay the wages, whether they are community providers or private providers.The parents cannot afford to pay any more and the money has to come from somewhere. I believe it has to come through a Government injection of funds carefully organised and planned through the recognised sector. I also very much welcome the fact that both SIPTU and IMPACT are involved in campaigning on this because it is important the trade unions get behind the workers in this sector. They have succeeded in other sectors in bringing wages up because of campaigning and involvement. We all have met them and we all have listened to the cases they have made. We definitely need to work altogether on this. I refer to the issue of how people are paid. For example, I was at a meeting in Deputy Brendan Ryan's constituency recently where a woman working in the sector said she would have been paid better in the local supermarket but yet she had a full child care qualification. She had done years in college and yet her wages were less than what she would have got if she worked in the local supermarket. There is something very wrong with that. With hugely committed workers, we cannot just keep saying that. We have to pay them appropriately for the work they do. I believe we need the costing. I note that is in the proposal. I also am aware that Early Childhood Ireland, whose representatives are in the Gallery, did a significant piece of work on how the Minister needs to inject funds. We have much of the information already. We need to start in this year's budget. By all means, then let us have a plan for the future - I note the strategy is coming down the line - but it needs to start with significant funding in the upcoming budget. I do not have much time left and I want to specifically raise some of the issues around the forthcoming more affordable child care scheme. This is an interim measure because the system is not ready for what was originally intended. There is a serious concern among providers that they have not seen a sample contract. The parents themselves are not quite sure how they can apply for the scheme and there is real concern that some providers will say they cannot implement it because they are not ready for it. They do not have the time to implement it. They already have a lot of paperwork to do. I note the Minister stated there is extra funding for contact time, etc., but there is a real burden. There is uncertainty about whether providers can implement the new system that is due to come on stream in September. It would be a shame for parents, but also for the providers and for the children, if we cannot implement this system. The funding, which was provided in the budget, has to be used. The providers have looked for a sample contract, I think, by the end of this week. It is imperative that those who are there to provide the scheme can make it work. I hope the Minister will listen to their concerns also. We need a quality, affordable system. That is very much in the interests of children. All the research and all the experience of those of us who know children, have children or whatever, is that it makes an enormous difference to a child's life if he or she gets a good early start. While we fund the early years of primary school well, this early years sector has been totally neglected over many years. A start has been made. We all need to acknowledge the small amount that has been done but there is a great deal more to do. The only way we will do it is if we cost it and have a multi-annual plan of investment in that sector. It will pay back significantly in terms of the development of individual children, in particular those children who do not have the advantages at home which other children have, but also in terms of society in educational opportunity. Those who work in that sector are really important and deserve to be paid properly. My party will be fully supporting the motion.

A number of us were at a demonstration six weeks ago outside the gates of this House organised by SIPTU on a significant day - International Children's Day. Obviously, the protest was about child care and the poor pay and conditions that workers face. Not only are poor pay and conditions a problem in child care, but so too is staff retention. As other Deputies have said, it seems incredible that we have 22,000 people looking after our children who are very badly paid. There is something fundamentally wrong with that model. Ireland has one of the most expensive child care systems in the OECD. It is the most expensive with the least subsidies and a workforce that is badly paid. Obviously, there are parallels between what is going on in child care and the health care system. There is pay apartheid in the health care system. As Deputies have said, there is this mystical Nordic child care plan that we all aspire to. The nearest we get to Nordic child care in Ireland is if we go to IKEA and leave our children in the crèche there. The facts speak for themselves. In Ireland, we spend 0.5% of GDP. If one wants a Nordic child care system, one must spend 2% of GDP on child care. It is a lack of investment that has led to this debate on poor pay and conditions for staff. I think the Minister will admit that there is a genuine crisis in the child care system in this country. When I was investigating this and doing a bit of research, I found there is a bewildering array of child care schemes. I understand the Minister is trying to amalgamate them. There is the community childcare subvention programme, the after-school childcare scheme, the childcare education and training support programme and the early childhood care and education scheme. I welcome the fact the Minister is introducing a new scheme, a single affordable child care scheme with a universal subsidy, to replace the other schemes. I hope I am correct in that.  Currently, we have over 4,000 child care service providers, between community and private for profit. I really welcome that this motion shines a light on those who look after our children. Obviously, they want to be as committed as possible to their work. We should aspire to the Nordic model. If we do not give subvention to child care, it will have a knock-on effect on the workers and also on the quality of child care. Child care is an invaluable form of looking after our children and society as a whole.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	455	I welcome those child care workers, trade unionists and campaigners for decent pay and conditions who are in the Visitors Gallery and who are watching on television screens around the country. I want to indicate that we, on these benches, will be supporting the Sinn Féin motion when the votes are taken. The average hourly rate of pay for a child care assistant in the State is €10.27 per hour. That is doubly a scandal, given the importance of the work that is being done by these workers. These workers have invariably spent very significant sums of money, running to thousands of euro, putting themselves through college and getting the training and qualifications for the work and yet multiple indignities are heaped on them. Of course, many of them are forced to sign on the dole during the months of July and August. They have no choice in that matter. Professional workers deserve professional pay.One Deputy mentioned that the rate for the living wage is €11.70 as of this week. No child care professional in this State should earn less than that. I note with interest the reference in the Minister's speech to an approach involving a central employment order through either the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court. The Minister assured the House that her Department would make a submission to such a process. Those words should serve as a green light for trade unions and in particular for child care workers to flood into the unions in this country in vast numbers, linking the demand for sectoral employment orders with a decent rate of pay. I want to bring before the House a case relating to the summer scheme at the Before 5 Nursery and Family Centre in Churchfield, Cork. I wish to highlight part of the Minister's speech. She stated:There have been changes in community child care recently. New regulations have caused difficulty as a number of community providers moved from a dependency on community employment scheme participants to qualified practitioners. A total of €1 million in payments has commenced to help services through this transition. I want to acknowledge that Deputies from all sides of the House approached me on this issue and I assure them that action has been taken.The word from the grassroots in communities is that action is not being taken. The Before 5 Nursery and Family Centre in Churchfield, Cork, is an after-school arrangement that caters for 33 families. There are 28 children there on a daily basis. Many of those children would have no holidays whatsoever were it not for the scheme. Activities include going to the beach or the local five-a-side centre, painting in the centre and so on for four days per week for four weeks, yet that arrangement had to be collapsed this year because the resources are not in place. After-school services are not properly funded. The changes in the community employment childcare programme came from the Department of Social Protection four years ago. The number of CE staff in the centre in Cork is down from four to one. Nothing has been put in place to replace the programme or to make arrangements for the summer holidays for children from those families from this working class community in my constituency. I do not think that is the only summer scheme facing that situation this summer. There needs to be action. The words do not match the reality. Action is not being taken. There needs to be progress on this immediately.

I will be succinct in what I have to say. I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this Private Members' Bill today. It is certainly at an opportune moment especially given what has been said about workers in the childcare sector, many of whom are facing a period on the dole from this week. We know what the issues are and I am not going to go through them again. The sector has been starved of money. Money was put into the community sector, but not enough. Then, there was considerable reliance on the private sector but vast amounts of money are needed. A parent is almost paying a second mortgage for child care and crèche costs. That is not necessarily the fault of those running the childcare facilities. Other factors include health and safety and all the regulation that goes with it. Then there is the matter of paying staff, although the pay is not great. What really struck me from the Minister's speech was the point about sectoral arrangements and the Workplace Relations Commission. It highlights one thing to me in this sector. I was at a meeting yesterday of English language teachers, another sector of teaching where the same situation arises. They are on fixed-term contracts. They do not get paid for holidays or sick pay. They are trying to get union representation. The sectoral issue was raised in the context of the employment order. We were informed that a union has to have a given number of members before an order can be made. I endorse the call by Deputy Mick Barry for everyone in the sector to join a union and demand the sectoral employment order. That is how they will achieve it or win it. It is important for that to happen. Without that voice they will not get it. If the Minister is saying that the Department would support it, then Deputies in the Dáil would support it also. This area has to be addressed. It is an important sector. We all know that. It is relevant for the professionals who work in the sector and run it. Parents expect professional education and care for their children. I hope we will not be sitting here for the next two years. There will always be a problem with child care, but at the end of the day I support Deputies who have said that the sector requires significant investment. It is a public service that should be paid for. I particularly agree with the call in the Sinn Féin motion on the Government to carry out, as a matter of urgency, an independent early years service cost and sustainability review. I am unsure of the Minister's position. Does she support it? We need to look at what the costs are and then we can move to where we need to go.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	457	I thank Deputy Kathleen Funchion for bringing forward this debate tonight. It comes after the recent exchange of questions on child care. We all agree on the importance of early childhood education. All children should have education, care and support in a safe nurturing environment. Children in disadvantaged areas have additional needs and they present further challenges. I want to make a special case for community child care because these are the children in communities of greatest need. A survey was done of a number of community child care services. The survey found that 34% of the children attending were from a lone-parent background, a figure twice the national average. Some 35% are from a household where no adult is working. Again, that figure is twice the national average. The survey found that 16% attending had English as a second language. In Dublin Central the figure is far higher. The services are also taking referrals from Tusla and public health nurses. Moreover, they make referrals onto other services. I am making the case that they have additional needs and challenges. I believe there should be positive discrimination towards those areas of greatest need. If we do not make a real difference in the early years, then those children will be playing catch-up for the rest of their childhood. They will be at a disadvantage going into primary school. That makes it very difficult for them when they get to second level. My constituency has some excellent community child care services. Those involved are coping and working to address the challenges. Of course, in Dublin Central those challenges have been added to in the past year by the number of murders as well as the violence and anti-social behaviour. Our children are going to the community child care services and schools. They have had murders on their streets. The Garda armed response unit is an almost daily vision that they see on their way here and there. Members of their families have been shot. That is what the community child care services and the schools are dealing with. The pay does not match those responsibilities. Kieran Mulvey's report recognises that this cohort of people working in preschool child care, primary and post-primary schools are working hard to provide stability and security for children. We need to get early years community care right. We need to get the right staff with qualifications in place; they have a unique role. We know the scheme enables those in unemployment to get into the labour market, because quality child care is available. The Minister referenced €1 million in funding for community child care for those having difficulty meeting the regulatory requirements due to change, especially those who are relying on CE schemes. We need to look at that. The Minister said it is making a difference, but we need more detail on those services where it is not making a difference. I understand the reasoning behind the changes. We all agree on the need for quality and recognised qualifications that are at least FETAC level 5. However, it would be good to look at the possibility of a grandfather clause. Reference was made to DEIS status. Such an arrangement could tide those community child care settings over while the staff are being trained. Some of them are approaching the end of that training. The pay issue is relevant. The reports and the evidence are available. Low pay is a fact for those working in the sector, especially those in the community sector. We are seeing an increase in the part-time employment and 38-week contracts. They have been referred to as well. The wages do not reflect the qualifications. Also, the setting does not incentivise those working in child care to move towards further qualifications.I like the BA degree course in early childhood care which is provided part time in the National College of Ireland because it recognises prior experiential learning, such that experience and relevant work count as basic qualifications.  There are higher costs in providing child care in urban settings. The Minister mentioned an independent review of quality child care. The information provided for Deputies by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service references the many reports already produced in this area, including a number last year, including a departmental survey, an early years profile, a national skills bulletin, an ICTU report, not to mention previous reports and surveys. I wonder, therefore, about the necessity for another report. We all know what needs to be done; we just need to do it. Will the recommendations made in the Early Childhood Ireland report be implemented?

I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this Private Members' motion on the important issue of child care provision and costs. As rightly highlighted, issues such as pay, public and private service provision and the cost of child care have up until now been brushed under the table, particularly by the previous Government. The people who provide private and public child care services are dedicated to the job. They would not do it if they did not enjoy caring for young children. From my point of view, the biggest problem facing us in this area is that of striking a balance between providing child care and providing the service at an affordable cost. Young couples are struggling with child care costs which are akin to having a second mortgage. There are many young people in this and other cities who are struggling to meet mortgage repayments and child care costs. It is impossible. Sinn Féin is correct to use its Private Members' time to have a debate on the subject. I listened in my office to the Minister's contribution. I agree with other Members that her heart is in the right place and that she is coming to this issue a little late in that there has been a lot of neglect in this area up until now, but I appreciate her strong interest in the matter. I hope that in having this debate we will arrive at a solution. We do not want those involved in the sector to be underpaid. We do not want those providing child care to be second-class citizens. We want their work and effort to be as valued as the work and effort of others in other sections of society. While I do not wish to single out anybody, I compliment one particular group in this area, namely, those who have set up crèches or child care facilities and are struggling to pay rates and public liability insurance. They face the same challenges as any small business, while at the same time providing safe and secure care for the young children in their charge. All parents know that one of the biggest responsibilities of a parent is caring for and minding a child. Caring for the children of others is a serious operation.  It is important to highlight the problems in the sector. Many Deputies have made very valuable contributions. It is welcome that Sinn Féin has the support of Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and others, including the Minister, on this issue. It is important that we address the problems in this area and that we ensure private and public service providers are properly paid and that child care is affordable for the struggling young families who are strapped financially.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	459	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion and take the opportunity to offer my sympathy to the Minister on her recent sad loss. Yesterday I received an email about this issue, in which I was informed that Ireland spent only 0.5% of GDP on early childhood education and child care, which is well below the EU average of 0.8% and the 2% of GDP invested by the Nordic countries in this area. I received another email from Private Early Education Providers, PEEP, the national representative body for private child care providers, which stated some of its members would be forced not to offer the new Government designed affordable child care scheme owing to a lack of information on how it would be implemented and insufficient funding for the management and provision of the scheme. According to PEEP, while the scheme is due to be rolled out in September, parents appear to be unaware of it and child care providers have yet to see a copy of the contract they are expected to sign to deliver the programme, which is outrageous. We heard earlier about issues to do with special needs assistants, although the Taoiseach clarified that the matter was discussed by the Cabinet today. It is not good enough that parents and providers are being kept in the dark. Despite repeated requests to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, vital information on conditions for providers who will deliver the scheme is not forthcoming. This, too, is not good enough. The people concerned are public servants and should be treated as such and given the information they need on the provision of this service. We all support the call for improved working conditions for those who work in this vitally important sector.  As we know, the consequences of under-investment are all too familiar. Pay is low for educators; staff turnover is high and services are struggling to remain open. I was chairperson and a founding member of a naíonra in my village. I also served on its board for a number of years. I understand having to live from day to day and week to week is not good enough as it undermines efforts to ensure the provision of high-quality care for children.  Another aspect of the debate that does not receive enough attention is that the fundamental issue with many of the Government’s child care proposals is that very often they represent an attack on parents who do not want to seek paid work because one or other wants to mind the children at home. Long before we had any of these schemes one parent remained at home to care for a child or children. The view is that parents who wish to mind their children at home are placing them at a developmental disadvantage. Nothing could be further from the truth. We need to challenge much of the so-called evidence that children over the age of one year have better outcomes in day care than they do at home.  I will conclude with the following quote taken from a UNICEF report: Notwithstanding the evidence, the amount of time spent in centre-based care must be considered. Evidence suggests that prolonged periods in centre based care can have a negative impact on children’s outcomes, particularly for younger children. Nowhere does the report seem to contemplate just how radical it is to say children are actually better off being cared for by someone other than their own parents. The aim should be to ensure as many children as possible are cared for at home. The report also does not honestly face up to the fact that many of its proposals are a blow to stay-at-home parents. We need stay-at-home parents. We are all about choice and equality. If parents choose to remain at home to care for a child or children, they should be supported in doing so.  I accept that the Minister is fairly new to the portfolio, but I appeal to her to direct her officials to provide the information requested. It is not fair that parents and providers do not have it. As in the case of SNAs and the Taoiseach's statement this morning that we will never again have to wait until July for it to be announced, parents and service providers need the information now. They are doing the State a service. They earn a pittance and need to be supported. Above all else, they need to be given the information requested.

I commend Deputy Kathleen Funchion for taking this initiative. The Social Democrats fully support this motion. We have always known the first five years in a person's life are the most important. It is the time when the future emotional, social and educational well-being of a person is laid down. However, when it comes to Government investment, children always seem to be the last in line. As a result, we have one of the most underfunded and underdeveloped child care systems in the European Union. UNICEF’s international benchmark for investment in early years education is 1% of GDP. We spend just 0.5% below the average for OECD countries and just 25% of the European average investment in early years services. We are nowhere near the 1.8% of GDP spent in Iceland, the 1.6% spent in Sweden or the 1.4% invested in Denmark. As a result of this chronic underfunding, we now have a service that is highly inconsistent and a sector that is verging on a staffing crisis. We have all seen the recent survey from Early Childhood Ireland that showed 86% of its respondents are concerned that difficulties recruiting and retaining staff will impact on the viability of its services. Some 36% of those who tried to recruit staff in the past 12 months were unable to find anyone suitable. Most concerning of all, however, is that 46% of those who they managed to recruit had to settle for someone with lower qualifications than they would have wanted. That is not surprising. Despite the fact this is a well qualified workforce, with a minimum qualification of a level 5 Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI award, they are earning below the living wage and working in incredibly precarious conditions. Among the estimated 22,000 workers in this sector, many are employed for just 15 hours a week or on contract for only 39 weeks in a year, forcing thousands of trained workers to sign on to social welfare each summer. That is no way to treat an essential workforce, and it is no wonder that the sector has a staff turnover rate of almost 30%. The motion before the House aims to create an employment regime that reflects the level of professionalism and educational attainment that we expect from those entrusted with the care of our children. If that is the aim, it is critical that child care workers organise and join a union and ensure they achieve their basic rights as workers. The current system is completely unacceptable and there is a clear need for the introduction of professional pay scales, continuous professional development, and paid non-contract time. However, we also need to know what it is actually costing to run a quality service which can appropriately remunerate its staff. In the absence of the sort of robust cost review called for by Early Childhood Ireland, it is hard to see the basis on which the Government is making its policy decisions. This is evident in the approaching roll-out of the affordable child care scheme. Other speakers have quoted what the private early education providers have said regarding the lack of information on contracts. Fundamentally, it indicates a lack of respect for those who will be providing the service. This needs to end. If we are to ensure the quality of care we expect this sector to provide, then the Government needs to take action and provide for decent pay and fair working conditions in this most important sector.

I compliment Deputy Kathleen Funchion on bringing forward this Private Members' motion. She is very well briefed and has a very good understanding of the service. I will be supporting this motion. I have been involved in this area for the past 15 years as a board member of a community child care centre and I know the service has been historically underfunded and under pressure on a daily, and an hourly, basis.  It is very important to compliment the staff of the child care facilities who work above and beyond the call of duty on a daily basis and who have a huge personal commitment. They provide a professional, quality service. They upskill themselves at their own expense. They are involved very flexibly in the running of centres, coming in early, going home late and so on. Without the commitment of the staff in the centres, there is no doubt many services would be closed by now. Many staff have suffered pay cuts or a cut in their hours in recent years and some people have lost their jobs. As was mentioned earlier, many will sign on for social welfare in the summer months and some will not even qualify for payments. I welcome the involvement of IMPACT and SIPTU trade unions in this area because proper pay and conditions of employment is a must for staff and for the provision of a quality child care service. To do that, there must be proper State funding of the service to OECD levels.

Any Deputy who attended the meetings held around the country will be aware that three issues emerged, namely, investment, wages and consultation. The first message we got was that the workers felt they were not being listened to and that they were not at the table able to talk to the people who mattered. That was a major concern. The second issue was of investment. Considerable investment went into the building of community crèches throughout the country down through the years, but they need investment year in, year out to replace items and to carry out necessary work, but that has not happened. The third issue was wages. It was pointed out that a person in this sector, having gone to college to get a degree, would be paid more per hour working in a local shop. Those of us who are parents of young children drop our children off at a private or a public crèche in the morning and we trust the person running that crèche. That person could be a mother who got her own children out that morning, went to the crèche to mind other people's children and then goes to college at night to further her education. That must be respected. If we do not respect these people, we will lose them. The paperwork involved in running crèches needs to be cut down. I attended one of those meetings one night and there were almost 10 yd of paperwork on the different things one must do to ensure one qualifies for the different grants. People do not have time for that, and that needs to be sorted. Many people running private crèches during the bad times paid the mortgage but they had no wages for themselves. No one will claim we can solve this matter overnight, but I ask the Minister to give the people in this sector a roadmap for the next two, three or four years to let them know where they are going and, above all, to believe in where they are going.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	463	As has been said a number of times, there is an estimated 22,000 staff in the early childhood education and care sector in this State. Their job is an incredibly important one. Parents place their trust in them to look after and aid the development of their young children. Their worth is acknowledged by many but not by all. There is little doubt but that the Government has failed at least to date to recognise the contribution they make, as it has failed to address the wholly inadequate pay rates experienced by those working in this sector. It is no exaggeration to say that these workers have been and continue to be exploited. The average wage of a child care worker falls significantly below the living wage and does not reflect their qualifications. Thousands of them are on a 38-week contract which means that during the summer period they will be left with no other option but to go on social welfare. Is it any wonder that community and private child care services are struggling to retain, let alone recruit, staff? It comes as no surprise that evidence shows that early childhood education is crucial for children at the foundation stage of their development. It is also no secret that the improvement of working conditions and salaries will not only benefit those working in the sector but will also be to the advantage of the children. It is in all our interests to ensure that the situation is improved and that our children have the best possible start in their lives. It is high time the Government properly recognised the valuable contribution of early years sector, as distinct from fine words and faint praise that we have heard all too often.Their contribution to Irish society in providing early education and care for the youngest of Irish citizens should no longer be dismissed. We spend significantly less on early years education, at 0.5% of gross domestic product, against the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 0.7% and even less than the international benchmark of 1%. Investment is needed to bring us into line with other countries. Another issue of concern that has recently been brought to my attention pertaining to child care is the difficulty experienced by parents in securing the necessary supports in preschools for their children with special needs. In my constitutency of Cavan-Monaghan five new places were granted for young children under the HSE preschool support worker grants scheme - three children in Cavan and two in Monaghan. I am aware of a case in which a child with special needs has been refused support and there is, therefore, a strong possibility that she will be unable to take up her place in her playschool. That is so wrong. In response to a parliamentary question I submitted on the matter, I was informed that, alongside the HSE preschool support worker grants scheme, a service was provided as part of the access and inclusion model for which parents could apply. However, when I looked at the scheme, what I discovered and what the answer to the parliamentary question failed to mention was the fact that “finally, it should be noted that the access and inclusion model will take three to five years to fully embed as multi-annual educational and training programmes are rolled out and capacity is built up in the system. The HSE does, on an ad hoc basis, make some supports available and these arrangements will continue while the new model is being established”. The model only got going in September 2016. I have submitted a further parliamentary question asking how many children have accessed supports through the access and inclusion model seeing that the HSE can provide some supports "on an ad hoc basis". I await the Minister’s response with interest. I would also appreciate it if she could look into the matter in a more substantial way than the responses to parliamentary questions often suggest. No child should be denied a place in a preschool because he or she is differently abled, a point I emphasise.  I sincerely hope all Teachtaí will support this important motion. I commend my colleagues for their initiative in bringing it forward.

I commend my colleague, Deputy Kathleen Funchion, for bringing forward the motion. It is important to recognise the great work child care providers do in highlighting and fixing the problems facing the sector, in which wage levels are a serious problem. They do not match the qualifications and experience of those providing excellent child care services. Businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to attract and retain graduates as better wages are available in other industries and countries. Many child care professionals are on the minimum wage of €9.25 which is kept too low by the Government, while many child care providers cannot raise wages as the subsides paid under child care schemes are inadequate. The cost of child care in Ireland prevents many people from taking up work. I had a constituent in my Limerick office this week with this exact problem. She could not access child care to go out to work. Although programmes such as the early childhood care and education scheme are most welcome, this particular scheme only provides for three hours of subsidised education a day, leaving a huge cost to parents who need child care services for the full working day.  We have a low minimum wage. More than 35% of all workers in Ireland are paid €400 or less per week. How can they realistically afford child care on top of other huge costs such as rent and transport? The issue of unpaid administrative work is also of concern for child care professionals. I know providers who after a long day of minding and educating children have to go home and in their own time gather large amounts of information from parents and input it online and onto databases. All of this work goes unnoticed and is unpaid. The extension of the affordable child care scheme will only add to it.  Ireland spends significantly less on early years education, at half of the international benchmark of 1% of GDP. More investment would lead to increased standards in the care and education of our youngest citizens and help to improve conditions for professionals in the sector. Sinn Féin's motion calls on the Government to address the issue of low pay in the sector, remedy the problem of unpaid non-contact work and invest more in the early years education and care sector to improve conditions for workers, children and their parents.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	465	I welcome the opportunity to speak about this important issue and commend my colleagues, Deputies Kathleen Funchion and Donnchadh Ó Laoighaire, for their work on the early years sector. They have been to the fore in highlighting issues of concern in it. I also welcome those in the Visitors Gallery who represent the people affected by the issues raised in the debate. I know that there are many more tuned in to watch the proceedings. There is a growing staff crisis in the early years sector. The ever increasing burden of administration work on staff without adequate time, pay or resources is causing a huge staff turnover and a shortage of skilled workers. Thousands of staff in the sector are forced to sign on every year for the summer months, despite many of them holding professional qualifications at degree level. That is an insult to these workers who work very hard. Despite the fact that the Government is demanding higher professional standards from early years services, the level of funding provided does not match these aspirations. In fact, there is little to incentivise highly qualified degree level workers to enter the sector for minimum wage rates and with limited career prospects. The vision for the future for the sector is central to the debate. Do we see it essentially as providing a child care service or do we see it as an extension of the education system? International research shows that high quality early childhood care and education is beneficial to young children at the foundation stage of their development. As a teacher by profession, I am only too aware of the critical impact of early years education, particularly for children who experience disadvantage. The international benchmark for expenditure on the early years sector is 1% of GDP, but the State only spends half of that amount. That says it all and I hope Deputies will give the sector the respect it deserves by supporting the motion. We need to value staff in the early years sector. This is the time to show them how much we value their work.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	466	On behalf of the Minister, I encourage all parents of children with disabilities to apply for the access and inclusion model, AIM, supports to which the Deputy referred. It is important that we get the message out to the parents of preschool children with disabilities that they ought to apply under the access and inclusion model. To date, more than 2,500 children have received supports under the scheme, but I suspect not everyone is aware of it and want to get that message across. The three to five year timeframe to which the Deputy referred covers the time required to ensure the staff of all services will have attended special training in inclusion which is being rolled out by the Department.  There was a reference to contracts and the assertion made by child care providers that contracts were not available. Contracts have been available to all providers since mid-May. The contracts reference two supplemental publications, the programme rules and the financial guidelines. The rules for the scheme are being rewritten to provide for greater clarity and certainty, based on feedback from the sector. There are no fundamental changes to the rules for the scheme from those currently publicly available. It is expected that the revised, clearer rules will be published in the next couple of weeks.  There was a question about the payment of €14.5 million for non-contact time. Deputies have asked when this sum will be paid. To date, 2,509 facilities have submitted the non-contact application form. That represents approximately 60% of those eligible for the funding. They will be paid in the coming days and we encourage the remaining 40% of providers to apply as soon as possible.  I thank everyone who has spoken about this matter. It has been a valuable debate.I am encouraged the discussion on the challenges faced in early years care and education is seen as a matter worthy of our attention. Many important points were raised by Deputies and in considering the debate as a whole I was struck by the general level of agreement across a range of topics. We all agree investment is required to move forward and that the sector requires a valued, motivated and suitably educated workforce to deliver quality services to our children. These are among the important matters we will raise with Cabinet colleagues in the context of the future Estimates discussions. There has been a clear focus throughout our discussion on the matter of pay and conditions. This is reflective of conversations I and my officials have had with over 1,000 providers and practitioners in recent weeks and months throughout the country. Some measures have been taken to assist employers with pay costs, such as the higher capitation payment mentioned in the opening address and the €18 million in non-contact time payments to be made available this year, but I appreciate that the underlying funding model needs review. It is my strong view that appropriate terms and conditions for the workforce are critical to our aim of building a sustainable infrastructure of accessible, high-quality and affordable child care in Ireland. We must ensure our investment is targeted at both quality and affordability. As a Minister of State, I am committed to addressing both simultaneously. The independent review of the cost of providing child care in Ireland, which will be commissioned in the coming weeks, will assist greatly in providing independent and objective evidence to inform future policy. Should trade unions and other representative bodies in the sector advance a sectoral employment order, my officials will assist with any submissions required for the process. If such a process concludes and reaches a point where recommendations are made to the Labour Court, I would be a strong advocate for appropriate investment. Along with the issue of pay, I recognise that sustainability of services remains an issue. We mentioned earlier the €1 million that has been made available to child care services to help replace unqualified community employment scheme workers and the continued work of my officials to better understand the specifics of the challenges that certain providers face. Learning from these interactions is informing policy in this area. The more affordable child care measures being introduced this September and the affordable child care scheme, which I will mention again momentarily, will both make a significant contribution to improving sustainability. Both will reduce the co-payment required from parents, as that co-payment on occasions to date proved too onerous for some families, resulting in services failing to recoup it. The income from these measures will be a reliable income and demand for child care services should increase, allowing services to expand and remain in full operation over summer months, as out-of-school demand grows for school-age children. Since the Minister's appointment, a priority has been to meet early years care providers directly, as well as making individual visits to services and meetings with various organisations. She established the early years forum to provide for a structured engagement with the sector and she is delighted to chair quarterly meetings with the forum. I hope this improves communications and helps all of us to focus on solutions. Recent nationwide information events carried out by departmental officials were attended by people from over 1,000 providers, giving an opportunity for officials to inform the sector directly about forthcoming change and also to listen to concerns of the sector. The sector is unrecognisable from what existed ten years ago and it is still developing and changing. I pay tribute to the sector for its engagement with this development and change, as there has been a constructive partnership with the Department on this journey. In concluding my contribution to this evening's debate, I will take some time to speak about the ongoing development of the affordable child care scheme, the single most fundamental reform undertaken in child care in a considerable time. I will highlight a number of recent positive developments. Reform of our traditional system of delivering child care supports is much-needed and there are currently five different child care funding programmes. There is one universal programme, the early childhood care and education programme, and four targeted programmes. Those targeted programmes are community child care subvention, child care education and training support, after-school child care and community employment child care programmes. The four targeted funding programmes are administratively complex and inadequate in terms of accessibility. They vary widely in terms of access and eligibility criteria, as well as rates and levels of support. For example, in budget 2017, the Government provided funding for the development of a new single affordable child care scheme that would merge and reform the four targeted schemes. This new scheme will provide an infrastructure from which future investment in child care may be administered. The Minister was delighted to negotiate additional funding of €19 million for the development and implementation of the affordable child care scheme. That scheme will be introduced at the earliest possible date and in the meantime a very significant step will be taken from September 2017 to make child care more affordable for thousands of families throughout Ireland by making a number of enhancements to the existing targeted funding programmes. These enhancements include, for the first time, the payment of universal child care subsidies for children aged from six months until commencement in the early childhood care and education programme. Targeted child care subsidies will also increase significantly, some by 50%. The affordable child care scheme and the September measures are good news for children and families but they also represent good news for providers, as they will lead to increased and more reliable income. The access and inclusion model was launched in June 2016 to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme. The aim of the model is to support early years settings in delivering an inclusive preschool experience, ensuring that every eligible child can fully participate in the ECCE programme and reap the benefits of quality preschool education. The access and inclusion model is child-centred and it involves seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted based on the strengths and needs of the child and early years setting. Applications for the access and inclusion supports have been accepted since June 2016 and 2,892 children across 1,390 early years settings have been supported through targeted supports. It is envisaged that universal and inclusion model supports have reached even greater numbers of children and early years settings. As we continue to roll out the scheme over the next two years, my officials are committed to hearing feedback from providers and parents as to how the scheme can be further improved. A number of other recent significant developments in child care have been designed to address matters of affordability, accessibility and quality. These initiatives include expansion of the ECCE programme so children, parents and providers would benefit from an average of 61 weeks in the programme, as opposed to the original 38 weeks. This increased the number of children benefiting in April this year to 120,00, up from 67,000 in 2016. The introduction of the 2016 child care regulations are designed to underpin quality service provision. There was the introduction of learner funds and a graduate bursary to support the upskilling of the early years work force. There was also the introduction of the national early years quality support service, Better Start, and mentoring and support resources for early years services. We have seen the appointment of national Síolta and Aistear co-ordinators to work with 55 mentors across the country to support upskilling of the workforce and the introduction of an early years inspection function within the Department of Education and Skills, as well as enhancement of the Tusla inspectorate. All these are important initiatives designed to improve quality, affordability and access. A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a significant number of commitments related to access to high-quality and affordable child care. The Minister is committed to seeing these through to fruition. Many steps have been taken and we must acknowledge these but more action and investment is undoubtedly required. I thank Members for their contributions on this important subject, which is very dear to the Minister, both professionally and personally.

Níl dabht ar bith gur cheist fíor-thábhachtach é do leanaí agus do dhaoine óga, ach go háirithe dóibh siúd atá ag obair san earnáil seo.

Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sí ag dul timpeall an Stáit ag plé le daoine atá ag obair san earnáil agus í ag cur tuairisc le chéile. Despite years of inaction, not just by this Government but successive Governments, it comes as no surprise to this House that the early years education sector is in somewhat of a crisis. Those working in the sector are and have for years been subject to poor pay and inadequate working conditions. This is despite the fact they undertake what is arguably one of the most important functions in our society, being charged with caring for the well-being of children. As I stated, I had the pleasure of working with Deputy Funchion in meeting a number of child care workers and representatives from across my county of Donegal. It was a very worthwhile and engaging experience. I could not but be impressed by their professionalism, skill and dedication to the work but I was dismayed and saddened to hear of the challenges they face while doing their job, which they love and about which they are passionate. That was very clear as we sat in the room and heard woman after woman - most of them were women, although there were some males - explaining their daily experiences and challenges. There was a lack of recognition of the role they play in society as the carers of children at a very young and vulnerable age.The absence of agreed pay scales and adequate funding provisions means that the sector is plagued by a high staff turnover, a skills shortage and varying standards across the industry. The motion seeks to change all of that by seeking to recognise the vital work done to ensure the sector is one which meets the highest standards in the quality of care provided. Above all else, it seeks to treat the 22,000 child care professionals working in the sector with the respect and fairness they so thoroughly deserve in educating and caring for our youngest citizens. Molaim an rún seo chuig an Teach. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Funchion arís as ucht é a chur os comhair an Tí anocht.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	472	I extend my sincerest sympathy and condolences to the Minister, Teachta Katherine Zappone, on the recent loss of her wife, Ann Louise Gilligan, whose contribution to Irish life was very significant and noteworthy. I did not know her very well, but I have to say that on the occasions I met her, even if it was only for seconds, I always felt better after meeting her. Táimid leis an Aire ag an uair dheacair seo dá saol agus tá mo chomhbhrón agus comhbhrón Shinn Féin léi fosta. Ba mhaith liom an rún seo os ár gcomhair a mholadh. Tá mo bhuíochas ag dul do Teachta Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire as ucht é a chur faoi bhráid na Dála. Tá mé buíoch fosta den Teachta Kathleen Funchion fá choinne an obair a rinne sí ar an ábhar seo. This is a very important motion which I hope all Teachtaí will support. It calls on the Government to immediately address the issue of the extra administrative requirements which will be added to providers owing to the extension of the affordable child care scheme.  I recently met representatives of the Cox's Demense Youth and Community Project which does fantastic work with children and young people. Cox's Demense is a very disadvantaged area and the people who work in the scheme and many other volunteers do so through an after school service, a family support hub, a teen parents support programme, training schemes and the Garda youth diversion project. They have identified major concerns with the affordable child care scheme which they believe will impact negatively on their ability to offer after school services. They were not consulted and their opinions were not sought which I am sure was not the intention of the Minister. Those involved in the Cox's Demense project have come together with those involved in four other community projects in County Louth which share the same concerns, namely, Lios na nÓg, Hidden Treasures, Muirhevnamor Community Youth Project and the Moneymore after school club. They have produced a document which I have sent to the Minister. I hope she will have time to consider it. The major problem is that the affordable child care scheme will not cover children who currently avail of after school services. I am sure the Minister recognises from her own work and life experiences the value of these projects which act as early intervention mechanisms, especially for children who are at risk and might not have another adult to whom to turn. If that is not changed, the services will close. I have met quite a few of the young people involved and they are vulnerable. They are from dysfunctional families and so on. We need to make sure we cherish them all.  Ba mhaith liom an rún seo a mholadh chuig an Dáil agus iarraim ar achan Teachta tacú leis.

It is heartening that so many understand the issues facing the sector. It was important for us to have the debate to highlight the issues, but it is even more important for us to take action. Time and again, we have a tendency to come into the Chamber or other rooms in Leinster House to talk about an issue or a crisis and then go away and do nothing about it. I sincerely hope the proposals made in our motion will be supported and followed through. I welcome many of the Minister's comments, particularly on meeting child care workers, workers in the early years sector and the unions. Her acknowledgement of the need for a sectoral employment order shows that she knows that there is a crisis in the sector and that working conditions are not good enough. However, I do not believe - I used to work for a union - that we should have to wait for a sectoral employment order. If the Minister knows that the issues need to be addressed, we should address them in the House. All Deputies were supportive of the motion and acknowledged the fact that workers in the sector needed to be valued and paid correctly; therefore, we should examine our motion. On pay and conditions, the Minister said new approaches and thinking outside the box were required. That is welcome and exactly what we should do. In that regard, we need an independent early years service cost and sustainability review. There is no reason the Members of this House cannot decide to commission the development of nationally agreed pay scales for the early years workforce and provide the necessary funding for it.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	474	We believe there is a need to end the class bias within the Judiciary. It is deep rooted and will not be resolved by the Bill. It will make very small inroads into removing the more blatant elements of the making of political appointments to the Judiciary, but that is only a very small part of the issue. I read a comment somewhere which asked if the Bill was necessary. It was suggested political appointees were not a problem in the Judiciary. The point was made that the differences in judgments made by Fianna Fáil appointed and connected judges and those made by Fine Gael appointed and connected judges were analysed and that no differences were found in the judgments. I thought that dramatically missed the point. The point is not that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael do not disagree with each other because they do not generally disagree with each other on substantial points, even here, but that political parties, establishment political parties in particular, are vastly over-represented among the Judiciary. A study conducted in 2011 found that one in three of the judges surveyed had direct or indirect connections with political parties, a figure which is wildly out of step with that for the rest of society.I make particular reference to the contribution made by Deputy Darragh O'Brien who stated:The recent Jobstown trial in one of our courts, which I am allowed to comment on, was presided over by a judge. This is relevant to the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017. During that trial members of Solidarity-People Before Profit said publicly and in meetings held across the country and, in particular, in Dublin that they believed the jury selection was unfair, unconstitutional and illegal. They questioned the independence and relevance of the jury. They held public meetings all over the city and big posters were put up throughout Dublin to say that it was an unfair jury selection. They said that it was going to be a big divvy up and that there was a conspiracy in our courts and our judicial system that was stacked against them. That is a very serious charge from Members of the Dáil, but that is what they said. What happened when the jury of their peers acquitted them of the charges before them? It was all forgotten. That jury was absolutely grand and fine.That was quite an incredible and an incredibly ignorant contribution from the Deputy. Unfortunately, it gets worse, but I will deal, first, with the points raised by him. The most basic initial research would have led him not to say what he said because it was not based on fact. The reality is that, yes, Jobstown Not Guilty campaigned against an attempt originally brought forward in a proposal made by the prosecution to stack the jury against us. It would have included excluding people from the Jobstown-Tallaght area, people who were active in campaigning groups, either for or against water charges, and people who had expressed themselves in public or on social media on issues concerning water charges. That was the proposal-----

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	482	This is extremely relevant because we are talking about the politically appointed nature of the Judiciary and the need to move away from it. The jury system becomes extremely important in that context. Deputy Darragh O'Brien was making the point that we were complaining about the way the jury had been stacked against us and then, when it did not go against us, that we all of a sudden had no problem. The point is that the attempt to stack the jury had failed. There was a public campaign which was necessary. It was in advance of any jury or juror being empanelled in the case. The judge rejected those proposals. Therefore, there was a different jury from that proposed by the prosecution. There was a jury of our peers which, obviously, found us not guilty. It was an utterly ignorant contribution from Deputy Darragh O'Brien. What would happen in the case proved the importance of campaigning on the issue to ensure we would not have a jury that was stacked against us. To quote Deputy Darragh O'Brien in this debate: "They campaigned and many would say intimidated the members of the jury by sending out live tweets during that court case." He then, as the Acting Chairman recognised, withdrew the remark but only as regards intimidation. He went on to say: "...there were questions and campaigns by members of Solidarity-People Before Profit against the jury selection. That happened and you cannot dispute that." It is absolutely incredible. To say explicitly that jurors were intimidated by tweets being sent - it was a robust jury system, a jury that saw the evidence in front of their eyes for ten weeks - the actual trial was nine weeks - that saw the evidence of garda after garda being contradicted by video evidence-----

This is an attempt to re-run the case, to say the jury was somehow intimidated because of tweets being sent. It is absolute nonsense. People need to accept that they did not get the result they perhaps might have liked, that they did not manage to criminalise protest, because a jury saw through what was happening. It is of a piece with what is happening in the attempts to re-run the case to say people were terrorised by what the Taoiseach said.

I have listened carefully, as has my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, to the contributions made in the House in the past week or more. It is fair to say we have had an open and lengthy debate, properly so. It is important to acknowledge that Deputies have expressed differences of opinion about a number of aspects of the Bill and that is how debate should be conducted. Having listened to the contributions, I am open to reflecting on how aspects of the Bill might be improved on Committee Stage and as the Bill progresses through the House. Deputies have generally accepted the need for reform and an update of the current 20 year old system. There is an obligation on us, as legislators, to ensure the reforms we bring forward are not only appropriate but effective. I reject any notion that the preparation of the Bill has been rushed or that it represents a response to A Programme for a Partnership Government 2016 to the exclusion of anything else. Domestically, the Bill is the result of an extensive consultation process commenced by my Department over three years ago. Internationally, the Bill will enable the Government to maintain and enhance Ireland’s reputation for having an independent and professional Judiciary which is ranked among the best and most effective in the world.  Last Thursday we welcomed the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr. Thorbjørn Jagland, to the House. I was pleased to be able to meet him at the start of his official visit to the country in advance of the publication by GRECO, the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption, of its seventh round compliance report on Ireland. I was one of the few Deputies in the House who had the opportunity to be an interviewee in the lead-up to the GRECO report. The report concludes that Ireland has not implemented recommendation No. 7 of the fourth round report on Ireland which called for the current system of selection, recruitment, promotion and transfer of judges to be reviewed, with a view towards targeting the appointments at the most qualified and suitable candidates in a most transparent way. The enactment of the Bill will address GRECO’s concerns about the system for appointing judges. I might remind Deputy Michael McGrath who discussed this issue at some length that the Bill has been the subject of intensive consultations with members of the Judiciary. Much of the Bill reflects reforms they have sought during the years. During the course of the Second Stage debate Deputies raised a number of points. Given the time available, the House will forgive me if I am not in a position to cover all of them. However, I understand and expect we will have an opportunity to revisit all of these aspects in the course of further deliberations in the House on Committee and Report Stages. At the outset of the debate, following my contribution, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan appeared to suggest we were somehow losing the expertise and input of judges in determining who was best suited to become a member of the Judiciary. The Bill provides that the three most senior judicial office holders will be full members of the commission and, contrary to an impression some Deputies, including Deputy Niall Collins, have created, all five court Presidents, including the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court, will be very much involved in the decision-making committees when it comes to deciding who is to be selected and recommended for appointment to their particular courts. Deputy Jim O’Callaghan and other Deputies, including Deputies Bríd Smith, Stephen S. Donnelly and John Lahart, expressed the view that the retention of the Attorney General on the commission was maintaining an interest on the part of the Government in the process and was, therefore, questionable in some way. This could not be further from the truth. The Oireachtas decided in 1995 that the Attorney General should be a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB. The reason for this, which is still applicable, is that the Attorney General is uniquely placed to assist in assessing the suitability of those coming before the JAAB. That will also be the case with the new commission, given the vital role of the Attorney General vis-à-vis the Bar, the interaction of the Office of the Attorney General with members of the legal professions and the experience and expertise of the office in dealing with rulings of the courts. The Deputy further suggested lay people would not have an adequate insight into what was required to do the job. To my mind, the now improved text of section 15 of the Bill which sets out meticulous requirements on the suitability of lay persons as members of the commission, as well as the experience of lay persons in neighbouring jurisdictions, with the criteria for selection procedures to be developed under Part 8, all ensure non-legal or non-judicial persons will be more than capable of performing the functions to be assigned under the Bill. I remind the House that there are three lay members on the existing Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and their input during the years has been particularly positive and welcome. Deputies Niall Collins and Mattie McGrath compared the Private Members' Bill unfavourably in that regard. There will be nothing to prevent representatives of the bodies mentioned in the Bill from coming forward to serve on the new commission, but there is no justification for restricting non-legal people to these bodies only. Deputy Jonathan O’Brien indicated that he would seek amendments on the training requirements of the Judiciary and aspects of the lay qualifications for membership. He also referred to judicial conduct and the matter of ethics. I note the support of the Deputy for many of the measures contained in the Bill and his intention to bring forward amendments in respect of some aspects. Other Deputies also raised issues about ethics and the lack of a complaints mechanism in relation to the Judiciary. The House is aware that the Tánaiste recently published the Judicial Council Bill 2017, another piece of important legislation, which I hope the House will have an opportunity to debate in the coming months with a view to having it enacted by the end of the year. Deputy Brendan Howlin appeared to suggest the Public Appointments Service process was some form of perpetuating mechanism for senior public servants and, presumably, board appointees. I am unsure if this was what he intended to suggest. Certainly if it was, it was an unexpected and inaccurate contribution to the debate. State board appointments are now managed through the Public Appointments Service. Are we to take from the Deputy’s comments that this independent mechanism is a sort of fit-up for appointees? If that is the case, I reject it as inaccurate and misguided. The Deputy appears to suggest that opening up eligibility for appointment to the High Court for District Court judges and, more broadly, the general requirement that serving judges must now go through a commission process risk damaging the independence and subjectivity of judges who may wish to advance. In this case I state categorically I do not agree. We are moving the selection decision process to an independent commission and a key principle of reform, called for by the Judiciary, is that, in the furtherance of independence, serving judges should be required to go through an open and transparent selection process. Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett and other Deputies referred to the experiences of other jurisdictions and the lessons that could be learned, for good and not so good, from them. We have looked at the experience in other common law jurisdictions, which is entirely appropriate and advisable. We are not trying simply to follow that line. However, recent reforms have been instructive, in the United Kingdom particularly, and we can only benefit from taking the opportunity to adapt and develop our own best practice through looking at what can be described as acceptable international best practice. That is what we are doing in the debate. Deputy Mick Wallace suggested the model in England and Wales in which just one recommendation is made, with provision for rejection and-or reconsideration of the recommendation made, might be a preferable approach. This argument was followed by Deputy Thomas Pringle. Because of the constitutional provisions for judicial appointments here, the Government must be the decision-making entity. My advice is that there should be three names and no fewer, where they can be provided, in order to allow the Government to exercise its function under the Constitution. I add, on a point made by a number of Deputies, that my advice is that a strict order of merit would not be fully consistent with the discretion that must be afforded to the Government under the Constitution in dealing with this matter. To respond to a point raised by Deputy Clare Daly, I want to be clear that the Minister is not part of any senior judicial appointments advisory committee as set out in the Bill. Although this had been proposed in the general scheme, it is not included in the Bill, for which I believe there is a broad welcome. Deputy Ryan and others were of the view that the Bill represented something of an attack on the Judiciary. I clearly cannot accept any suggestion of the sort. I set out in my opening remarks the extent to which essential aspects of the reforms from day one were consistent with key aspects of the submissions made by the Judiciary. I also explained how the Bill had been adjusted to take account of further matters raised in close consultation with the Judiciary. Yes, there are different viewpoints, but the Bill can in no sense be interpreted as an attack on the Judiciary, nor could it possibly be intended to be such. Deputies Willie O'Dea, Éamon Ó Cuív, Robert Troy and others made the point that the office of Chief Justice was at the pinnacle of the judicial arm of the State and ought not to be overlooked in determining the position of chairperson of the commission. Under the Bill, a commission function will be to select and recommend persons for appointment. While the Judiciary will be centrally involved in that function, selection and recommendation for appointment to judicial office are not inherently judicial functions. The Chief Justice will have a direct role in the selection of persons for appointment to all courts and it is important this be the case. Deputy Jack Chambers expressed concern about the identity of the lay chairperson. I do not accept the premise that because we simply do not yet know who the lay chairperson will be, it in some way demonstrates a flaw in the thinking behind the provision. How do we ever know who will be the chairperson of a new statutory body for which we provide in new legislation? I do know that the non-legal, non-judicial chairperson will be eminently suitable, fit and proper to be appointed because the requirements of section 15 are exacting and onerous. This is something to which we can return on Committee Stage. I trust the Public Appointments Service to do its job in the appointment of the non-judicial, non-legal chairperson and the other non-legal members of the commission who may from time to time be appointed. No appointments of lay members may be made unless both Houses pass a resolution approving them. In response to points raised by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Marc MacSharry, it is essential that there be a critical mass of non-judicial, non-legal voices on the commission with a range of expertise and experience to complement the indispensable inputs of the senior Judiciary and legal members. In that regard, I echo points made by the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, in the course of the debate and in public utterances on the Bill that one should not conflate the idea of having non-legal or lay members with inexperienced or non-expert members. Listening to the commentary of some Members of the House, one would be forgiven for thinking it would be a random selection of men and women off the street.There will be an element of experience and expertise, although broader than the strict confines of the tradition of legal service, qualifications or judicial qualifications. I agree with the Minister, Deputy Ross, in that regard. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae emphasised his confidence in the Judiciary, as did Deputy Murphy. I share that view. The Bill is simply about modernising and strengthening the system we use to select persons for appointment to judicial office. It is not, as Deputy O’Brien suggested, a reflection of some sense of dissatisfaction with the Judiciary. There is no logic in that interpretation. Deputy Shortall and others made several points about entry to the legal professions from which judges are drawn and related matters. These are interesting points and there is much to them, but they are extraneous to the Bill. Again, the scope of this Bill is focused on the appointments mechanism. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, spoke on issues of diversity. These matters are close to his brief and I thank him for that contribution. We have built in diversity objectives into this Bill. These will be the subject matter of debate on later Stages. Deputies McGuinness and Browne said we are putting an unnecessary quango in place. The new commission will replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which is resourced from within the Courts Service. The replacement of that board with a new commission will represent a modest but much needed investment to bring the system into the 21st century. While there may not be an enormous number of appointments annually, each appointment is vitally important, as there can be, of course, hundreds of applications annually. This is not the only business the commission will undertake. The Bill tasks the commission with a significant research, development and consultative role to ensure the State has in place and maintains a best practice model of judicial selection that is kept up-to-date with and abreast of international best practice. A specialist body of that nature will generate a small staffing requirement. It needs adequate resources to function effectively. The similar Private Members’ Bill, referred to during the course of this debate, also identified a staffing requirement. On the remarks of Deputies Ó Cuív, Kelleher and Donnelly regarding the information that the commission will provide to the Government, the position is that, under section 47, the commission must give to the Minister a statement of recommendation setting out the reasons a person is considered suitable for appointment to the judicial office concerned. Section 45 requires the commission to provide the results of any test and interview. This is in addition to information already required to be provided under the existing arrangements. Several Deputies raised concerns about the involvement of the Public Appointments Service. The important aspect about the selection of lay members is that the independent Public Appointments Service will do it. Accordingly, there can be no charge of political or legal interference or presumption of bias or preferential treatment in who is selected as a lay member. The Public Appointments Service will conduct a selection process and recommend the names to the Minister. The Minister will appoint them but only following resolutions approving the appointments in the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is fair and reasonable and will meet the concerns of the Minister, Deputy Ross, and other Members. Contrary to suggestions, I cannot see how this process could be construed as anything other than independent or how it could be characterised as being some sort of insider preferment nor can I see how it could be predicted that this would be more likely to deliver lay commission members with a so-called agenda than, say, a nominating body would. The Public Appointments Service is the centralised provider of recruitment, assessment and selection services providing recruitment services to many public bodies. It is the recognised leading recruiter for public service jobs in the State. I cannot think of a more appropriate body to be involved in the recommendation process. On matters concerning conduct and ethics, Deputies drew attention to several matters of concern which, while not within the scope of this Bill, fall to be dealt with in the context of the Judicial Council Bill. The Tánaiste published that Bill on 1 June 2017 in tandem with the Bill before us. It is now awaiting Second Stage in the Seanad. Its purpose is to provide for a judicial conduct committee which will investigate complaints about judicial misconduct where the conduct is not sufficiently grave as to warrant recourse to Article 35 of the Constitution. It has taken considerable time to prepare this legislation. I hope Members of the Seanad will not say it was rushed because, like this Bill, it was far from rushed. It was a product of much consultation and long sought after by members of the legal profession and the Judiciary, as well as the general public. Following the progress of this Bill over the next several weeks and its ultimate enactment, I hope similar progress can be made with the sister Bill, the Judicial Council Bill. I look forward to introducing that legislation to this House at the earliest opportunity. Again, I call for a full and frank debate on that legislation and encourage all Members to make a contribution on an important piece of legislative architecture dealing with the Judiciary. I acknowledge the contributions of Members, all of which were important, and thank them. Some of them will confirm progress on the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	504	I welcome the co-operation we have had from all sides of the House on this Bill. I would like to mention in particular Deputy Troy who has already interjected on this Bill and made a contribution, Deputy Munster and others on the joint Oireachtas committee who have shown an interest in it over time. I have been supportive of the principles behind the Bill. That does not mean I expect it to pass without controversy.I appreciate and welcome any scrutiny of it, and I recognise the need for this. As Deputies will know, this is an enabling Bill to allow the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to support the bid and the hosting of the Rugby World Cup in 2023. The Rugby World Cup is one of the largest global sporting events after the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup. It is held every four years, with the next tournament to be played in Japan in 2019. It has grown substantially since its inauguration in 1987, and it is expected to continue to grow in the future. The hosting of a Rugby World Cup by Ireland has the potential to be very beneficial to Ireland in terms of visitor numbers and sporting and international profile, and for communities across the island. A successful bid for the Rugby World Cup would have the dual advantage of promoting sport and tourism. There would be very considerable tourism potential as the tournament would take place during Ireland's shoulder season for overseas tourism, between mid-September and late October. It is estimated that the tournament would draw approximately 450,000 high-spending visitors. There would be many other benefits to the country, not least the profile received through television coverage of the tournament across the world and the exposure that the country would get through the thousands of visiting media. In addition, hosting a Rugby World Cup on the island of Ireland would provide communities all over Ireland with the opportunity to host teams from places as diverse as Tonga, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand and Argentina.  The Governments in the North and South view hosting the Rugby World Cup as a unique opportunity for Ireland and have been supporting this project since 2013, when the initial feasibility study was received. This study was the subject of in-depth examination by the cross-Border Rugby World Cup Working Group during 2014. Its report was agreed by the Government, and in December 2014 it was agreed that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport should support the preparation of an all-island bid by the IRFU, in co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities. The bid also has the full co-operation of the GAA, which has put key stadiums, such as Croke Park, at the disposal of the bid. An oversight board, chaired by former Tánaiste, Dick Spring, and comprising key sporting and business figures and Government representatives, has guided the compilation of the bid. This has been supported by interdepartmental groups in both jurisdictions, chaired respectively by the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach. My Department led the co-ordination of the public sector input and managed relations with the IRFU and the Department of the Economy in Northern Ireland. The Government has regularly reviewed the project at Cabinet and approved the submission of the applicant and candidate phase bids. Ireland has now completed two of the three phases to the bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023. The applicant phase was completed on 25 August 2016, with the submission of a bid questionnaire comprising detailed responses to over 90 questions. Ireland then progressed to the more detailed candidate phase in October 2016. The candidate file posed over 350 questions, and the compilation of the bid required extensive Government involvement and support. As part of this phase, the World Rugby technical review group visited candidate countries to discuss the progress of the compilation of the candidate file. The visit to Ireland took place on 21 and 22 March. It viewed key stadiums and met with the President, Taoiseach and Ministers, the IRFU and the oversight board and received a number of presentations from sectoral experts.  The formal bid to host the Rugby World Cup was submitted on 1 June 2017. The candidate file ran to approximately 1,000 pages, setting out responses on a range of topics, including finance and governance, transport, match venues, security, ticketing strategy, accommodation provision and commercial rights protection. In response to the templates issued by Rugby World Cup Limited on 7 April, the bid also contained draft guarantees and undertakings seeking the support of governments to stage the tournament in 2023 for the payment of the tournament fee, the underwriting of the tournament budget, and the provision of public sector supports for the staging of the tournament. They will be discussed further with Rugby World Cup Limited over July, with final versions to be agreed and signed by 31 July.  At an earlier stage of planning for Rugby World Cup 2023, the preliminary legal advice was that legislation was not likely to be required in respect of the State's contribution to a new company that might be established regarding hosting Rugby World Cup 2023. After further examination, however, the Attorney General's office advised in early May that express statutory authority through the passing of primary legislation is necessary for a Minister to provide capital support to a tournament company and to provide the necessary guarantees and underwrites to Rugby World Cup Limited. This is based on the judgment of the Attorney General that there is no specific statutory power for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to expend money or give guarantees directly on a unique major sporting event such as the Rugby World Cup. Therefore, for the avoidance of doubt, the advice is that express statutory authority is required. This statutory authority must be in place before the Minister signs the guarantees. This means the Bill has to become law before 31 July.  Based on this advice, the Bill before the House has been drafted. The purpose is to enable the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to provide the guarantees and undertakings as part of the bid and, if the bid is successful, enable the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to support the staging of the tournament. I will now outline the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 defines the terms used in the Bill. On section 2, if the bid is successful a tournament company must be formed with the Irish Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the IRFU as shareholders. Section 2 empowers the Minister to play a full part as a shareholder in that company. An agreement on a comprehensive governance structure for the envisaged company that would protect the State's interests is currently being finalised between all three parties.  Regarding sections 3 and 4, as part of the bid the Government is providing an underwrite for the tournament budget and the provision to enable the Minister to give this underwrite is set out in section 3. The underwrite is to give Rugby World Cup Limited the assurance that the tournament would still proceed even if ticket revenues were not sufficient. The underwrite will cover any shortfall in the budget and would come into effect only if the tournament revenues did not cover the tournament costs. Current projections are that the tournament company will make a substantial surplus, which would accrue to the Governments and, in these circumstances, the guarantee would not be called upon. As with all previous Rugby World Cups, the hosting of the tournament will be funded by ticket revenue. Those revenues will begin to be received in 2022 and the company will be in operation for a number of years before those revenues are available. It is planned that the tournament company would source the cashflow requirements in those years from commercial sources prior to the receipt of ticket income. In the event that unexpected cash flow needs arise, section 3 enables the Minister to advance funding, including loans, to a tournament company. A number of rights held by Rugby World Cup Limited, such as those concerning selected sponsorship categories, hospitality and licensing, are on offer for potential hosts to bid. This matter is still under negotiation and Rugby World Cup Limited may decide not to sell any of these rights. The provisions in sections 3 and 4 grant the Minister all potential options to support any purchase of these rights and to structure that purchase in such a way that would be of best advantage to the State and the tournament. Section 5 enables the Minister to pay the tournament fee for the territory of the island of Ireland to be the host territory for Rugby World Cup 2023. The bid proposes that, after receipt of the projected surplus from the operation of the tournament company, the Government will pay the tournament fee directly to Rugby World Cup Limited. As with the tournament underwrite, this support would be shared with Northern Ireland along an agreed ratio. These provisions in sections 2 to 5, inclusive, would be exercised with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance.  On section 6, a number of other assurances are sought from the Government by Rugby World Cup Limited that the broader environment will be suitable to stage the tournament. These include protection for its trademarks and intellectual property and the support of the Garda in the provision of a secure environment to host the tournament. Section 6 empowers the Minister to provide such undertakings on foot of a decision of the Government. Sections 7 and 8 cover expenditure under the Bill and the commencement provisions.  Hosting Rugby World Cup 2023 is a unique opportunity for Ireland. It would be of great benefit to the country from sporting, economic, cultural and profile perspectives, and this Bill enables the Government to fully support it. Working closely with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive, the Government has been examining the case for hosting for over four years now and we are confident of the case for hosting and of the strength of the bid. The support of the House through the passing of this Bill would send a strong signal to World Rugby of Ireland's desire to win the bid and to host the tournament in 2023. I commend the Bill to the House.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	507	He was. He was very excited about it and I am glad to realise it. As I said to the Minister when he contacted me over the past number of days and when he came before the committee, we as a party will support this legislation because we think it is very important and fundamental in underpinning the bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup, which is one of the world's major sporting events, as the Minister said. It is a fantastic opportunity and offers huge potential for the island of Ireland to demonstrate all that we have to offer. I compliment the team headed up by former Tánaiste, Dick Spring, the ambassador, Brian O'Driscoll, Philip Browne of the IRFU and the many others who are involved with this bid. A lot of preparatory work has gone into this bid going back many years. When we look back, the formal bid was launched in December 2014. That is two and a half years ago. It was the fourth quarter of 2015 when public sectors in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland came together to ensure a speedy delivery of the Government's commitment to this bid. That is where the only negative lies, which is somewhat regrettable. That is the fact that this legislation is coming in at the 11th hour. We have to ask the question. Despite the fact that the Minister's officials sought assurances from the Attorney General, why did it take until April of this year for the Attorney General to be confident in her advice to the officials in the Minister's Department? It is not good enough. It looks amateurish. Who is going to be held to account for the misinformation and the delay in time? Even at that late stage, last week, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport chose to prioritise the Judicial Appointments Bill even though this Bill was ready to come before the House. Where was the Minister's excitement for this critical legislation last week? We should have debated Second Stage of this legislation last Tuesday night in the Dáil. It would have enabled a longer period of time for scrutiny. I acknowledge that the Minister's officials came before the Oireachtas committee and facilitated a time that suited me in order to give a briefing on this legislation. However, there are other Members of the Dáil who have an interest in this legislation. There are Members of the Dáil who did not have the opportunity to go to the transport briefing last week. I know from having met with the IRFU how excited, eager and fully prepared it is, and it has been very complimentary of the GAA and the FAI, but more so to the GAA, for making their stadia available. I want to acknowledge that today. However, I do not get that same confidence and excitement from the Minister, despite what he said earlier. This tournament has huge potential. It has potential in the 800 million people that make up its broadcast audience throughout the world. There is phenomenal potential to market the island of Ireland as a whole. We anticipate 445,000 international visitors. Again, that offers huge potential to us as a country. The matches are going to be played in anything between eight and ten venues, ensuring that it will be inclusive and spread throughout north, south, east and west of the country. The 45 team training grounds will ensure that every county in every region stands to benefit from the hosting of the Rugby World Cup. As an island nation, we are lucky that we are so well served from the point of view of 273 direct destinations by air and another 1,200 destinations serviced indirectly. We also have 5.2 million passengers that come directly by ferry. We are ideally placed. As I said, the only difficulty is that we are a little late with this legislation. Turning to the legislation itself, I understand that we have completed two of the three phases, the applicant phase and the candidate phase. This is now part of the evaluation phase. This legislation guarantees payment of the tournament fee of €120 million. It will also underwrite the tournament budget. We have not been made aware of what exactly the tournament budget is, and I understand that is for competitive reasons. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that point. The Bill also gives an undertaking with regard to the support of the public services for the tournament. Perhaps the Minister could indicate what public services are going to be improved. Are we talking about the improvement of public transport to a certain venue? Are we talking about ensuring that wherever the international teams are training, they will have adequate and sufficient broadband to match what they are used to in their country of origin? Are we talking about installing public lighting? Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on what exactly that will be. The Department gave an indication of the sequence and timeline of the advice from the Attorney General. I highlighted that already. It is welcome that the misinformation was identified before it was too late and that the Minister has decided to err on the side of caution and produce this legislation. With regard to the Bill, it is planned that the tournament company will externally source its cash flow requirements prior to the receipt of ticket sales. Where does the Minister plan to source the cash flow requirements prior to ticket sales? My understanding from the briefing, though perhaps I was wrong, was that the main source of funding for us as the host nation will be the ticket sales. I read an article in The Guardian by Robert Kitson, who highly recommends Ireland as head and shoulders above the other two countries in the final stages. He raised an interesting question. As a country with a population of 6.1 million on our island, how can we guarantee that games such as Tonga versus Uruguay will have a sell-out crowd? Let us compare that to a country like Great Britain with a population in excess of 60 million, where there are people who do not have to travel that same distance and would quite easily go to a game such as that. For instance, if Tonga and Uruguay were playing in Derry, how could we guarantee that we would have sufficient numbers going to that match? Is that being taken into account in terms of the estimated figures of attendance and tickets sales of 450,000? The Bill enables the Minister to support the potential purchase of commercial rights held by Rugby World Cup Limited, rights by a tournament company or another entity if it is deemed appropriate to directly purchase commercial rights. What commercial rights are we talking about? It is stated that there are a number of these rights. Perhaps the Minister could clarify exactly what rights they are. The Minister made comparisons to previous world cups. I gave the example of comparing Ireland to Great Britain. We have a population of 6.1 million while Great Britain has a population in excess of 60 million. How can we ensure that we are comparing like with like? With regard to television rights and free-to-air television, I understand the bid for the 2019 Rugby World Cup has been won by Eir Sport. However, 13 out of the 48 games will still be free to air. Will that still be the case for the Irish Rugby World Cup, if we are successful, in 2023? I also wish to ask about our accommodation. We are talking about attracting a huge number of people to our country. Can we be sure that we will have sufficient capacity to cater for them?In the event of an act of terrorism or a natural catastrophe, such as the ash cloud leading to people not being able to come to the tournament, what insurance is in place to ensure that we will not have to call in our guarantee?
#KevinOKeeffe	unknown-#KevinOKeeffe-party	unknown-#KevinOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#KevinOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	508	We must acknowledge and compliment the IRFU on taking it upon itself to bid for this World Cup in 2023. I assure the Minister that Fianna Fáil will be supporting the bid. However, it raises many questions. Like previous tourism initiatives, such as The Gathering, this has the potential to generate enormous income for this economy, income that is still much needed. However, it has become clear over the past number of months that the Department is one of the most disorganised in the history of the State. Chaos has prevailed in every decision that has been made. I refer to the Bus Éireann strike, the fact that we are still awaiting the publication of the Moran inquiry, the fact that, with a stroke of his pen, the Minister jeopardised the operations of many hauliers, and the fact that appointments to State boards under the Minister's remit still have not been made. Like every Minister, the Minister relies on the advice of those in his Department. Was he not advised to move earlier on the pre-legislative requirements? I know he answered this in his speech but I am still not happy. Why did he wait until the end of the candidate phase of the process to seek legal advice from the former Attorney General on Government procedures to properly underwrite the bid? In September 2015, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, as the junior Minister, gave the Government's undertaking to underwrite the bid. In October 2016, during the next phase of the assessment for the bid, the Minister gave a commitment on behalf of the Government to underwrite the bid. He put out a fancy press release on the issue and we moved on to the next stage, which commenced on 1 November 2016. The Minister waited until 7 April 2017 to seek advice from the former Attorney General, or so the Minister tells us in his letters. Was it because the Minister was not talking to the former Attorney General following the disagreements over a previous motion in 2016 regarding the eighth amendment on which the Minister did not agree with the former Attorney General? We now see the Minister taking two opinions from the former Attorney General. The Minister and his Department must get their act together. Clarification needs to be provided on the breakdown of the full costs that the Government is prepared to underwrite for the tournament. The figure is reported to be €380 million, and I remind the Minister about what happened when the 2015 Rugby World Cup was held in England. The Labour Government and the then Minister for Sport, Andy Burnham MP, agreed in 2008 to underwrite a figure of £80 million, which was a host fee for the tournament, and also provided guarantees to cover security costs. This was done in 2008 well in advance of the bid being submitted in 2009. The host fee of €120 million for the 2023 Rugby World Cup is an increase of €40 million from the host fee that was required to host the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The Government has rightly agreed to underwrite this in this Bill but, in the near future, we need clarification on the breakdown of the rest of the costs that the Government is prepared to underwrite for the purposes of transparency.  The Bill contains an undertaking to provide support in respect of public transport services for the tournament. I remind the Minister that it is the duty of his Department to do so anyway and it should not have to be enshrined in legislation for him to do so for the tournament. There is a time and a place for political grandstanding but I agree that it should never come at the cost of positively promoting Ireland. Fianna Fáil will ensure that this legalisation will pass through the House in the required time before the summer recess on 31 July. The Minister needs to accept that rushed legislation is never good practice but everyone in this House needs to accept that lreland's bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup could be over before it begins without this legislation being passed so it important that we get the Bill through. We need to take a bit of short-term pain to reap the long-term gain. On foot of the letter of 30 May 2017, the Minister wrote to the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, of which I am Vice Chairman, and asked us to bypass pre-legislative scrutiny. We agreed to do so but as Deputy Troy said, we did it without giving other Deputies a chance to ask questions. We spent three months on the fixed-charge legislation and when we get a chance to come here, this Bill is rushed through and I must say I am disappointed. I hope the hosting of the 2023 Rugby World Cup is a low-risk and high-return situation.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	509	It is fair to say that all parties are hopeful that Ireland's bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup will be successful. I commend all those working on the bid and wish them every success. This Bill is part of that process. It is unfortunate that the Bill has been so rushed. Our understanding was that legal advice received in February was found to be incorrect and the Department had only been aware of the need for this legislation since early May. We are not sure how or why that happened but this is certainly not the preferred way to legislate. This Bill deals with a hypothetical situation. It is underwriting and providing finance and support in the event that Ireland's bid is successful because we are speculating on a sporting event that may or may not take place in six years time. The Bill is extremely vague and, in some instances, it seems that further detail cannot be provided at this point in time. It is also a worry when Deputies are being asked to agree to the handing over of a very substantial sum of money to a company that has not been established without having concrete details of the sums involved or indeed even the process involved. This Bill allows the Minister to provide financial support and funding for the tournament, including a guarantee of that budget, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance. I understand that a tournament fee of £120 million will be given by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the company and that this money will act as a guarantee should the company encounter financial difficulties or in the event that the company is in arrears after the tournament. Additionally, it is expected that approximately £200 million will be required to host the tournament. I am assuming that this money will be spent on upgrading venues, improving public transport links, policing and other State services. I understand that this money is expected to be recouped through ticket sales. Could the Minister give us a bit more clarity on that? World Rugby will retain the television rights and the majority of the commercial and sponsorship rights other than a very small amount of commercial profit, which may be available to Ireland should World Rugby agree to it. Ticket sales are the only method the State has to recoup its spend. This is apparently how the Rugby World Cup has always operated but it is important to be mindful of that fact. Of course, it is suggested that the State could make a profit on that spend and that the £120 million guarantee will be reduced if the tournament is as successful as previous Rugby World Cups. If this all goes according to plan, that is fine.  However, we need to be mindful of potential problems and pitfalls and we must protect the State's interest in this situation. There are some issues that have not been addressed by the Bill and there are issues on which we require reassurance. We have no figures. I assume that those involved with the bid have an idea of figures. However, there are no figures in this legislation which could prove problematic down the road should the figures escalate.Section 3(a) states that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will "provide financial support in respect of the tournament budget (including any guarantee of that budget)". This could be interpreted as providing a blank cheque. What are the checks and balances to manage the budget and to protect the State's interests? I would like some clarity from the Minister on that aspect. This should be amended to ensure that the handing over of these sums of money involves Oireachtas support rather than merely the consent of the Minister for Finance. These costs could spiral, and it is also important that there is accountability. While I understand that the criteria for the bid are broad, some of the guarantees sought by World Rugby and which are provided for in this Bill are vast and vague, to put it mildly. While there may be no malice intended, the lack of detail could have unintended consequences. For example, section 6 of the Bill requires that the Minister provide undertakings to the provisions of security, public infrastructure and other such public services. This part of the Bill is also open-ended and I assume that more services could be added. Does this mean that An Garda Síochána will be at the full disposal of the company and the tournament for its duration? If there was a failure in one of these services, would the State then somehow be liable? There is much detail missing here and we seek clarity on all the issues I have raised. In this Bill, we commit to providing adequate infrastructure and accommodation. It could be argued that, to date, we have failed to provide adequate infrastructure and accommodation for our own citizens, never mind hundreds of thousands of additional visitors. I ask the Minister to elaborate and give clarity on what is specifically envisaged by this, whether it is stadium access or broadband. We also currently have the scandal of families living in hotel accommodation. The previous Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government promised to have all families out of this type of accommodation by last week. This obviously has not happened. The remedies are also totally unacceptable. Hubs are not appropriate homes for families. We also have a shortage of hotel rooms in Dublin. Anyone who has tried to look for a room in the capital city knows that rooms are scarce, and would also know that the prices of rooms are scandalous. How would we accommodate all of our visitors? If we host the tournament without sufficient beds and accommodation, it would be disastrous for the State, but also for our reputation. Another issue that needs to be tidied up is the arrangement between the shareholders of the company. The shareholders will be the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, a Minister from the Executive in the North and the IRFU. The Minister is the only one who is providing this guarantee to the best of my understanding, and we need clarity on the position of each of the shareholders as well. I know the Minister said there was a ratio breakdown. I ask him to be a little more definitive on what exactly that is, and we also need clarity on commercial rights and sponsorships. It is important that we have a mechanism to ensure that there is a transparent and open process for the allocation of commercial rights and sponsorships. This system should be fair and open to all relevant, interested parties. Despite all the issues and the clarity I have sought, and the fact that I have said the legislation is rushed, vague and vast - which is an understatement - Sinn Féin will be supporting the Bill. We recognise that, if this bid is successful, it has major potential to showcase Ireland and for tourism and sport in general. Having said that, we still have concerns regarding the lack of detail, the potential for difficulties down the road, the blank cheque, the overrun, the oversight, the costings and all of that sort of thing. As I said at the start, it is not a very acceptable way to expect to have this Bill hammered through in one day.

The challenge would start from that day. The easy part is us passing legislation underwriting the company that would be formed. The challenge is how to undertake the biggest sporting tournament this country has hosted thus far. I know there are people who are sceptical and who are naysayers about the bid, but they are the very same people who are supporting or looking for Ireland to make a bid for the European soccer championship. It would be a much bigger job, and if we undertake the Rugby World Cup, we would be sending out a message that Ireland would be capable of taking on any of these major sporting events. Given that we are a small nation, it would be a very good day for Ireland not only to host it, but to be successful in hosting it. Having said all of that, there are major problems and issues with our approach. I do not want to be negative, so I will try to be as positive as possible and offer any solutions that I or anybody else can come up with. Once we go down this road, it has to be successful. It cannot fail in any shape or form but it is, as I said, a major undertaking, especially given where we are starting from. We cannot host any tournament at the moment because in this city, where we have two of the stadia associated with this bid, one cannot get a bed in a hotel, hostel or bed and breakfast. We are starting from a bad position. We have to address our housing and homelessness crisis in the first instance. Thankfully, the Luas works in the city are near an end, but again, we have a transport problem in Dublin because we cannot move around the city with ease. They are major problems that need to be addressed and six years is a very short time for infrastructural work. While we might have the stadia, we do not have the facilities at the world class level that I think is required. Hopefully, moneys will be spent on upgrading the training facilities that will be required for all of these international teams when they come. I hope that, when the bid is successful, we start very quickly on it, similar to when we had the Special Olympics in Croke Park, and especially that we start to develop the host towns, because that went very well when we had the Special Olympics here in the city. Certain key towns or villages, or in this case, probably rugby clubs, become the host for not the teams, but the supporters. As we saw in the European championships recently, Irish fans were located in two parts of France, which was slightly bizarre, with one group at one end of France, where two matches were held, and the other group at the far end. If we are planning, we should locate teams and supporters in one area for that portion of the tournament so that they can enjoy Ireland. We are a small country and obviously it is not that difficult to move around, but in parts of the country, we still do not have the links that are required, for example, the major motorway between Cork and Limerick, or between Limerick and Galway. The gaps in our public and private transport infrastructure have to be addressed. It even applies to such routes as from Dublin to Derry, and this is obviously connected with the Executive in the North, and to both the Minister's hats of sport and transport.The Minister needs to appeal to the new Northern Executive, when it is formed in September, to get on with the work of building the motorway network or at least the dual-carriageway network between Dublin and Derry and between Derry and the rest of the country as such issues will hamper some of the planning. I believe that will cause problems for the company that is hosting this. I will deal with some of the other issues as we go through the amendments. The amendments that I have seen tabled thus far are practical amendments to allow the Minister to appear before a committee to inform us of the progress as we are going along. Six years will pass quickly and as a Parliament, we need to be able not to hold the Minister to account, but to give him both the encouragement required and the support if practical problems emerge.

#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	512	I will be sharing my time with Deputy Boyd Barrett. We would be delighted to see the Rugby World Cup come to Ireland in 2023 and are inclined to be supportive of the proposals. However, we have some issues and concerns that we will now raise. First, we are not pleased that this Bill is being taken virtually in its entirety on one night. That is not the way business should be done. Rushed legislation does not generally make for good legislation. I understand the position outlined by the Minister that it only became apparent in April or May that this legislation would be necessary for the avoidance of doubt. Had a strong position been taken late last year, however, that we needed a definitive position by a certain cut-off point - perhaps the start of February or the beginning of March - and had the Attorney General come forward with a definitive position by then, we would not be having this rushed debate tonight which we consider has been unnecessary and about which we are dissatisfied. I am registering our opinion in this regard. As for the essence of the issues, I will raise three issues in my contribution, the first of which is the issue of ticket prices. This is a really important issue for an event like this. This event must not be one where the ticket prices can only be afforded if one is wealthy or very comfortable or if one is prepared to go into hock for a long time to come. This should be an event for the people of Ireland and for that to be so, a key issue is that ticket prices should be affordable. Major sporting events in other countries have been tainted and tarnished by high ticket prices that put the pleasure of sitting in the stadium beyond the reach of ordinary people and their families. I need only give the example of the Olympic Games in Brazil last year where we saw the spectre on our television screens of vast areas of empty seating because those on the other side of the stadium walls could not afford to get in and a high percentage of those in the stadia were filling the corporate boxes. That must not happen here. I want to make that point strongly. Second, if we hold the Rugby World Cup in 2023, it cannot be like the tide coming in and then going out with nothing left behind as a legacy for the people and sports community of Ireland. There must be a legacy in terms of better public transport, better broadband facilities and, crucially, better facilities for sporting organisations, in particular, the ordinary rugby clubs the length and breadth of the country, which nourish and develop the game at the grassroots level and without which rugby in this country would not be anywhere near the force that it is today. I seek feedback from the Minister in his reply as to his vision of how that could be a legacy and benefit for the ordinary clubs. The other issue I will make reference to, but not in great detail because it will be debated later on when we are discussing amendments, is Deputy Eamon Ryan's important amendment about television rights. This should not be a pay-per-view operation. It should not be the case that someone who wants to watch the games will have to fork out cash for the profit of large corporations. Television rights should be provided on a free-to-air basis. I ask the Minister to comment on that. What is the Minister's view? What is his opinion on how this issue might pan out? There are other issues regarding the scale of the underwriting that is being spoken of but these will be looked at later on when we are discussing the amendments. I will park my comments there and make way for Deputy Boyd Barrett.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	513	Like Deputy Barry and many others who have spoken or commented on this Bill, I believe we would all welcome a globally important sporting event such as the Rugby World Cup to the country for a range of reasons. Obviously, significant numbers of people in this country appreciate the sport and many people play and love the sport. There also will be potentially a significant economic benefit to the State in terms of the event being hosted here. Arguably, the international attention the country would receive as a result of hosting an event like this would be beneficial. All of those are reasons to be supportive of the bid and of the Government supporting the bid. However, I also have concerns about this issue. Given the speed with which this has been pushed through, I have not had enough time to even fully go through in my mind what are all the potential downsides, dangers and problems we need to look out for. It is important to flag some of them and as has already been noted, to push all this through in one night, as it looks as though will happen, is problematic in that regard. Crucially, we need to be sure that with State funding going into this, we come out on the plus side. That means having financial projections, budgets, costings, etc., in order that we can look at the financial arithmetic of it all if it comes to pass and be fairly confident that there will be a net benefit. Unfortunately, I did not hear the Minister's speech. I am scanning through it. No doubt he alluded to the potential benefits. In particular, he refers to the 450,000 high-spending visitors. I have heard figures, such as €1.2 billion, floating around. The Minister, Deputy Ross, might indicate whether that is the figure that is floating around.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	514	I understand the spend would be approximately €760 million.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	515	That is the estimate referring to expenditure by people who would come to visit. That is obviously significant and would generate employment, spin-off activity and tax revenue. I note in passing, because it is relevant, that we need to look again at the 9% VAT rate. The rate was brought in because the economy was on its knees. There was an argument about the need to resuscitate tourism, retail and so on when those sectors were on their knees. Those sectors have picked up significantly. I believe they have gained significantly from an economic recovery that, to say the least of it, is uneven in terms of who has benefited. In fact, many people are not benefiting. One group that is not benefiting is made up of low-paid, precarious, zero-hour or banded-hour contract workers. Many of these work in the hospitality, hotel, retail and bar sectors. Yet those sectors have benefited and gained a significant boon from the 9% VAT rate. I believe the case for that VAT rate has expired. I do not believe they need that boon anymore. At the least, it needs to be examined. I am keen to see that considered when we are thinking about who would benefit from the additional expenditure in the context of the Rugby World Cup taking place. It is one thing to say that the State may get back revenue. However, I believe we must be absolutely certain that the State covers its investment from various sources - primarily, I would have thought this will come from areas like VAT – and that we would expect to cover any investment we put in or perhaps make a profit for the State out of it. I believe we should look at the issue of VAT. More generally, we need to be confident that we have a plan to recover any public moneys invested in this event. I do not believe it would be acceptable, although I do not believe we are in danger of it, to repeat some of the scandals we have seen in big sporting bids in some countries, whereby billions were put into projects that, after the events were concluded, were effectively massive white elephants. Such projects included stadia and infrastructure built but never to be used again by anyone. When I was first asked about this six or eight months ago, the first thing I said was that if we are talking about building stadia then I would be against it, as much as I would like to see a sporting event. We are not talking about that, which I welcome. Therefore, we can be more confident that this event can work and not cost us. However, I would like to see and hear as much detail as possible about how the public interest and public moneys and so on are going to be managed and secured such that we do not lose out as a result. I wish to echo the points made about free-to-air television viewing. That is critical. There would be rage, frankly, if public money was spent underwriting and supporting this bid only for a position to come about whereby not everyone was able to watch the tournament on television. There would be absolute anger. I warn the Government not to cause a problem for itself and everyone else and to ensure that does not happen. Otherwise, the Government will endure a backlash. The point about ticket prices is critical. We need to ensure this is an event for everyone and not simply for an elite few. Rugby is not as it is sometimes presented, that is, purely an elitist sport. People from a vast cross-section of Irish society play rugby and they come from all different social backgrounds. However, let us be quite honest. Historically, there has also been in the Dublin and Leinster regions in particular an association with the more privileged sections of society. To some extent that has reflected the reality of the game in certain parts of the country. It is different in other parts of the country but we need to acknowledge this is a fact. Consequently, it will grate badly with people if we do not ensure that this event benefits everyone, that everyone is included, that everyone has an opportunity to go and that no one is prohibited because of the cost of so doing. We need to ensure that the benefits accruing to rugby and the rugby bodies and any benefits that accrue to the State go back into disadvantaged areas to enhance access to sport, rugby and so on. The benefits should go to clubs that perhaps are not part of the elite of the rugby world. They should go to the grassroots game and not only to what might be perceived as the more elite elements of the game. These are critical matters and we need more detail from the Government about how all of this will be managed. We need to be sure that some of the more concerning outcomes – I am not saying they will transpire but they could and have done in other countries – do not transpire in the context of this bid. I am broadly supportive and will not oppose the Bill. I support some of the amendments put forward by Deputy Eamon Ryan. I am keen to hear the Minister's response to those issues and the other issues of concern that have been raised.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	516	The Minister might remember that it was almost 25 years ago when Gay Mitchell, the former Deputy and Minister, was Lord Mayor of Dublin and put forward the idea that Dublin and Ireland should consider bidding for the Olympic Games. The proposal was controversial given the history of grossly inflated and costly FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games. Some of these events have expanded even further and have cost host countries vast sums since the early 1990s. The recent FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro seem to symbolise the exploitation of host countries by the wealthy elites running world football and Olympic sports. No one can doubt that much of the expenditure that did not go on lasting infrastructure in Brazil for the 2014 and 2016 events would have been far better spent on essential health and education services for the people of Rio, Recife, São Paulo and the other great Brazilian cities. While the Athens Olympiad in 2004 did enable Greece to greatly upgrade its transport and other infrastructure, the massive costs were a major factor in the growth of Greece's vast national debt, which was greatly magnified by the subsequent EU-imposed austerity and debt repayment programmes. Consequently, the Government and Oireachtas need to carefully evaluate the likely costs and benefits to Ireland from the proposed hosting of the 2023 Rugby World Cup. I am sympathetic to the general thrust of the amendments before us. The Rugby World Cup needs to be sustainable and singularly well run with tight financial controls. From what I have read and heard of the proposal from my former colleague, Dick Spring, and the Ireland 2023 bid oversight board, those involved seem to have tried hard to meet the necessary strict requirements. Through major funding of the GAA, the FAI and the Irish Rugby Football Union, the people already have contributed to a network of stadiums throughout the island that are of high quality and easily fulfil the criteria necessary to host the tournament. The GAA, whose director general is a member of the 2023 bid oversight board, must be greatly commended on working closely with the IRFU and providing its iconic stadiums, including Croke Park, Páirc Uí Chaoimh, Casement Park and Fitzgerald Stadium, to support the leading rugby grounds such as the Aviva, Thomond Park and Ravenhill Kingspan. The key sporting infrastructure is already in place and is easily the equal of the infrastructure in New Zealand or Wales, which have hosted previous tournaments. Moreover, mention of Wales reminds me that Ireland has been a co-host of this tournament twice already. It is striking that the cost of the bid fee for the Rugby World Cup has escalated over the years from £66 million for New Zealand in 2011 to £80 million for England in 2015. The cost will be £96 million for Japan in 2019. This is expected to rise to £120 million in 2023, which could be the year it is held here.Rugby World Cup Limited is registered in the Isle of Man. I am not sure of the significance of that, but it is an interesting fact. The tournament company mentioned in section 2, of which the Irish Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Rugby Football Union, will be shareholders, as well as running the tournament, is underpinned in sections 3 to 7, inclusive, by a series of onerous financial support guarantees to the tournament owner, Rugby World Cup Limited. These include, in section 3, underwriting the Rugby World Cup operating budget of up to £120 million and providing for the advance of loans, if necessary, to the tournament company. Section 4 provides for the purchase and disposal of commercial rights, although we have no estimate of the likely cost-benefit of such rights. Section 6 commits the State to the provision of security, facilitation of participants, public infrastructure and all the other requirements to stage the tournament. The deadline by which the Minister must sign these guarantees has been set at 31 July 2017. This Bill, in terms of its key provisions, commits the State to considerable potential spending. Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister will inform the Dáil of the likely costs and benefits under section 4, which deals with the commercial rights relating to the tournament. He might also enlighten us as to the input, if any, of the Government into the feasibility studies, how the Government was consulted in the context of the original feasibility study and about the follow-ups that have been undertaken by the committee. I understand that Ireland’s bid is targeting ticket sales of 2 million and that the receipts relating to these sales will be retained by the tournament company. I echo the comments made by my colleagues, Deputy Boyd Barrett and Barry, to the effect that ordinary supporters of clubs such as Clontarf or Suttonians, both of which are located in my constituency, must be able to attend the great games. Can the Minister give us an estimate of what benefits will accrue to the State from ticket sales and the much more lucrative media rights and sponsorship? The issue of free-to-air has, quite rightly, been raised by Deputy Eamon Ryan. The involvement of the Northern Executive in this project is important and noteworthy. It highlights the fact that the IRFU was able to maintain an all-Ireland identity after 1922 while the much more popular game of association football was sadly divided when southern soccer clubs formed their own football association. The all-Ireland quality of rugby football is now one of the game’s most attractive qualities. In addition, rugby has evolved in recent decades to become more than a game of the elite and upper middle class. Since the professional era began in the 1990s, rugby has generally flourished and most regions of the State now have rugby football clubs. The exploits of the national team in recent decades and the performance internationally of the four provincial professional clubs has greatly enhanced our national life. The achievements of Leinster, Munster, Ulster and Connacht and the Ireland team often lifted national spirits in the austerity years since 2008. This is a major reason why, in principle, I am supportive of this Bill. I wish the former Tánaiste, Dick Spring, and the bid oversight committee success on 15 November next. I understand that the World Rugby technical review group has already carried out a two-day fact-finding mission to Ireland and that this group will make a recommendation to World Rugby in October. I presume it will be its decision as to whether we are successful. It is claimed by Ernst & Young that the England-Wales World Cup in 2015 was worth at least £900 million to the UK, with a multiplier effect of up to £2 billion. The 2011 World Cup in New Zealand is said to have generated net profits of £120 million, with a net profit for England-Wales 2015 of approximately £200 million. The proposers also rightly stress the role of the Irish diaspora in supporting the Ireland football and rugby international teams and the closeness of the Irish venues to the three British nations across the Irish Sea and to rugby supporters in our competitor nation, France. It is critical that the Irish World Cup Committee also proposes and delivers financial support for the further development of sport in the more deprived areas of our country. I echo the statements of previous Deputies in this regard. For example, efforts are being made by Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and the other Dublin local authorities to develop the game of rugby in lower income areas where it is traditionally unknown but these efforts need significant support. Financial benefits from the event should be earmarked for the many soccer, Gaelic, boxing, athletics and other sports clubs in areas where facilities are minimal or non-existent. I acknowledge that the Minister has been open to receiving delegations from sports clubs from some of the lower income areas where there are no facilities and where, for example, in terms of boxing, valiant groups of coaches are supporting 50 or 60 children and youths and giving them an outlet on a shoestring budget and without a proper headquarters. Some of the profits from this event must be invested in our communities, particularly those that are most deprived, and across the island from west Belfast to north and west Dublin. Ireland has had a shockingly poor record since 2008 in the provision of essential infrastructure, a point made a few minutes ago by Deputy Ó Snodaigh. Most years since the crash, the Government has barely reached depreciation and essential replacement levels of investment in health, education and transport facilities. Owing to a continuous lack of investment, much of our roads and other infrastructure is crumbling. The virtual cessation of housing supply has crippled our society and left thousands of families and individuals homeless. Ireland needs targets to reach for and attain to encourage badly needed investment. Regardless of whether the rugby World Cup bid is successful - I hope it is - we must greatly expand a national investment programme. The summer of 2023 is a reasonable target date for a first phase of national regeneration in respect, for example, of the metro north line from Swords and Dublin Airport, the cross-city Luas in Cork and Galway, which we have discussed many times in this House over the past two decades, the building of the north-west motorway and the massive upgrade of roads such as the N71 and N72, which, in my view, are currently unsafe. These should be priorities in the transport infrastructure brief. These projects will enhance Ireland’s attraction for visitors of all kinds, including rugby followers, and they will remain valuable to our people long after 2023. This, too, is a target to attain. Our constituents will question the necessity of the Government underwriting a major event or festival and ask whether event organisers should not take all the risks involved. In terms of the organisation that is World Rugby, there are ten or 12 major countries, significant organisations and many other countries where the game is played and people are of the view that should be the case for this event and all events. Perhaps, internationally, institutions such as the EU and United Nations need to examine the structure of the organisation of major sporting events like the Olympics, the Football World Cup, the Rugby World Cup and all the other major continental competitions. The bid oversight committee and Dick Spring had to operate under the current ground rules relating to these events. They have made a huge effort to get this competition for Ireland and I wish them every success. I will be supporting the Bill.

For Ireland to be successful in its bid for the 2023 World Cup, this Bill is of extreme importance. Ireland can only benefit in every aspect if the bid is successful. The man or woman selling hats, scarfs or head bands, the chip vans operating on the day of a game, the hotels, the bed and breakfasts, the bars, the shops and our tourist attractions will benefit if our bid is successful. The estimated revenue that this tournament could generate for Ireland is €800 million, possibly rising as high as €2 billion over the four weeks. At the very least, this would pay for a lot of cataract operations. I was disappointed to hear my colleague Deputy Eamon Ryan, who I like, and others, criticising the Bill yesterday. Does the Deputy not want the Rugby World Cup to come to Ireland?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	518	I do.

The €120 million to be paid to World Rugby if the bid is successful will ensure that taxpayers will not be left paying for this event. Does Deputy Eamon Ryan think that if the Rugby World Cup comes to Ireland, nobody will attend the games and taxpayers will be left paying the bill? That is highly unlikely. That said, there is merit in some of the amendments put forward by the Deputy, including the one to the effect that television rights should be provided on a free-to-air basis.Everyone should be able to watch these games and not have to be on a subscribed service. In addition, the ticket prices should be kept at reasonable cost to ensure that it is affordable to attend these games for both people in Ireland and for the expected visitors. Tickets for games, concerts and other events are being used by touts to get crazy sums of money from our citizens. I hope that will be rectified before any such tournament would come here. I was very glad to hear that Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney was announced as one of the proposed stadia. I again thank the Minister, Deputy Ross, for coming to Fitzgerald Stadium in recent months, meeting the steering committee and discussing plans if such a bid is to be successful. That was an important meeting to have at that time. Outside of Dublin, Killarney has the biggest bed capacity in Ireland and I could not think of a better town to play host to a match. We must remember that Killarney is not the tourism capital of Kerry or of Ireland or Europe, it is the tourism capital of the world. We are just off the back of a massive weekend in Killarney which hosted the Ring of Kerry cycle, the Munster Football Final and the 4 July celebrations only last night, demonstrating the ability of the town to deal with such large crowds and events. This tournament would present the ultimate opportunity to showcase Ireland to the world and to show what we have to offer. When people can see a place like Fitzgerald Stadium with the surrounding backdrop of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks, they will want to come and stay here and not want to return home. That is the legacy that this tournament would leave that is really important for this country. I would very much second what Deputy Mick Barry said, namely, that the real legacy should be better public transport, better infrastructure, better broadband and better facilities for rugby clubs the length and breadth of the country which nourish their sport. I thank the Minister, Deputy Ross, for all his hard work on both backing this bid and in promoting Ireland as the most suitable location.  Even though this Bill has been left to the 11th hour, I am sure everything will be in order by the end of the month. I support this Bill. I support the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Government in every aspect of this bid and the committee, which is being led by the capable hands of the former Tánaiste and fellow Kerryman, Dick Spring. I hope that come November, Ireland will be announced as the official host of the 2023 Rugby World Cup and that the Minister will be there to thank at that time for being the man who steered us in the right direction. I thank him in advance for his efforts on this most important venture.

I wish the Minister and the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, the very best in their bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023. This is a wonderful opportunity to showcase the venues and the country all around the world, and the advertising of Ireland in this way will pay for the costs incurred and the staging of the event. It has been indicated that Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney is to be one of the venues. I am confident that Killarney, Kenmare, Castleisland, Killorglin and Tralee and many other hostelries around the Ring of Kerry will cater and provide accommodation second to none to the teams, visitors and followers. I have every confidence in the Fitzgerald Stadium committee. Tim Murphy, our new and very able chairman, and members of the county board will have the stadium gleaming and ready for whatever bustle and pressure comes with staging the games. Where else in the world is their a venue situated in such a beautiful setting surrounded by the three beautiful lakes and under the shadow of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks? However, work has to be done in the meantime and whatever about the snails and the begrudgers, the Macroom-Ballyvourney bypass will have to be completed in time to ensure that these big sportsmen will not be parked in their cars and buses in Macroom when they should be togged out in Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney. It is up to this Government to provide the funding for this project immediately and to ensure that after all the waiting, the infrastructure - by that I mean a proper road from Cork to Killarney - will be place for 2023. I wish the IRFU and the Minister all the very best. We hope that we will be successful in November in ensuring that this massive opportunity comes to Ireland. We have followers of rugby around Castleisland and Currow. We had great men there who represented Munster and Ireland down the years and they had supporters and followers. They deserve that the Rugby World Cup comes to this country. I wish to raise another matter that is not related to rugby. A group of farmers are waiting in Agriculture House to be met by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed. They are seeking compensation for the loss of their crops last year. I call on the Minister to meet them. The Minister, Deputy Ross, is also a member of the Government. Those men will stay there until the Minister, Deputy Creed, meets them. This is going on for too long. I am sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but those men should be at home doing their work this evening, but they are up in Agriculture House waiting to get what is rightfully due to them.

I also am delighted to speak on this issue. I am delighted to see the Minister sitting back so relaxed, to have all the House ar gach taobh, all sides, supporting him - not like the pillorying he is getting from my colleague beside me and others regarding the Judiciary - including myself regarding his efforts that we would have a small bit of pleasure in the country. I am 100% with him on the Judiciary. It is nice to see the Minister is relaxed and that he is getting plaudits. I agree with what Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said. I will not stray into that matter but those farmers should be at home tonight watching their children playing matches, not up here in Agriculture House. The Minister, Deputy Creed, has to go down to meet them. I will be up to his office in a minute to hunt him down. A successful bid for the Rugby World Cup would be enormously beneficial for rugby clubs all over the State, including our own Clonmel Rugby Football Club that was founded in 1892 and plays its senior rugby in the Munster junior league division. We have many clubs in Tipperary, including the Kilfeacle and Clanwilliam clubs and the famed Rockwell club, to name but a few. Clonmel RFC is a club consisting of hundreds of members ranging from life members to under-8 members. My son played there for a period.  The Ruby World Cup 2023 Bill 2017 will enable the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to support the bid to host the tenth quadrennial Rugby World Cup in 2023 on the territory of this island. I know that Deputy Eamon Ryan has amendments tabled to the Bill but I hope he will not be a killjoy. I do not think he will be. When his colleague was here, a measure was introduced to ensure that we cannot park outside this House. We could play rugby out the back now or graze a few sheep there, and there is also the park across the road. He had a brainwave of putting down grass where we had car parking spaces that we badly needed. Deputy Ryan might give us a hand picking up the rubbish when the games are going on. I am not demeaning him but he made a point today in that respect. If the bid is successful, we will get to stage the tournament.  As Deputy Healy-Rae and many others have said, it is worth the gamble. Why would we not host it? We are a proud sporting people. Why should we not have it in Ireland? The world is our oyster. The Minister should go for it. In terms of the money the Minister has provided for in this Bill, I know people would give out and say there are cancer treatment needs and other issues and we have those issues to deal with but we will have a spin off and a benefit from this Rugby World Cup, not only financially and but also psychologically. It will create a feeling of goodwill and a feel-good factor that only the Irish can put on, whether it is on the field of play, on the streets with the buskers or in the bars or the restaurants. We can do it anywhere whether it is in Galway or Kerry, where the headquarters of Tourism Ireland should be based, according to my two colleagues, and I do not begrudge them. Fair dues to them. They are good at it in Killarney and Kerry and in Kilgarven as well. Any time I have been there, I have been well looked after and I am sure that the Minister would have been looked after well any time he was there himself. In particular, the Bill will grant the Minister the statutory authority to acquire shares in and to support financially an established tournament company by guaranteeing payment of the tournament fee, guaranteeing the tournament’s operating budget, advancing funds to the company, if necessary, and supporting the acquisition of commercial rights for the tournament, including hospitality, licensing and sponsorship. Like others, I emphasise that the television rights must be for all and cannot be grabbed by some greedy broadcaster. Everyone must be able to access this and if they are not able to get tickets, they should be able to watch it. Lastly, it will provide undertakings for the support of public services. In all, the nominal amount of the guarantees or underwritings is likely to be between an estimated €320 million and €340 million. Commitments and surpluses will be split between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, if it is still there, using an agreed ratio. However, the historical profitability of the tournament suggests it is highly unlikely the tournament would translate into a net loss to either Government or anyone else. I am adamant about the television rights. They must be kept for the ordinary people. It is too often the case that sporting events are bought by different television companies. It costs a fortune for people to watch them. It is also very onerous on publicans and hostelries which want to show Sky. We must also have fairly reasonable ticket prices. I am assuming we will get it. I am a positive person and an optimist. Deputy Troy said earlier that he hopes the Minister will still be in the transport portfolio in 2023. I certainly hope that as well. I do not know if Deputy Troy will be here or not but the Minister will be here if he makes these landmark decisions and he gets his judicial commission Bill through before summer. We will know in November. It would give us a lift going into the winter, especially among all the clubs. The Irish Gaels will be able to put their shoulders to the wheel and do what they do best - put on a sporting event and put their best foot forward to attract people to this country. It will be great advertising. We will showcase ourselves to the world with the World Cup which will be watched all over the world. We will get repeat visits and tourism. Afterwards, people will say that we were wise and brave to take the gamble. The man who never made a mistake never made anything. We are taking the chance. We are looking forward to hosting this event. We want it. The public will row in behind it. I know I speak for the people of Tipperary and elsewhere in that. As Deputy Healy-Rae said, let the killjoys go to hell. They can worry about the snails and all those things. We will deal with all those things afterwards. Beidh an spóirt againn agus beidh an craic againn. Beidh a lán daoine an sásta ar fad freisin. I know the Minister is not great with Gaeilge, especially at the rate I say it, but I support him in this and wish him well. It is one project where no one is giving out to him, unlike how they are trying to torture him on other issues such as judicial appointments and how myself and the lads here are fighting with him over the road traffic Bill. We will keep fighting on those issues but we will support him on this one. We want him to get it right. Along with his officials, the Minister and his colleagues can put their best foot forward. He might make a phone call to the Minister, Deputy Creed, to go down and meet those lads at the bottom of the building in Agriculture House and say hello to them and not hide in his ivory tower.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	523	I grew up playing rugby. I have three boys who play rugby, one of whom plays with the famous Terenure Tigers. More than anyone, I want to see us get this World Cup competition to our country. I think we have a chance of winning, such has been the success of Irish rugby in recent years. Growing up, we never thought we would see the quality, skill and the brilliance of Irish rugby that we have seen over the past ten or 15 years in the professional era. Today, I read a comment from the Rugby World Cup Limited regarding a technical issue on the bid. It said its responsibility was to ensure and protect the integrity of the host selection process which continues to be conducted in line with the highest standards of transparency, fairness and professionalism. It might be doing its bit in running a professional game but I do not think the process we have taken has been transparent or professional. I fear how we have gone about it may not be particularly fair to the Irish people. I appreciate comments by Deputies Troy and O’Keeffe that members of the committee had a briefing last week. Other Members of this House knew nothing in terms of the details. I tried. I looked back. The IRFU came in with other sporting bodies in early January this year. It did not say anything about the World Cup. As I understand, it was due to return to the committee in March, I presume in conjunction with the visit that the Minister mentioned in his own article of the technical support team for the World Cup hosting process. The Minister said in his speech that this hosting team met everyone. They did not come into the Houses of the Oireachtas, which they could have done. It would have been the easiest thing in the world for us to host a committee and allow the members to ask questions and for us to live up to those standards of transparency, fairness and professionalism. Deputy Troy is correct. Why was this Bill not dealt with prior to the judicial appointments Bill? Then we would not have been rushed and effectively guillotining it here tonight, something I thought we were agreed that we did not want to do this anymore. Why are we rushing it? Why have we ended up here in this quiet time in the Dáil having to rush it through before 10 p.m.? It is not right, fair, transparent or professional. I am raising my concerns. I have some simple questions. I am not questioning the merits of getting the tournament here. We have heard nothing but the assertion that there will be €800 million spent. That is all we hear. That is the only detail we get. I have some other questions and I do not know if the Minister can answer them in the time available. The problem is that we do not have the time. Whatever we do tonight, the members of the board who are behind this bid, not merely the departmental officials, but the members of the team which is presenting it and connected to Rugby World Cup Limited, should come before the Oireachtas committee early next week, at a day and time of its choosing, and provide an opportunity for all Members to ask any questions they have in a full and frank discussion. I can see no reason they would not concede that. Have they something to hide? The questions I would ask are quite simple. All we have is the note from the Oireachtas research office and the Minister’s speech. From what I read, we are taking all the risk. We provide this upfront fee of €138 million and we are also saying we will provide indemnity and insurance against any costs up to a potential cost that the Oireachtas research service tells us is €200 million. We might also provide loan facilities. We may also go into commercial arrangements in terms of licensing. If we are paying €138 million and are guaranteeing up to €200 million, how much is this event likely to cost? Is it likely to cost more than €338 million to run? I do not think so, or at least not significantly more, but it seems to me that we are taking all the risk. If that is what people think is the right decision, I do not mind, but let us be frank and honest about what risk Rugby World Cup Limited or the international rugby authorities are taking. I want to know the likely costs and revenues. Did I hear earlier that it was not possible to say that because of confidentiality? I do not accept that. I do not accept that it should not be possible to say, for instance, that they estimate that it will cost €350 million, and then give us a rough breakdown, or give us an estimate of the revenues. That is not impossible and it is not an unfair question to ask. Whether it is in France, South Africa or Ireland, I do not see it giving huge advantage to any country, one way or another. I want to know if the other countries are providing similar guarantees. Are they taking the exact same approach as ourselves? There was a question of whether the South African Government wanted to engage in any further sports tournaments but is it making similar commitments? Where does the money go? Can someone tell me what will the GAA get from this? How much will the IRFU get from it? I have no problem with the IRFU getting money to put back in the game but what is the expected profit that would accrue to the IRFU? My only evidence is from previous tournaments, and our research office has given us the statistics. The last Rugby World Cup in 2015 in the UK had a net profit of £200 million. The World Rugby company accounts for 2015 showed profits that year of £189 million. Did all the money go to this offshore company? Is it also incorporated in the Isle of Man as well as Rugby World Cup Limited? Is that where all the profits from this venture will go? I do not deny that we want the tournament but I want to understand where the money is going.Where is the money going? That is one of the questions I would love to have the chance to ask. I appreciate the support earlier for my idea that if we are hosting a tournament where we are taking all the risk and providing an upfront cash contribution of €138 million, with no prospect of getting it back, and if the final is to be in the Aviva Stadium, the building to which we contributed €200 million via the Irish Rugby Football Union, we should avoid a position where Irish rugby supporters may have to pay Sky, BT, Eir or whoever for the pleasure of seeing the game. We will have already paid out our money to host the tournament so will we get to see it? I ask this because I have a general belief that this is a social question and it is good for the game of rugby. The bigger the audience, the better. There is real and detailed analysis over the years indicating that sports that adopted a privatised approach ended up losing their audience in the long run. They do not get a seven year old or ten year old watching it, which is not right. I am concerned because traditionally there were free-to-air broadcasts for every game. The Irish team games will be protected, along with the closing games, because they are on the list of games that must be free-to-air. With the World Cup in Japan in 2019, we will not be able to watch all the games unless we buy a pay-per-view service, which sends the signal that this is where the rugby authorities want to go. It is an inexorable shift that I have seen over the past 15 or 20 years towards privatisation and effectively giving the sport over to Rupert Murdoch and Sky, or whoever else is the highest bidder. I do not like it and it is not good for Irish rugby. Most of the speakers here seem to agree with that idea and I look forward to discussing the amendment when we get to it later and hearing the Minister's views. Going back to what I was saying about tax, and specifically the profit from 2015, we can see in the tax figures on the website where the accounts are presented that there was £189 million in profit. I do not have the detailed offshore accounts but the tax paid on income seems to be £71,000 from that £189 million in profit. I read with interest the Deloitte report commissioned by the team progressing this bid recently that set out the economic case; it was a very good case and I do not disagree with any of it. The stadiums are already built and we have great hospitality, so everything is set up. Towards the end of the document with regard to tax issues, it stated that in terms of the Rugby World Cup, for a number of reasons, it may well be the case that direct taxes would not be levied on the tournament company itself. I notice that in the Irish tax authorities' notices on 9 May this year, under section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, a host rugby union limited company was granted tax exemption status. Thousands of other Irish sports organisations get tax exemptions so it might not be particularly unusual, but I am asking the sort of questions that I think we should be asking so there can be transparency, which the organisers indicate is so essential to ensure the integrity of the host selection process. There are also the matters of commercial rights, copyright and trademark rights. It has been distinctively set out that we must agree with whatever arrangements Rugby World Cup Limited seeks to apply. One could understand that in a way. We might not foresee what could happen in five or six years as we are rushing through legislation without the proper opportunity to question the parties involved. We have heard about enough scandals in recent years. Poor old Ronaldo has been caught up in a tax problem arising from image rights, with €14 million in tax allegedly avoided. An Irish company facilitated that tax arrangement. I would like to know why the copyright issues are so sensitive. What is wrong with our copyright laws or international laws? What is special about the copyright and commercial rights that have been set out here? I could go on asking questions but I am conscious that we do not have much time and we must get through the amendments. We must go through all Stages in the next hour or so. I will go back to where I came from - Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned south Dublin rugby and I come from there and am proud of it. I am proud of the tradition and people involved with rugby at every level. I am proud to see young Munster supporters as much as those from Wanderers. I used to go to Donnybrook all the time and my favourite perch was just beside Mr. Con Houlihan. I heard the Deputies Healy-Rae - the Healy-Raes squared - mentioning Kerry men and he was my hero. If I had to cite one person as a hero as I grew up, it would be Con Houlihan. He was mad about rugby in that old Castleisland tradition. He was incredibly well respected. If one was with Con at a match, every person passing by would say "how are you Con?". He was loved by the people of this city and the country. What would Con Houlihan ask today? He would say the best of Irish rugby was the treasuring of the local and certain values. He would have loved the Rugby World Cup. He would have headed off with his duffel bag and the one change of clothes, if there was a change. My love of rugby goes down to that core and it started in the non-professional era. As I said, I am glad we have done so well and the team has been so good. I am referring to the IRFU, and the Leinster, Munster and Ulster branches. They deserve much credit for the way in which we can have incredible pride in what has happened in Irish rugby in the professional era. I want to see that continue and I do not want it enmeshed in an idea that we did not do as good a deal as we could or should have done because we did not give it the time, we were not transparent or we were not really fair as we set up this amazing opportunity to host the rest of the world and show off everything that is brilliant about rugby in this country. The Women's Rugby World Cup provides the exact same opportunity. I have a fear that we are rushing this and not answering some of the basic questions. I am sure some journalists will start to ask those questions - why would they not? Perhaps there is nothing there and there is no issue in what I have brought up. I would be thrilled if that was the case and it would be absolutely fine, but the questions are worth asking and it is unfortunate that we did not give it the time to tease it out in committee. That is what we are meant to do. We should have done pre-legislative scrutiny and brought in the rugby people and not just Department officials. They should come in to explain some of the nitty-gritty as they want this process to demonstrate transparency, fairness and professionalism.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	529	I know it is but it is a brief period. I will try to deal with some of the matters as quickly as possible. The first matter is the delay and the fact that we are coming so late to this, but let me make the position absolutely clear. Preliminary legal advice was given on 1 February, indicating that legislation was not likely to be required in respect of the State's contribution to a tournament company that might be established relating to the Rugby World Cup, subject to any policy consideration in terms of corporate governance that would merit legislation to govern this particular unique transaction. After further examination of the potential governance structures for staging a Rugby World Cup tournament in Ireland, a specific request for advice on vires was sent to the Attorney General on 3 April. Upon consideration of the vires of the Minister and after receipt of the draft guarantees from Rugby World Cup Limited on 7 April, the Attorney General's office advised on 4 May that express statutory authority through the passing of primary legislation is necessary for the Minister to provide capital support to any tournament company and provide the necessary guarantees to Rugby World Cup Limited in regard to payment of the tournament fee, underwriting of the tournament budget, and the provision of undertakings in regard to public sector supports. This is based on the judgment that there is no specific statutory support for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to expend money on or give guarantees directly for a unique major sporting event such as the Rugby World Cup in 2023. As this statutory authority must be in place before the Minister signs the guarantees on 31 July, the Bill had to be drafted since receipt of the advice and be passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess. We have moved as quickly as possible in light of the advice we got fairly late in the day. This is the wisest course of action we can possibly take. It is not really the 11th hour but it is certainly late in the day and we are giving as much time as we possibly can to it. Deputy Troy, and many other people, asked about the €200 million figure. It is not an exact figure; it is an approximate figure. We cannot tell exactly what the amount of the budget will be. It would be unrealistic to say that, but that is our estimation. On the idea that we are somehow on the line for €200 million, I want to kill that particular canard. We are not on the line for €200 million, unless we do not sell any tickets. If we do not sell any tickets, we are on the line for €200 million. We are on the line for €120 million. We are on the line for the tournament fee. We are on the line for €200 million, but only if we do not sell any tickets. Once the tickets revenue starts coming in, we start reducing that €200 million every single day. We will never have to pay out that sort of amount. That is the absolute maximum. On the question about the feasibility study and whether a lot of care was taken because there are no reliable projections, the study to which Deputy Ryan referred, which was the Deloitte study, was just one of many feasibility studies done. The working groups of the Government agencies North and South of the Border, and let us not forget that this is a North-South collaborative effort, which is one of the great aspects of it that we have understated here, have been set up and have reported regularly. They have done forensic work on this in terms of making projections, which are very conservative. They have looked at what happened in the United Kingdom and made judgments on that, but they have been more prudent than that. They have reduced the average price of tickets. They have looked also at the number of tourists who will be coming here for the Rugby World Cup and made very conservative projections on that. One Deputy asked how we got up to the figure of 445,000. The reason for that figure, and it is higher than the numbers that went to the UK, is because we are expecting, with reasonable logic, that we will get a huge number of people from the UK coming here. The people in the biggest rugby following nation in the world were not travelling to the UK because they were there already. We will get a huge bonus out of that, which presumably will fulfil and back up the sort of projections we have got, which are not overly optimistic. We must remember that the numbers that attended and the capacity filling of the stadiums in New Zealand and in the UK was well over 90%. There is no reason to believe those sorts of percentages will not be achieved here. We are very likely to achieve them. Let us not downplay that. As a result of the extraordinary effort and enthusiasm being put into it, North and South of the Border, we are confident that we will fill these stadiums and fulfil the ambitions of those who have put so much effort into this particular project.

Is that agreed? Agreed.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	533	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for that. I will deal with a few other questions. Deputy Troy and other Deputies asked about the hotel capacity and the accommodation. The accommodation situation is one which is constantly raised in terms of whether we have looked at it properly and accurately. I believe we have done that. Fáilte Ireland commissioned an assessment of the supply and demand for hotel accommodation in Dublin, which reflects the position up to December 2016. Although the results confirm the current shortage, to which a large number of Deputies referred, and there is a current shortage - let us be honest about it - it also indicates there should be sufficient stock, whether being developed currently or being planned, to meet projected demand in the future. The bulk of new stock is due to come on stream after 2018, with an estimated 6,000 rooms added by the end of 2020. We are confident that in the time available to us we will be able - it will be up to my successor and maybe his or her successor as well - to follow this through and project forward to provide a sufficient number of hotel rooms. We have got the warnings we have of this sort, but I do not believe there is too much danger. I will not give too many hostages to fortune, but because we have got the warning and should have the prescience, I believe we will be able to provide the hotel rooms. Currently, there is a problem. Deputy Boyd Barrett rightly asked about the 9% VAT rate. I am not sure that is particularly germane to the subject, but it is important to address it. The 9% VAT rate was introduced for a very good reason. It was to help the hospitality sector, which would be so important within the tourism sector. It helps the smaller restaurants and the smaller hospitality areas as well. Of course there are some people who get greater advantage from it than others. There are some people and institutions who will give us cause to examine this from time to time. It has given a great stimulus to smaller businesses. It has given employment to smaller businesses. That is a great success, but the large hotels in Dublin should not be allowed to milk that situation excessively. I take the Deputy's point, which is very important. On ticket prices, it is fair to say that the ticket model has a range of ticket prices that will make them affordable to all. Our projections, and I cannot give the Deputies all the details of that for commercial reasons, are based on ticket prices that are substantially lower than those charged in England in 2015. I want to make a general point on costs. The extensive study of costs has been ongoing since 2013. This is not some sort of new fly-by-night, ill-considered project. It has come to the House for the first time now, but this has been considered since 2012. It was open to us at any stage between 2012 and now to pull out and to look at the possible projections. The figures have been examined by highly reputable international companies without axes to grind. They have been examined by working groups from here and been revised generally and regularly. It would be absurd to say this is sudden. It is a sudden appearance in the Dáil, but the idea that in some way the nation is unprepared for this project is utterly misleading. I do not believe anyone wanted to give that impression, but that might be the impression given by the tone of some of the contributions. On transport links, that point was made and it is fair. The demands on infrastructure will be great at the time. There are probably gaps in the infrastructure. The National Transport Authority, NTA, has been involved at all stages in this project. By 2023, because of the capital review and the commitments we have made to transport, we are very optimistic that the transport, road and rail infrastructure will be greatly improved. There is no doubt that at the moment transport is inadequate and that the capital is lacking, but we are confident that we will provide infrastructure which will be more than sufficient to transport people around the country at that time. I will answer one or two questions raised by Deputy Ryan.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	538	I am sympathetic in terms of the amount of detail Deputy Ryan seeks. I will give him as much detail as possible, and when we come to Committee Stage I will do the same, but he has to realise that we are in a competitive situation. South Africa and France are watching what we are doing and saying and are competing with us for this particular bid.We cannot reveal everything out in the open at the moment about what our plans are, what the money is going to go on and how much we are bidding for certain for the sponsorship rights. That would be absolute madness. Transparency is fine and let us be absolutely transparent, but let us not commit commercial suicide by saying we are doing this, that and the other. We might as well ask the South African and French Governments to come and look at the books so they can then go and bid just a little bit more. I can understand the point but it is not something we can do at the moment. What we are being straightforward about is the guarantees we are giving, and the others are undoubtedly being asked for the same guarantees. We are being absolutely straightforward that we will pay the tournament fee of €120 million and we are being absolutely straightforward to World Rugby when they come here - I met them as well - about where our stadia are, what we are going to do with them and how much we are prepared to spend to upgrade them. However, do not expect us to tell the world what we are doing when there are other guys breathing down our throats and saying, "That is what they are doing. We will just bid them up by €1". That is not on. It is a never-never land and we are not going to go there, certainly not at the moment. That is not something the Deputy can possibly expect us to do. Confidentiality is important at this stage. If we want to win this bid, it is very important that we stick to confidentiality. I will certainly give the Deputy what I can but I do not think it is realistic to ask the Rugby World Cup body to come in here next week at the Deputy's particular whim. They will not be able to answer the sort of questions he is going to ask them. Most of the stuff they are dealing with is confidential. Is the Deputy going to ask them what the French and the others are bidding? He might as well. Come on. This is a contest we want to win. It is not a contest we want to just throw away in the interests of some sort of political adventure.

My amendment No. 3 on the issue of free-to-air television has been ruled out and is no longer on the schedule. The Minister heard the arguments on the part of just about everyone who spoke that this was a critical issue and that some of them would support it. Will he outline why that amendment has not been accepted? Perhaps it is the Clerk who decided this. Why has this been ruled out? I think television rights are central to the issue and I am astounded it has not been accepted as an amendment.

First, given this is the section dealing with the tournament company, I find it odd there was no answer as to why the company would be registered in the Isle of Man. Is that contrary to what is proposed, namely, that this be formed and registered under the Companies Act, which I presume relates to Ireland? Nonetheless, the Explanatory Memorandum states it will be registered in the Isle of Man, which I find odd. Second, there is nothing in the Bill about the profits. How will the profits be divided? Obviously, there will be three shareholders but we do not yet know what the proportion is between the Executive and the IRFU. What determines how that company works that out? How many people will be working for that company? There are questions to be answered. I will not delay the Bill but the Minister might reassure us as to the logic behind some of it. I understand the aspect mentioned by the Minister earlier concerning the need to have company secrecy while the bidding is going on. However, I see other amendments which propose that the Minister would come before the committees of the Oireachtas on a regular basis to fill in the blanks we will not get to today or on which the Minister cannot give an answer today.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	547	I assure the Deputy we have no indication it is. The world rugby company is registered in the Isle of Man but not the tournament company, which will not be registered in the Isle of Man. On the division of the profits, the shareholders will be the IRFU, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The tournament company is likely to be divided and an agreement will have to be reached between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government, but it is likely to be divided 88:12 in terms of distribution of profits. The IRFU may also share in the profits but that remains to be decided; it will have to have an input in order to share in the profits.

Thus far, the detail is lacking. It is taxpayers' money but yet again a blank cheque is being handed over to a private company. This will happen over a number of years and we are pretty much saying the company can use as much taxpayers' money as it sees fit. Given all of that, it is only right that the Dáil should have oversight and approval of exactly what the decision is going to be and what moneys are spent. There are no checks and balances at all, no accountability and nothing to stop spiralling charges or spurious spending. Perhaps the Minister will contradict what I am saying but, to my mind, those questions have not been answered satisfactorily.

As the Minister said, we are contributing €138 million no matter what, if we win the bid. We potentially have a liability of up to €200 million beyond that and there is possibly another commercial transaction in which we may be involved. Will the Minister provide clarity on one of his comments?He said we would start to recover some of our money as soon as we got ticket sales. Is this the only source of revenue that would accrue to the State? Would the revenue from other licensing, television, sponsorship, hospitality and all those other arrangements accrue to the State as well or is getting money back for the State or not having to provide for that indemnity dependent solely on ticket sales? Is all the revenue of the event likely to accrue to the one pot? Is it possible that Rugby World Cup Limited would hold onto some of the commercial rights and not see them go to the joint company between the IRFU, the State and the Northern Ireland Executive? I want this clarified before we sign up to €348 million without knowing what the risk is or where is the actual exposure.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	551	The Minister might be somewhat surprised that I do not support these amendments. I do not believe we as a Parliament should tie the Government's hands behind its back in terms of what it can underwrite to win this venture. We have to be conscious of the fact an unbelievable amount of work has been done on the bid, going back to November 2012 when Deloitte sports business group conducted a feasibility study on it. I met the IRFU in my capacity as party spokesperson. I understand Deputy Ryan's frustration on the need for greater interaction between Members of the Oireachtas and the IRFU, and he is right. The IRFU was due to come before the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport to speak specifically on this issue but as many of our committee meetings were taken up with the strike in Bus Éireann, the meeting with the IRFU was deferred on a number of occasions and it is regrettable it did not have an opportunity to come before the committee. I have a suggestion for the Minister, which may be helpful and beneficial. Will the Minister quantify the benefits and how we as a country can stand to gain from hosting the Rugby World Cup? He has alluded to our tickets being at a reduced rate compared with what was charged in the UK, and because of this, he believes we would get a greater number of visitors. He needs to quantify the spending power of the visitors and the research that has been conducted on it. This might help alleviate some of the fears of my colleagues. I ask the Minister to correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that each of the three remaining countries that have put forward a bid would have to stump up €120 million if it won the bid.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	552	That is right.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	553	That is the fee we would have to pay to hold the Rugby World Cup here. It is after this we must ensure we underwrite the costs associated with running it. The Minister is right. I do not believe we can clearly specify what we are prepared to spend at a time we are engaging in a competitive tender. Effectively, everything we say here this evening is a matter of public record. It would not take an Albert Einstein from the French or South African bids to look at the record of the Dáil to see what the Irish Government is prepared to spend to host the Rugby World Cup. I agree with the Minister on this. To be helpful for colleagues who do not have the benefit of the information we do, the Minister should quantify the benefits of holding the Rugby World Cup here, in terms of increased employment, revenue and tax take. Will the Minister clarify the situation with regard to the Northern Ireland Executive? Will it cross-guarantee this? Are we guaranteeing the full amount in the absence of the Assembly being in operation?

I am 100% behind Ireland's bid for the Rugby World Cup because I recognise it will open up a whole load of opportunities, particularly longer lasting opportunities in tourism. As well as the bid itself, infrastructure will be needed to back it and support for this will be necessary. For example, we will have the new stadium in Páirc Uí Chaoimh and we have Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney, and people would be going back and forth between them. Right in the middle, a glaring piece of infrastructure is needed on the N22 at the Macroom bypass. It is essential that this be built and funding be committed to it. The capital mid-term review will be undertaken in coming weeks and months. It is absolutely essential that the Minister commits funding for the bypass in order that people can move through Macroom.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	561	On the Macroom bypass the answer is "No". I will not give such an assurance under the heading of this Bill. At another time I would speak to the Deputy about that issue, but under the heading of this Bill I have no intention of giving such an assurance, and the Deputy does himself no favours by raising such an issue under this Bill, quite honestly. It is not helpful. On the issue raised by Deputy Troy with regard to Northern Ireland, as he is aware it is slightly complicated by the situation there because there is no Executive. There will be a deal with Northern Ireland, and it is a question of exactly how it will be arranged in the absence of a Government there. The Government here is prepared and we will probably do a deal with Northern Ireland that will mean we are the people who actually take primary responsibility. Talks are ongoing in Belfast to reform the Northern Ireland Executive. However, the Executive has been supporting the bid since 2014, in conjunction with the Government, and is co-funding the bid. All five main parties in Northern Ireland have expressed their support in writing for hosting the tournament. Despite the fact they are out of power they wrote a letter stating they are fully behind the tournament at present. I am confident when the Executive is reformed, we will come to a mutual agreement on staging the tournament across the island, and the Secretary of the State is supportive of the Bill. The arrangement that will be made will depend on the political and Government situation up there but an arrangement will be made and we are absolutely certain it will be binding. I will speak about the benefits of hosting in response to Deputy Troy. It is difficult to quantify it in monetary terms because we do not know what the revenue would be. The tourism potential would be considerable. It would take place during Ireland's shoulder season for overseas tourism, which would be a great advantage, as it is a time when tourism begins to flag a bit. It will take place in the autumn, between mid-September and October, when tourism is not at its highest point. It will be an added benefit.The direct economic return of hosting the tournament here would be primarily derived from spending by overseas visitors. Based on the travel patterns relating to the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England, there would be an estimated 445,000 overseas visitors with a total direct spend across the island of €760 million - in 2023 prices - and a tax return to the Irish Exchequer of €138 million. These are conservative projections. However, we are talking a really serious benefit which is not reflected immediately in the tournament budget or fee. Hosting Rugby World Cup 2023 would also generate many other benefits such as community pride and engagement, capacity-building of volunteers, an activation programme of festivals and cultural events, business networking and opportunities, promotion and participation in sport, as well as increased physical activity with consequent health benefits. Rugby, and sport in general, will benefit from the tournament’s domestic legacy, including in the form of investment in the enhancement of existing stadia. There are also the intangibles. How much benefit will this be to the nation as a whole over a long period? The branding of the country will improve. How many repeat visitors will we get? Based on a response to a survey in the UK, the figures for the likelihood of people paying return visits to the country after they had been there increased. The long-term benefits will be enormous. Deputy Eamon Ryan asked about the other forms of income. We can bid for commercial rights. Rugby World Cup does not have to sell them to us, but we can bid for them. This is a sensitive area and perhaps the Deputy will understand that. I did not mean to be too hard on the Deputy about commercial rights. However, it is difficult to say whether we are involved in it because it is open to bidding from all three nations. Several rights held by Rugby World Cup, such as selected sponsorship categories and hospitality licensing, are on offer for potential hosts to bid. We will only be bidding for them if we believe they make commercial sense and we can get more revenue from them. That is open to us. Negotiations are ongoing and rival bidders are also expected to bid. No figures have been agreed. Rugby World Cup will examine the bids. If it chooses to accept the offers, subject to bidder being awarded the hosting rights, then the details will have to be finalised by the middle of September. Rugby World Cup may decide not to sell any of these rights. The provisions of sections 3 and 4 grant the Minister all potential options to support any purchase of these rights and to structure it in such a way that would be of best advantage to the State and the tournament. We cannot reveal our hand to competitors and weaken our chances of winning the bid. Deputy Munster spoke about the need for controls. I take her point about it being a blank cheque. The Deputy is correct that it is a large figure in anybody’s terms. The likelihood of the cheque ever being cashed is pretty small. What we are providing is a guarantee. We are still talking about a €300 million plus figure but only in the event of no tickets being sold. It is a fair comment to pluck that figure out and claim it is the ultimate liability. The likelihood of that happening is small. The projections, which are conservative, suggest, on the basis of the past record, that we should make a surplus of some sort. That would be tremendous. That is a straightforward profit not taking into account the intangibles which I have also spoken about such as tourism and tax benefits. The governance framework is important. The IRFU will be the contracting party and signatory to the hosting agreement as required by Rugby World Cup. A local organising committee will be established as a designated activity company to deliver the tournament. There will be a shareholders’ agreement between all parties which sets out the reporting arrangements, governance structures, reserved matters, step-in rights and the treatment of any tournament surplus and shortfall. Robust controls and monitoring processes adopting best practice principles will be put in place for the local organising committee's operations and recognising the support to be provided by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. Experienced major events personnel will be appointed by the local organising committee and empowered with day-to-day operational responsibility. An agreement will be put in place between the Governments in regard to the tournament fee and budget guarantee. Those are strict and stringent corporate governance requirements.

I understand the Deputy’s amendment because she wants more accountability and for the Dáil to approve these provisions. The purpose of the Bill is to seek Dáil approval to enable the Minister give the guarantees required by 31 July. The first amendment undermines the purpose of the legislation. It would not be possible to revert to the Dáil in that time because it would be in recess. I have no real difficulty at all about reporting to anybody what I can commercially report at any time. I do not want to come back to an Oireachtas committee every week to say the same thing. That is pointless. However, I have absolutely no problem in being as open as possible about this with anyone. Despite what was said by several Members today, we are all on the same side. There is a huge national effort. We spoke about the GAA and others, but it is also a North-South, all-party and all-group effort. Deputy Eamon Ryan was the only Member to vote against it tonight. Good luck to him, and that is fine. However, there is a willingness on my part to be as open as possible. Deputy Eamon Ryan asked questions to which I do not know the answers. I deliberately do not want to know those answers. It is better that I do not know them because they relate to competitive issues about which I do not need to know.

He has accused us of not treating this bid fairly. We all knew this bid was coming down the tracks for several years. It is because of the Minister that we are here tonight asking questions. He did not afford us the chance to have pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation in the respective committee. It annoys me when the Minister throws the buck back at us. It is not our fault. We are just trying to be honest Teachtaí Dála and be seen to be working on behalf of the electorate as much as the sporting organisations in question. Will the Minister be seeking to take out an insurance bond in the financial markets to safeguard our Exchequer funding relating to the underwriting of the tournament? Will the issue of clean stadiums arise?Obviously, as one can see, many existing stadiums have sponsorship and hoarding. Will all the stadiums have to be stripped clean so the world rugby union will be able to get its own advertisers onto all the sites at the expense of companies such as SuperValu, which advertise in Croke Park, for example?

Deputy Munster has an amendment to insert "and subject to approval by vote of Dáil Éireann" after "Finance". Deputy Ryan's amendment is to insert ", up to a limit of €100 million," after "support". Let us focus on those.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	567	I voted against proceeding to Committee Stage because I do not like the process. I was not voting against the Bill per se but I was certainly voting against the process. I was shocked to hear the Minister say he did not want to know details of this scheme, for whatever reason. If I were in his job, I would want to know every single detail and aspect. His job is to represent the public interest in this. I am concerned about that. The Minister said in his last contribution that the estimated tax return is €138 million. Is he misreading that? That is the exact same figure as the estimated bid cost. That is just a small technical issue. With regard to the company in respect of which we are connecting with the IRFU and Rugby World Cup Limited, in addition to the indemnity we have, the only revenue source we know we have to cover the costs - we are covering all the costs — is ticket sales. If we buy the commercial rights and sell them on, we might have some other revenue but that comes with another cost. I want to check that my interpretation of the Minister's statement is correct in this regard. Let me outline the problem I have. Everyone would agree that the real benefit of this tournament is that the eyes of the world will be upon us in the sense that Ireland is a welcoming place where it is expected a really good time will be had by all. We have to be careful to ensure the ticket prices remain really low. The Minister said they will be lower than in the UK. In the UK, prices at football matches are typically a scandal. We should be doing what the GAA is doing in this regard. One can bring one's child to a stadium for €15 and have a really good day out at minimal cost. What I propose is particularly necessary if we are making all the money upfront and taking all the risk. We do not want visitors coming here and feeling stung. I am slightly concerned that we are covering all the costs while the only revenue protection we have is through ticket sales. Based on this, there might be a perverse incentive for us to set high ticket prices to cover the risk because no one wants us to make a loss. Last but not least, my reference to €100 million in my amendment concerns the additional liability. It recognises what Deputy Troy said earlier. Everyone knows about the upfront fee. I believe it is very high. That is accepted. It is a question of a guarantee. With my reference to €100 million, I was trying to impose a limit. Why is the limit to which the Minister refers €200 million? What if there were a problem with one of the stadiums, for example? If there were a structural problem and an obligation to hold the event, we might have to reconfigure the stadium in some way through engineering works. This could easily run up a significant bill. Is there potential to go above €200 million in respect of the additional indemnity to cover the cost? Have we capped our risk at €200 million? If the Minister does not agree with the figure of €100, which I have mentioned, does he have any limit in respect of the risk? I acknowledge that we could insure against a problem with a stadium or an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, for example, but I am interested in knowing whether there is a limit. Why is the Minister quoting the figure of €200 million as the additional contribution we might have to make?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	568	I can understand the Deputy's concern. The figure of €100 million that he mentioned is very small in terms of what it could be required for. We have capped the figure. I cannot tell where we have capped it, for reasons he can understand. If he wants me to tell him, he will just sabotage the Bill. He cannot have it both ways. If he wants me to tell him things like that, he will tell the opposition. If he wants me to do that, he should say so. Otherwise, he should tell me to keep my mouth shut. I am keeping my mouth shut on that. We have a cap but I will not tell the Deputy what it is, as he will understand. For him to demand that I tell him is unrealistic. It is absolutely out of the question. Ticket sales are our only source of revenue at the moment. That is definitely the case. With regard to the statements of Deputy O'Keeffe, we either have or will be taking out cancellation insurance. That is part of the budget, for obvious reasons. It is quite normal for it to happen in this case. Insurance is taken out to mitigate the risk of a disaster of one sort or another. I do not want to mention what it might be but the Deputy can imagine it himself. Therefore, I dare say we will probably take out cancellation insurance. It is a commitment we have made. It is in the budget also. I shall address the two amendments at this stage, if that is in order.

The amendment would, therefore, fundamentally undermine the guarantees as World Rugby would have no certainty that the Government could deliver on its commitments. The proposed first amendment would completely undermine Ireland's bid and create the very uncertainty the legislation is designed to resolve. I am grateful to Deputy Munster for indicating she will withdraw it. The second amendment places a limit on the amount of the guarantee. The limit falls short of the tournament budget that the State must underwrite. Accepting the amendment would totally undermine the bid.

We just supported the Minister in respect of providing support for a person who will make a bid for commercial rights, with the result that the State could purchase those commercial rights. It is slightly strange. Is the State going to bid for the commercial rights and then sell them on or sub-let them to others? At the same time, because of subsection 3(c), one has to support the person to bid for those commercial rights. I am slightly confused by this aspect. If the State has the commercial right to sell the tickets, it might then say it does not have the expertise. As we have seen from Brazil, we definitely do not have the expertise to sell tickets and prevent ticket gouging, or even to prevent ticket-----

All I am asking about is what the State, under section 4, is going to do. The Minister already mentioned that the State is subject to commercial sensitivity requirements so I am not asking him to divulge any information in this regard, but in the event of the State winning some of the commercial rights, will it sub-let them and give them to a private company to do with them what it may? Since we already know the State has the right regarding ticket sales - that is the key commercial right it will have, without going any further, if it wins the bid - is this an area where we can influence the Minister once the bid is won to have him put in place specific restrictions?We are not looking for it in the Bill because we do not know which commercial rights the Minister has. However, in that event, will the Minister give a commitment that the House will have some discussion with the Minister before those rights are sold on or let to another company? That is just to make sure some of the debacles in ticket sales in other tournaments we have seen where tickets have been sold twice or stadiums have not been full do not happen here. There might be franchising rights to do with who supplies food in the venues. I am not sure. All I am asking is that the Minister would have that discussion prior to a bidding process for commercial rights that the State may engage in in the future.

We are told in response that we would be selling out to the French if the Minister were to answer. It is tricky. I will try again. This issue of commercial rights is important. Given that we already have risk on the downside of €338 million or possibly more, as the Minister has recognised, although he will not declare what the final exposure we might have could be, why would we take on further risk to buy commercial rights that we do not necessarily have expertise in? Why would we buy, for example, the television rights with a view to selling them on to television companies? What gain would we have on that other than taking all the risk again? We might make a few bob. In those circumstances, we might need to do it to ensure there is a free-to-air aspect to the television broadcasting in Ireland for fear that someone else selling the rights might mean we would not have that control over it. Why would the State take further risk? Are there specific things the State wants to have control over in terms of hospitality, sponsorship or commercial television rights? I would be surprised if there are. I do not see how this breaches the confidentiality of our bid versus the French or the South Africans. Does the GAA get anything from this process and from the revenue, commercial or otherwise, coming in? Does the IRFU get any revenue? Is it doing this pro bono on an altruistic basis for the good of the State? If it is, that is fine. I do not need to know the figure, but is the GAA getting anything out of it, for example? I do not think that impinges on our bid against the French or the South Africans, but it would be good for GAA supporters to know what the GAA is doing.

In response to Deputy Ó Snodaigh's question about the commercial rights, we can decide to keep them outside the company to get the best return. The option to keep it outside the company is available if we think there could be a better return. However, I am not making any judgments on that. I suppose that answers Deputy Ryan's question as well. I am not making any judgments on what decision will be made. For good reason, we have got the option to bid for the rights. We do not have to take it if we do not want the risk. It is going to be a purely commercial decision taken by people who will be in a position to judge whether it is to our advantage. It may be right or wrong like all commercial decisions, but at least we have got that particular option. That is probably all.

Again, these amendments were designed to protect the State from a blanket guarantee of the use of State services. As I said before, this section is open ended and extremely vague. For example, it gives a blanket guarantee that we will provide all such services when anything could happen in the interim or at that time for which we could not guarantee the provision of services. Would that leave the State liable to World Rugby? Would it leave us exposed to that? What mechanisms do we have, such as insurance, to ensure that if such a scenario arose, the State would be protected? Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are tied together and are designed to protect the interests of the State. What protections do we have there? The information was not forthcoming in either the Minister's response or in any questions answered thus far.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	603	I asked on Second Stage about the guarantee of the public services element of the bid. It is regrettable that the Minister took a potshot at my colleague, Deputy Moynihan, who perhaps raised a slightly lenient point. He does not have the 34 years' Oireachtas experience the Minister has to know where to raise a genuine concern. The Minister will have to invest in infrastructural improvements, I assume, in support of this bid. Will the Minister indicate what infrastructural improvements and investments we are talking about? Is it broadband, increased public transport, investment in road infrastructure or what?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	604	In response to Deputy Munster, we very carefully drafted our undertakings to reflect the services we are confident we can deliver. I am reluctant to accept these amendments because of the dilutive effect they would have by inserting "whilst taking the needs of the State into consideration" into the Bill. Deputy Troy asked about the broad areas of public sector involvement.That is what the Deputy wants to know about. I am sorry if I was rude or in any way abrupt with Deputy Moynihan. I apologise for that. I did not mean to be. I was just somewhat irritated by the time being taken on a local issue but I know the Deputy has to do what he has to do and I have to do what I have to do. I will apologise to him when I meet him. It relates to a guaranteed payment for the tournament fee, security matters, Garda resources for matches and fan zones, Garda escorts for teams, protection of commercial rights, including trademark and intellectual property protection, which was already referred to, clean zones around match venues that are free from non-tournament branding and sponsors, measures to tackle ambush marketing and unauthorised ticket sales, transportation capacity both internal and external, which is what Deputy Troy is referring to, communications capacity involving the broadcasting and broadband infrastructure as well as use of radio frequencies, anti-doping controls, visas for players, officials and spectators, tourism, the promotion of the tournament, accommodation, supporting parallel festivals and events, local authority assistance with local activation, involving the setting up of fan zones and traffic management-----

The Minister is looking to have six-monthly intervals in his subsequent amendment so I will withdraw my amendment. However, I would make the point that this issue of transparency and the role of this House in overseeing, invigilating and scrutinising these kind of bids and this kind of process is something we should stand by and with. I expect absolute and utter transparency. I expect the IRFU and Rugby World Cup Limited to come in next week and, if not then, as soon as possible after they return from New Zealand or wherever they are. They need to come in to answer questions. We have an absolute right in this regard. If they have to say it is commercially sensitive or someone must step in and say that we cannot ask a question, that is fine, but this House has a role in scrutinising legislation on behalf of the public. We need to do that. The Minister's amendment seems to cater for what I was looking for in the Bill so I will withdraw my amendment on that basis.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	610	I move amendment No. 6a:In page 4, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:
"Report of Minister
7. If the bid to host the tournament is successful, the Minister shall, during each period of 6 months thereafter until the conclusion of the tournament, report on preparation for and the staging of the tournament to the committee appointed by either House of the Oireachtas or jointly by both Houses to examine matters and make recommendations in relation to tourism and sport.".I am very pleased to move this amendment. It is in direct response to some of the amendments that have been moved by Deputy Munster and the co-operation and genuine desire I have to respond to the kind of constructive suggestions that have been made this evening. I am very anxious to ensure this is transparent, and to demonstrate that willingness, I have to come forward and report regularly on whatever Deputies want to hear about what is ongoing. I do realise that this is not just a project which everyone is supporting willy-nilly and we are not just doing it without accountability. I do realise that it is certainly my job and that of my successor to report to this House.

I understand that because this is a line spend in the Department, when the Minister comes before the Oireachtas committee on a quarterly basis, as he does anyway, we could investigate and question him about this. I understand that because it is part of the Department's spend, it comes under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General and it also comes under the scrutiny of the Committee of Public Accounts. While it is the Minister's prerogative to put forward an amendment to address amendments moved by two Deputies on this side of the House, I ask him to clarify that this expenditure is under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General and that the Committee of Public Accounts can investigate it if there is any issue. As members of the Oireachtas committee, we have the opportunity to raise it on a quarterly basis with the Minister anyway regardless of this amendment.
