          <p eId="para_10">I understand the Government wants to introduce emergency legislation, the Road Traffic Bill 2003, to allow gardaí to breathalyse people in a number of circumstances, particularly in the run up to Christmas. The Leader may be assured that we will support that legislation tomorrow. However, the Minister for Transport made this announcement last Wednesday. He then went to the Statute Book, had a look at it and realised that he had made a botch of the legislation last year when he brought it to the House. He is now introducing this emergency legislation. To use the Leader's words in advice to the Minister, will he ever get his finger out on this issue? He must get real on this. Can the Leader tell me if the Minister, who has had to perform this last minute about face, will come into the House tomorrow? He seems to view the House as a disease-ridden place. He has not been seen here for the last 12 months.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">When will the Government speak with one voice? The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, is now bleeding his heart dry about community employment. Other Government Deputies are saying they do not want any more cutbacks. I heard one of them this morning in his own constituency bellyaching about the problems concerning the lack of sup port being given to young mothers whose children attend crèches. The latest attack on the Tánaiste about stem cell research comes from within the ranks of the Government. When will the Government speak with one voice? This has more to do with the upcoming elections and the fact that Fianna Fáil not only wants to be the Government, but also the Opposition.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">As regards fraud in financial services, particularly credit card fraud, about a year ago it was indicated to us in the House that the Government had been in talks with the financial institutions to protect against credit card fraud. People who use credit cards in most of the rest of Europe are required to input a personal identification number in the store or retail outlet to ensure the process is not dependent on an illegible signature. I met a man recently who said that instead of signing his own name, he had signed the name Mickey Mouse on ten successive credit card transactions and that no one had noticed. The transaction was accepted on each occasion. I am sure Senator Quinn agrees that there is a huge amount of fraud being perpetrated with credit cards. There is an easy solution to it, which is in place in other parts of Europe. Why is it not possible to have a system here where people, who use their credit cards, input a code or number in the same way as they do when withdrawing money? That would get rid of those people who steal credit cards and then use them incorrectly. I would like a Minister to come into the House to explain why that is not the case  because the authorities have other crimes with which to deal.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_26">The Governor of Mountjoy, John Lonergan, has been quoted in the newspapers as saying that the last thing the prison service wants is an industrial dispute. He spoke about the repercussions and the damage it would cause in the prison and to the lives and already difficult work of prison officers. We heard this morning that the prison staff will not get the benchmarking increases in the new year. We also heard about the proposal to close prisons, such as Spike Island which was given a large investment recently. There is no apparent reason why Spike Island should be closed. It seems there is a major crisis looming in the prison service. I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House to tell us what he is doing to ensure the prison service does not take industrial action and that issues, such as the overtime bill, are addressed in a way which is fair to prison officers and which recognises the difficult work they do.</p>

When will remedial action be taken? This is becoming a national issue. I ask the Leader to convey our concerns to the appropriate Minister. Perhaps we could have a debate on the issue.

I am sure the Leader agrees that the Minister has acted quickly to introduce legislation to ensure there are no challenges at a later stage. Publicity is vitally important, particularly in the run up to Christmas when many accidents occur due to drink driving. Statistics have shown that when a road safety publicity campaign is undertaken, lives are saved. I welcome anything which can be done in this House or in the other House to ensure a high level of publicity is generated.</p>

Who makes the decision about when we should adopt the policy of handcuffing criminals? I understood it was traditionally the case that four groups of people were not visibly handcuffed, namely, children, old people, women and soldiers in uniform. If that policy has been changed for certain occasions – perhaps it is a good decision – was the decision made at a political level? I remember at least two women who were found  guilty of murder in recent years and who were escorted without handcuffs. If a decision has been made to handcuff those who are found guilty and who are escorted, was it made at a political level or by the local prison officer? If that decision adds to the ignominy of a criminal, that is good. However, we must ensure that decision is made at a political level rather than being adopted from the American system without any thought.</p>

It is regrettable that the Minister does not incorporate in that Bill his intention to introduce more speed cameras around the country. As Members know, we have three speed cameras. Some time ago the Minister indicated he would expand that number to between 100 and 150 and outsource it. However, he has recently discovered that legislation is required to do this and it is regrettable that he must introduce <i>ad hoc</i> legislation. It is a pity that aspect is not incorporated in the legislation tomorrow. The Minister is good for soundbites, but when he is making statements like that he should know whether legislation is required before going off on a tangent.</p>

They are surveying motorists to establish where such cameras are effective. The high visibility of cameras slows down motorists and this should be the emphasis as opposed to catching people out, as this may be counterproductive.</p>

On the comments on military equipment, we had a good debate in the House on the mission to Liberia  and received assurances that the troops would be properly equipped. No one would have more serious concerns in this regard than I, which is why I called for an ongoing debate on the mission while our troops are there. If occasions arise where equipment needs must be re-evaluated, this should be done and funds should be made available. Attached to the decision to send troops to Liberia is the political commitment to follow through and ensure their safety at all times. I hope the House continues to monitor this.</p>

I would like the Leader to take up the issue of driving licences and the delay in the driving test with the Minister for Transport. This relates to a certain sector of the population, particularly in rural areas. People are driving with full no-claims bonuses but do not have a licence because they did not renew it within the allotted time. What is the difference between me, who renewed my licence in time, and somebody who has been driving all his or her life and has not renewed it on time? Those people are currently stranded. They have no licence and are not allowed to drive unless they are accompanied. The Minister should excuse those people and grant them their licences. They are largely middle aged and elderly  people who have been driving all their lives and hold full no-claims bonuses. They are entitled to their licences and it is only because of a bureaucratic hiccup that they did not renew them on time. This issue has nothing to do with road safety and needs to be addressed as it inconveniences thousands of people throughout the country.</p>

The Central Bank has recognised a practice where these credit institutions allow young people to borrow large amounts using one-off bonuses that may or may not continue over time. This means the people in question are extending themselves far beyond what they would normally undertake in light of the low interest rates. However, due to the breach in the Stability and Growth Pact, there is a strong threat of a rise in interest rates. It would be good if this House could put down a marker for young people and have a debate on this issue that would explain the dangers that could arise. This would also warn the credit institutions not to allow young people to over-extend themselves. On a borrowing of €200,000, a 1% increase could cost a lot of money and put people in trouble. We have a duty to warn people of this.</p>

It is a privilege to have Mr. McCartin here today to address the House under Standing Order 52(A).</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_132" as="#Leas-Chathaoirleach">
          <from>Mr. McCartin, MEP</from>
          <p eId="para_153">I am happy to be here. I was not always enthusiastic about the idea that had much currency at one time, that Members of the European Parliament should have a right to speak in the national Parliament. I never felt strongly about it. In fact, I have always believed that one level of democracy has as much legitimacy as another. At local government level, representatives have their seats, competences and functions. The same applies at national and European levels. With regard to the idea that MEPS should have the automatic right to speak in the Dáil or the Seanad, I believed it was an effort to assert that the national Parliament had the last say, regardless of the constitutional decisions that have been taken and the compentences we have decided to share with neighbouring countries. It is a hangover from the traditional family situation where the father took the decisions and that never changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">However, the world does change a great deal. I have always believed deeply in the European  ideal. I was excited about it from the first time I heard about it. At the time I was a young member of Macra na Feirme. I recall my disappointment when Ireland was not accepted as a member because the British application went wrong. According to Professor Joe Lee's history, "Ireland 1912-1985", our first application was not studied by the European Union. The then Government did not reveal that. Although the European Union at the time was still quite vulnerable it did not believe that Ireland had reached a point where it could join and be an equal member of the partnership of European countries. It was a failure of understanding on its part but it is a great tribute to the Irish people that Ireland has come so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">In any case, I was disappointed that Ireland could not join. I have not forgotten what I said when I first spoke on Europe in this Chamber. I said I was not working to replace the old god of nationalism with a new god of Europe. I wanted to see democracy for mankind and I saw a united Europe as a first achievable step in that. I still believe that. I was never greatly impressed by the question of sovereignty. While we enjoyed our sovereignty over the years we had no hesitation in sending our children to the hiring fairs of Europe and North America. It was a poor sovereignty that created a situation in which we could not provide livelihoods for our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Some people want a federal Europe, others talk about a super-state while others refer to a Europe of the nations. I am not interested in any of those concepts. The European Union is the greatest effort at human co-operation ever undertaken. The question is how to organise it. Obviously, we are committed to organising it on a democratic basis. What is important now is the decision on the compentences we wish to give the European Union. Subsidiarity was written into the Maastricht treaty. This means that decisions should be taken at the appropriate level of government. I regularly tell young people that when I started my career there were two levels of government; now there are three.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">Some duties, competences and offices of government can be more usefully discharged at European level. It is obvious that there should be common regulations relating to trade, the environment, fisheries and the free movement of people. Those regulations can be more efficiently made through the governments of Europe setting up democratic institutions for making those decisions. However, that does not mean we cannot look at those policies from time to time and decide to re-arrange competences.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Regional policy will always exist. It must always be in place because economic development will ebb and flow and regions can become poor. In a huge Single Market it is obvious that there will always be a need, just as there is in member states, to make an effort to redistribute wealth and opportunity within the regions. We need a strong regional policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I do not foresee the agricultural policy, as it currently exists, being needed forever. Agriculture will evolve over time into something more like a good rural development programme. The present direction agriculture is taking will keep the policy in place for the next ten years or a little longer. The size of the budget is not in question. The commitment of resources to the Common Agricultural Policy is not likely to be withdrawn in the foreseeable future. However, it will be used more as an instrument for the enhancement of rural areas and to prevent desertification and the depopulation of huge areas of the member states. Things can change as time passes.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The agriculture industry in Ireland has been particularly fortunate in that the CAP fitted, as we used to say. The policy was not necessarily economically wise or socially just. In fact, one could not describe it as one or the other because it gave a great deal to the rich and much less to the poor. Small farmers got less than big farmers. Nevertheless, Ireland happened to produce the right products and the policy suited us. People have regularly forecast that Ireland will become a net contributor to the EU in three or four years. That has not yet happened. The reason is that Irish agriculture still attracts a level of assistance from Europe that puts Ireland's net position well into the black. In fact, Ireland is the biggest net recipient of European funds at present. It is approaching €400<i>per capita</i>, which is a large amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">In 2001, a total of €760 million came to Ireland through Structural Funds. Those funds will diminish, of course, but Ireland also received more than €1,700 million from various agricultural programmes. Assuming that total agricultural income in Ireland is €2 billion, 80% of the income of Irish farmers is paid directly from the European Union. I have read a paper produced by the Cato Institute in the United States, an international economic study organisation and forum for debating, which claims the subsidies that have come to the various regions of Europe through the CAP have been counterproductive. However, it recognises the immense progress Ireland has made in the Union and puts it down to the freedoms that Europe has brought to the Single Market.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">We received a great deal of money from the Structural Funds. Most people in the European Union believe we made good use of that money and that Ireland is a good example of the success of European regional policy. I take a different view. There is no question we received the money. If the money had just been posted to us <i>per capita</i>, per townland or whatever, it would have had a beneficial effect on the economy. If one looks at the trend in public spending one will see that between 1982 and 1992, when the European Structural Funds matured from almost nothing to €1,000 million a year, the highest figure reached, the public capital programme decreased in nominal terms by €10 million or €15 million from €1,800 million. Due to inflation, the  public capital programme was reduced in real terms by 30%. This was when the Structural Funds flowed into Ireland. We must acknowledge that the money did not go into the public capital programme, even though we see notices to this effect throughout the country. The money found its way into public sector pay and social welfare benefits. I discussed the issue at the time with public servants and I got wide agreement from people who understood what happened. This took place during the terms of office of different Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">However, our economy grew. I always believed that the Single Market gave us freedom to trade. The political assistance we got from Europe helped us to stand up to the old monopolies that had oppressed the Irish economy from the foundation of the State and gave us the lowest economic growth recorded in western Europe in the period from 1925 or 1930 to 1965. When Ireland began to open up its market in the 1960s one could see that Irish people were just as competitive and keen to make progress as everyone else. What Ireland achieved is wonderful and I do not believe we could have done it without the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">I worry about the holding of a referendum on the treaty – this applied to the Single European Act, the Maastricht treaty, the Treaty of Nice and the Amsterdam treaty – because it is so easy to confuse the public. When the public is faced with a long complicated question, it sometimes tends to vote on the basis of how the economy is performing, how favourably it looks on the Government or who puts the question rather than what is the question. However, we must accept this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">The question of sovereignty and our right to self-determination arises frequently. I do not have to remind older Members that when we joined the European Union we were told that we had just achieved some kind of sovereignty, independence and freedom and that we would now throw it all away. What we achieved was the right to decide for ourselves how to organise our future. The decision to join the European Union was a wise one. I was speaking last week to a pro-Europe section of the British Conservative Party in Guildford. I explained that I believed the people of Norway, who rejected membership of the European Union, had been deceived by their own government.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">When Norway joined Schengen and the Free Trade Agreement with the European Union, it accepted all the rules of the Single Market. In fact, Norway accepted the laws other people made while it had no say. Later a lady approached me from the audience and said that they had a little discussion group and someone referred to Norway as the fax democracy. In other words, it was a reference to people who get their laws on the fax machine from Brussels.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">Apart from Belgium and Luxembourg, Ireland is the most open economy in Europe. However, we must accept the regulations laid down by our  trading partners on standards, quality and so on. It is inevitable in a single market that regulations are not always understood by the public, therefore, regulations are drawn up at national level as well as at European level. The effort Members have made in inviting us here today to explain the European Union as we see it will help to bring the message of what Europe is all about down through the political system in Ireland. It will help the message to become better understood by local people through the newspapers and local radio.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">I want to refer to the European Union budget. I used to work in the agriculture area but when the former MEP, Alan Gillis, became a member I moved from agriculture to the budget committee. The budget of the European Parliament is so small that it is not very important in the context of the European economy. It does not affect to any great extent unemployment figures or the strength of the currency. There is no over-spending or borrowing. The European Union controls just 1% of GDP of the European Union. My understanding is that the American Federal Government takes approximately 16% or 17% of the national resources. Ireland currently takes approximately 35% or 36%, which is a big decrease. The average figure for Europe is closer to 40% but the European Union gets just 1%, some 40% of which is spent on agriculture, approximately 30% on Structural Funds and 5% on administration. We have a small figure amounting to approximately €5 billion – some people would call this significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">I do not believe there is a need to organise agriculture down to the last detail at European level. The agriculture industry which I tried to defend is not the same today. We can see how it is evolving and how it will involve a different type of policy in the future. However, I would like changes in the whole area of development co-operation. The European Union contributes more than Japan and the United States put together. The European Union and individual member states contribute approximately €25 billion. Ireland contributes approximately 35% of 1% of GDP. The highest figure is contributed by one of Nordic countries. Sweden contributes 0.8% of 1%.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">We watch situations evolve in the Middle East and Africa and we are there with our aid workers and money. However, at the end of the day, we have no political clout. The United States of America is looked at to solve all the problems. I am not against the United States. People with long enough memories will know I voted for the deployment of cruise and Pershing missiles in Europe, which was not very popular at the time. I was pro the United States and always favoured Europe having a strong alliance and strong partnership with it. That does not mean the United States should tell us whether we should admit Turkey to the European Union. This is our democracy. It is our responsibility and we should  not be pressurised by any other power on how to arrange the evolution of the Community.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Having said that, perhaps we could see our way to conceding what we might consider the national privilege of each individual state spending its own money on development co-operation and pool that resource. We could enlarge the contribution. The United Nations recommends a budget of 1.6% or 1.7% of GDP, that is, €60 billion to €70 billion. This is more than the entire sum spent on development co-operation in the world today. Perhaps the money could be spent within the framework of a common foreign policy. I will not push people if they do not wish to opt for common defence, although I see nothing wrong with common defence. Europe with one army will be a much safer place than the Europe of 15, 20 or 100 armies of the past. If people are not happy with this, let us have a common foreign policy which is tied into a good foreign development policy. It would not hurt the people of Europe to increase the contribution by 0.2% of 1% of GDP amounting to €60 billion or €70 billion. It would go a long way to stabilise the world and a long way in places such as the Middle East to rebuild it when peace eventually comes following the disaster created there, and for Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I am not without hope. I said at the beginning that I hoped we could evolve from a democratic European Union to a democracy for mankind. We had a referendum on the Nice treaty some time ago and argued about shadow issues and the giving up of sovereignty. On the same day we voted, without a word, for the setting up of an international court which, most certainly, was a far bigger concession of national sovereignty than anything we gave up in the Nice treaty and which the United States could not swallow. We should understand that in the context of sovereignty our interests are so intermeshed that we can only make our decisions together and in co-operation with each other. If one approaches it with a positive mind, it is amazing how everybody contributes within the European Union, be it the Prime Ministers of Luxembourg or of Ireland, an MEP from Ireland who, perhaps, never went to school or a coal miner from Denmark. Ireland may not be as big and powerful as Germany but every individual Irish citizen of the European Union is as important as any other citizen in the European Union. That is what real equality is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">We should seek to give Europe the competences needed to organise a better world which for me is most certainly a common defence foreign policy and good development co-operation. This has everything to do with foreign trade and fisheries, which are in a perilous state. There is no need for excessive interference and sometimes, for example, with the wildlife directive, I wonder whether we needed to go that far. In economic terms there are some issues where we should decide what competences attach to each level and thereby not turn off people. That said, I have seen Ministers come home and express horror at the details of some EU regulation for  which they voted without reading it. Often there is a tendency to blame Europe for the unhappy details which sometimes turn up in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">I always defend the European Union because we cannot guarantee its existence. For some reason or another, there are those who will propose and advocate its abolition. If they do not say it that way they will find some other way to say it, such as those who want to take in Turkey immediately. They have another agenda. They want to create some type of loose trading arrangement at European Union level. We cannot guarantee the European Union forever. It is still fragile. Blood was spilt in its creation. What is a nation state? There is no such thing as a nation state. In any event, the borders and limitations of the states of Europe were drawn out by the sword and minorities were suppressed and exterminated in many cases. The European Union gave the first rights to minority languages and religious liberties. It is the second guarantor we have here as well as in Germany and elsewhere of a higher standard of government that will guarantee the individual's safety from old prejudices of the past. I am not without hope that we can extend that.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">A few years ago a person asked if I would write a short statement – everybody was being asked to do it – for a park in Europe which was to be called mini Europe. The Irish journalists had come together to decide on the statement. I said I was working for a Europe whose people are united, whose economies are integrated and a Europe that will be prepared to share its good fortune and its spirit of freedom with less fortunate people throughout the world.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_176">Senator Higgins will commence questions. It is a wonderful privilege to see Mr. Joe McCartin, MEP, in the House. I found his address inspiring. I thank him for his contribution to the House and encourage people to read the transcript of today's debate to see what he had to say. Joe McCartin is a committed European and he has always taken unpopular stances, sometimes against his own constituents and the people of this country, because he believes in the European ideal. That is a great accolade to give someone. After 25 years service as a member of the European Parliament, one of its longest serving members, it is great to see him in the House today and still with such fire in his belly.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">I am thinking about what Mr. McCartin said. It was fresh air to come in and listen to him. Given that he is retiring it is great we had the opportunity to listen to him here before that day comes because of his knowledge, experience and depth of understanding of how we can reach out to Ireland. I am delighted we have given him the right of audience to come before the House and tell not only us but everyone of the importance of Europe. He has done that beautifully this morning.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_135">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_178">I join with the Cathaoirleach, Senator Brian Hayes and Senator Ormonde in welcoming Mr. Joe McCartin, MEP, to the House. I have followed the flight path of his career since his election to the European Assembly in 1979. I have never known anybody who has had such a comprehensive grasp of the complexities of Europe. The marvellous exposé he gave in the space of 20 minutes, in which he covered so many areas and raised so many issues, showed what was fundamental to his political make-up. That vision and idealism was again portrayed. We thank him for the 25 years of excellent service he has given Connacht-Ulster and Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I wish to ask a few brief questions. One of the problems that people here recognise is the perceived distance and failure to connect on the part of the public with Europe. Does Mr. McCartin see the new European convention bringing about a process of integration, understanding or connection? Regarding Objective One status, on which Mr. McCartin lobbied strongly and organised deputations to the then Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies to have the border, midlands and western region categorised within it for funding, the Indecon report of the half way review of the national development plan appears to indicate Ireland is still not getting the largesse to which it is entitled. I strongly believe Turkey should be a member provided it meets the human rights criteria and that its economy is in order. Does Mr. McCartin favour such an approach? He mentioned the urgent need for a common foreign policy. Does he see the creation of a new European foreign minister, which is part and parcel of the new Convention, as being successful and will it bring the urgently needed process of a common European foreign policy a step closer or make it a reality?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_180">I thank Mr. McCartin for his eloquent and thoughtful address. I was concerned that he said the EU was still a fragile institution. This shows how important it is that we support it. He said also that the EU had guaranteed minority rights. For women here, while we were in a majority, it guaranteed rights for us such as equal pay. The stability of the European Union is important. I was interested to hear him stress the importance of subsidiarity. We are frequently inclined to blame things we do not like on Europe without remembering we have subsidiarity in the enormous number of ways we interpret EU directives. I am glad Mr. McCartin mentioned this.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I was very glad to see the changes being made to the Common Agricultural Policy, and our Minister was absolutely right in promoting decoupling immediately. It must be of great concern to all Agriculture Ministers that changes have not yet been made in the United States despite the fact that Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowan farmer who is Chairman of the Committee on Finance in the US Senate, has tried to have some changes made in the way financial support is given to US farmers. It is awfully difficult for  farmers within the European Union to compete with the subsidies given out in the United States. Is there any way the European Union can support Senator Grassley's efforts? We seem to have terribly little influence on what happens in the United States. A very good example is the way in which the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr. Tony Blair, felt he had considerable influence on the President of the United States, yet when the President visited the United Kingdom last week, not one thing seemed to change, including the steel tariffs. Does the US Administration regard us as very junior partners or have we, as a bloc, much influence on what happens in the United States? Some of the actions of the United States are totally against the World Trade Organisation rules.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">I welcome Mr. McCartin to the House, thank him for his very informative and positive contribution on Europe and wish him well. Senator Higgins raised the issue of the distance that exists between the public and the EU institutions. One issue that arose in the Seanad during our examination of Seanad reform is whether we could play a bigger role in monitoring European affairs. Today's debate is part of this process. Does Mr. McCartin have any thoughts on how our national Parliament could link up better with the European Union and the Irish MEPs. Should we adopt any structures in that regard?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMauriceHayes" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_183">I, too, welcome Mr. McCartin to the House. It was a pleasure to hear his inspiring contribution. The quality of representation we have in Europe encourages me greatly. Furthermore, I was hugely impressed by his enthusiasm and passion for Europe given that it is so many years since he was first elected.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">It is not so much the mastery of the nuts and bolts of Europe that I want to talk about – I have no doubt that Mr. McCartin has done the post-doctoral course on that – but the appreciation of the historic entity that is Europe and its moral and rational basis. It is now unthinkable that Germany and France would engage in a war such as those that resulted in the death of millions in the last century. It is now unthinkable that the countries of eastern Europe would engage with the countries in western Europe other than in dialogue. One hopes this spirit and philosophy can be extended to the Balkans and further afield.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">I share Mr. McCartin's suspicion of the nation state, which has been an agency for great evil in the world over 150 years. As economic entities are getting bigger there is a necessity for political entities to get smaller. I support Mr. McCartin's view on subsidiarity. I believe subsidiarity means devolution not to national capitals but beyond those into the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I was lucky enough to be taught by a man whose ideal polity was the Holy Roman Empire and for whom the sun rose on Christmas Day in 800 when Charlemagne was crowned in Cologne  Cathedral. The empire actually crashed to pieces at Ravenna seven centuries later. This poses the question of what is Europe. De Gaulle had a view of a Europe extending from the Atlantic to the Urals. I do not think it included us at the time but, nevertheless, we will be charitable to him. Where will the borders of Europe be? Presumably, one cannot adopt new countries indefinitely but there must be some degree of permeability. I am interested in hearing Mr. McCartin's views on what will happen in respect of the Mediterranean and north Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Senator Tuffy asked how the citizens of Europe could be engaged in the affairs of Europe. What are Mr. McCartin's views on this? Given the enormous field that will have to be covered because of the slight reduction in the number of Irish MEPs, how will this be managed? I thank Mr. McCartin for his contribution, which I found very encouraging and inspiring.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_188">I, too, thank Mr. McCartin for attending. He was one of the first to respond when we issued the letters of invitation when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges agreed as a policy that MEPs be invited to address the House. Our Standing Orders already make provision in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">Mr. McCartin's address was amazingly full of vision. The passage of 25 years has not dimmed the reason he put himself forward as a candidate in the European elections and went to Europe. It is most inspiring to find somebody who has served for 25 years in a democratic milieu who has retained a sense of enjoyment regarding Europe, particularly a sense of purpose and vision. We are all the better for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">This exercise has been very good because we are beginning to see the calibre, strength of character and purpose of those who represent us in Europe. This is good because they were all a mystery to us beforehand. Mr. McCartin stated in his contribution that he viewed each institution, such as the county councils, the regional councils, the Dáil or Seanad, and European institutions, as separate entities representing democracy and that he was never one to trumpet the rights of MEPs to appear in a parliament. However, we would like to trumpet it because we feel this House can form an appropriate forum in which to hear the views of our MEPs. Mr. Pat Cox and others have already addressed the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">A clear pattern is emerging regarding the idealism people feel in terms of the job they took up. I often wondered how MEPs put up with the incessant travel and the early morning flights from Dublin or Knock Airports to Brussels. A Member of the House in the Fine Gael ranks will be or hopes to be emulating Mr. McCartin in this regard after the next election. Given that tiredness and the sense of being away from one's country, friends and family are part of being an MEP, I realise that a sense of vision is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Mr. McCartin struck a chord and was correct when he said Europe is the finest example of  human co-operation. It was set up in order that there would never again be conflicts such as the First and Second World Wars. Channel Four has a very good Saturday evening programme on the First World War and the scale of the slaughter and bloodshed during that and the Second World War when the armies were far more technically advanced. The European Union was founded on idealism, hope and aspiration, threads which have kept the countries of Europe together. Now, with the growth of the Union, where will it end? Mr. McCartin will deal with that in his reply to Senator Maurice Hayes's question on the same point. How can we manage a larger Union? We long for the new members to join, having supported enlargement because we were the beneficiaries for so long and wanted to give other countries, particularly those which had come out of serfdom and communist control, the chance we had and to see them glow brightly. Many are descended from ancient civilisations and would have had culture and education long before other countries. We welcome them and look forward to the opportunity to meet them during our Presidency. How will the Union manage itself in a larger environment?</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Mr. McCartin was a keen member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture during his time in this Parliament. He spoke about how the "CAP fitted" Ireland even though there was a certain inequality within it. He also mentioned the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the vision of rural regeneration which is now agricultural policy. Will Mr. McCartin tell us on what committees he served in the European Parliament and the headline policies which emanated from them?</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I thank Mr. McCartin for coming to the House. This is a very good exercise for the Oireachtas and before Christmas we will meet as many MEPs as are keen to talk to us. Many are coming and we hope to repeat the exercise next term. Mr. McCartin is not a member of my party, but that is not the point. On behalf of the people of the west, Connacht-Ulster and the country at large, I thank Mr. McCartin for his commitment to, and relish for, his purpose. He has given freely of himself to the EU on our behalf.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_195">I too welcome Mr. McCartin and thank him for his most informative and interesting presentation. He spoke about a united Ireland and co-operation within Europe, but serious problems remain here with regard to getting people interested in the affairs of Europe. We are the greatest beneficiaries of the European Union but still people do not seem to be interested in what happens on mainland Europe. Is this because Ireland is an island nation or are there other reasons?</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Much of it is our own fault. There are situations in which national politicians and the Government blame the European Union for various laws and regulations and for the red tape and bureaucracy.  This is very evident in the Department of Agriculture and Food, which tells people that it cannot pay a grant because of a detail in their applications and the guidelines are set in Brussels. People are frustrated by the bureaucracy at the centre of democracy in the European Union. Yesterday we heard a note of arrogance creeping in from the larger nations in the EU, when Italy did a deal for France and Germany with regard to managing their economies under the Stability and Growth Pact while the smaller nations co-operated and took the business of the European Union and the guidelines set by the Commission very seriously. Mr. McCartin said at the end of his presentation that there is a fragility in Europe and I see that in the dominance by the larger nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">We have much in common with the applicant nations in terms of heritage and culture. I have visited many of those countries, including Slovakia and Slovenia, where the people are very nice and sincere. Will the EU development projects move towards those nations and will we become further isolated within the enlarged Union? If the local elections did not coincide with the European elections, the turnout would be less than 40% in European elections and this would send the wrong message to our colleague nations in the EU. We are propping up the turnout at the European elections by calling the local elections at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">The television channel, CCN, reports on the news in each state in the United States. We should promote a European channel on all the networks throughout the Union to enlighten and inform people about what is happening in the European Parliament and in the various member states. We should work towards this as it would give us a greater insight into their cultures and so on. Again, I sincerely thank Mr. McCartin for coming here. He has always been a common sense politician. I admire him and his great grasp of European affairs.</p>

Having watched and taken an interest in the affairs of the European Parliament for over 20 years, I admire Mr. McCartin's independent mind, within the framework of his party. Regardless of whether one agrees with him, no one could doubt his political courage. We are not elected to this or any other House or parliament to be political clones. Each of us has a contribution to make and Mr. McCartin has made a very clear contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">My view of the nation state is somewhat more benign than his view. The independence of this country is, in a sense, based on the concept of the nation state, but that was a reaction to empires and the European Union is a sort of synthesis of the better elements of both.</p>

          <p eId="para_203">Although the final decisions on the European constitution have not been taken, the parameters are reasonably clear. Does Mr. McCartin believe it likely, unless something very unexpected happens, that there is anything in the outcomes expected within the next month or two that would make it necessary for us to oppose adoption of the constitution? Would he take the view that as things are progressing we should continue to support our participation and full membership?</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Yesterday's decision by the Finance Ministers should not be seen entirely as an issue of large powers versus small powers and whether they are treated equally. Perhaps one of the reasons the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, took the position he did also involves the question of how much central control the EU should have over budgetary policy. On that issue we might be more on the side of France and Germany than appears in public discussion. Mr. McCartin might comment on this aspect.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">My colleagues and I welcome Mr. McCartin back to the House. He has been an MEP of extraordinary energy and as a constituent of his in Connacht-Ulster, I express on my own behalf and that of his constituents great thanks to him for the enthusiasm with which he always upheld the European concept. Throughout the years when we rarely glimpsed an MEP, one could be assured that Mr. McCartin would turn up at various meetings whether political or public and would defend to the limit the concept of Europe. Although there may be downsides to defending it and although many changes brought about by EU directives and regulations, or by decisions taken in Europe, may not initially have been acceptable in this State, he nevertheless felt compelled to defend Europe and did so with great determination and honesty, which we welcomed at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Mr. McCartin was one of the few people who some years ago took on board and piloted the concept of Objective One status for the BMW region. He lobbied extensively in his own constituency and at national level as well as in Europe. The outcome was of tremendous benefit to all concerned, including Governments over the years, in improving the lot of the western areas. We can see that continuing in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">It is my belief, expressed in both Houses of the Oireachtas in the past, that there is an over-zealous attempt to implement all the EU directives and regulations that have come in over the years. There is a lack of equality in the way they are interpreted in the various countries, by various Government Departments and by the civil servants in those Departments who have tunnel vision in terms of how things must be done, with very serious consequences. In no place has there been such crude and severe implementation as in the special areas of conservation directive for  whose imposition we principally blame Dúchas, perhaps incorrectly because Dúchas is blamed for many things. Its implementation under legislation introduced by Ministers and Governments over the years seems cruel. I remember Mr. McCartin being a member of the European affairs committee when a senior executive came before it and said that these directives were never intended to deny people in any way the opportunity of making a reasonable and honest living within their environment. Tragically, the application of some of these directives, or aspects of them, has been over-zealous in Ireland and has curtailed the capacity of people to continue to make a decent living in areas with very few natural resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Will Mr. McCartin comment on the over-production we heard about four or five years ago regarding the butter mountains, wine lakes and so on? Have they disappeared, or is it merely that criticising them has gone out of fashion? Changes coming in from Europe will mean changes for the whole pattern of agriculture and rural living in Ireland. Is it not amazing that we can see some of the best land in this country left idle, growing weeds or nothing at all? Something is wrong somewhere. Perhaps Europe has been very good for us, but there is something wrong when we leave dormant our best productive land. I ask Mr. McCartin to comment because he has vast experience in agriculture.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">I welcome Mr. McCartin, whose constituency borders the Leas-Chathaoirleach's area of the Shannon and midlands. I know from my dealings with many people down through the years of Mr. McCartin's term as an MEP that when he spoke on agricultural matters, people listened and took great heed of what he had to say because he always dealt with what was relevant to the people who mattered on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">I was heartened to hear Mr. McCartin's comments on rural development. As a man of great experience, he put down a marker in this area. We have concentrated greatly on urban development in Ireland, but Mr. McCartin noted an opportunity for agriculture and the farming community, for farmers to continue on the land long after our time as public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I support the comments of Senator Jim Higgins on the BMW region and Objective One status. Qualification was purely as a result of disadvantage in the area, of which my constituency of Laoighis-Offaly is part. It is crucial that the area retains Objective One status. Mr. McCartin may have some influence in that regard. There is one slight problem in that part of the area is not regarded as fully disadvantaged. There is an anomaly there and farmers are losing out. I will comment later on the wildlife directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Mr. McCartin expressed views on the Committee of the Regions, which could be a very valuable body if it was used more to look at legislation and help our MEPs. The number of MEPs in this country will fall. The members of the Committee of the Regions are members of local auth orities who have their fingers on the pulse in dealing with all local authority matters. Their positions should be made full-time, with a specific remit of ensuring that legislation is properly vetted by the country they represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I thank Mr. McCartin sincerely. Although I am from a different political party, I have always admired what he had to say on Europe and agriculture. Mr. McCartin is not standing for re-election as an MEP and it is a huge blow to this country to lose someone of his experience and ability in Europe.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">I welcome Mr. McCartin to the House and I thank him for his most comprehensive, informative and interesting address. As many Members have remarked, it was truly inspirational.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I have three questions. Mr. McCartin touched on the enthusiasm for Europe in some areas which we may have thought somewhat misguided, such as the habitat directives. A certain section of Europe has had too much regard for such protection. I am not saying such habitats should be wiped out by chemicals or pesticides, but there is over-emphasis on insects, snails and plant life. Ridiculous situations arise where areas adjacent to national and secondary routes are designated as SACs. Those roads need to be widened in the interests of safety, the paramount concern. The plant and insect life will survive in adjoining areas that are more worthy of preservation. This has been too extensive, intrusive and damaging to the people. The correct balance was not struck. As Senator Burke said, Dúchas took this up with too much enthusiasm and went overboard. I welcomed the Government decision on Dúchas, but it should go further and put the entire service under the remit of the Office of Public Works. It is misplaced in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">There is a frightful hullabaloo about stem cell research. What is Mr. McCartin's view of that issue? It is an important matter to many people in this country because of our interpretation of the constitutional position.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCartin, MEP</from>
          <p eId="para_222">I quoted the late William Butler Yeats, a former Member of this House, in Sligo. In the poem "Youth and Age" he said:</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Much did I rage when young,</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Being by the world oppressed,</p>
          <p eId="para_225">But now with flattering tongue</p>
          <p eId="para_226">It speeds the parting guest.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I am not becoming cynical, far from it, but Yeats was no fool.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Another philosopher came to mind when we were talking of people's interest in the European Union and politics generally. Lao Tzu, a Chinese philosopher who predated Christ by 400 years and was earlier than Confucius, said when disorder comes to the land, patriotism is born. The opposite is also true; when the land is in good order, people become complacent. When I first went to the European Parliament, I met many people who had been in the war, whose parents had disappeared and whose homes and property had all been lost. I met Germans who carried a heavy burden of guilt over what had happened to the Jewish communities in eastern Europe. Today we have moved further away from that and young people do not talk about it as much. Europe is not very fragile but it might be more delicate than we think because the passion for unity and structures to ensure peace might not exist to the same extent today. Young people may have forgotten the basic reason behind the creation of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Senator Maurice Hayes mentioned the emperor Charlemagne. When we debated Europe in the early days, I asked why we were afraid of Europe when we had sent saints and scholars throughout Europe who assisted with its development as a continent. Charlemagne loved the Irish monks. A French person told me that Charlemagne valued <i>les moines errants</i>, the wandering monks, and encouraged them to come to his empire. The composer Robert Schumann proposed that Saint Columbanus should be the patron saint of Europe because he was the first man who viewed it in its entirety.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">We survived in the United States and secured our identity not by waving the crom béal or dancing jigs and reels, but by becoming part of America. Our strongest asset in the European Union is our ability to go there with the self-confidence that brought St. Columbanus to northern Italy, where he founded cities, and that brought 500,000 Irish Wild Geese to fight for causes other than their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">We should not be nervous about Europe – it is part of what we are. I am not one of those who recognises separate nations; it is a long time since such entities existed. Marianne Elliot, in her  book, <i>The Catholics of Ulster,</i> said that when St. Patrick came to Ulster, the Ulsterman was already a mongrel and that when the Normans arrived, there was only one clan that could be identified as pre-Gaelic. I have looked at the past of Europe and what we have created is much better.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">When I mentioned Turkey, it was not out of concern that it is a threat or danger to Europe but there are those who readily say that we should take in Turkey in the sure knowledge that it might make the institutions so unwieldy that our democratic structures could not handle a Union so changed by such a large and difficult economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Senator Maurice Hayes asked where the limits lie. I am not anxious to place geographic limits on Europe. I do not know who designed its borders, but Cicero said that the Romans lived around the Mediterranean like frogs around a pool so Europe would include north Africa. My vision is of a democracy for mankind, but we should not try to raise that idea too fast. We must be patient and enlarge only as we can handle it. We must not be pushed by outside forces or agendas into creating a Europe that is ungovernable and with which we are not happy.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">There were many other questions, on agriculture and other things. We must recognise that agriculture is about the production of food. The new agenda will confine the production of food within those limits of environmental damage, animal welfare, of course, and the welfare of the human labour employed. However, the borders between what we call organic agriculture and viable, competitive agriculture are becoming dimmed. The bottom line will be that the food we produce must be safe. It must be produced in such a way that it is traceable so we know where it comes from, allowing us to establish what it is. We must not damage the environment, which is the position we should approach it from. Holland, with 1% of Europe's land, produces 7% of Europe's food. If France was as intensively cultivated as Holland we would need no more land to produce enough food. There is more land in Europe than we need for the production of food. At one time I was lecturing former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, about Irish land. I wanted a programme of afforestation, or whatever it was at the time. He told me the sums at that time did not justify the investment. He said that just because the land was there did not mean we had to make any particular use of it. The land is there for the good of mankind. It is not necessary to have rye, wheat or vegetables growing in every field; we can leave it for human enjoyment. The Common Agricultural Policy will ensure we get good food at the right price and that the environment will be safe and enjoyable for humanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Of the European Union's budget, 40% goes on agriculture, 30% on Structural Funds, about 7% on internal policies, research and so on. The big danger is that we will have a Europe that makes  laws and all we will see coming from the European institutions are directives. They are over there telling us what we may or may not do, which is fine – that has to be done – but national governments will appear with the goodies and it will appear that Europe has no goodies. John Healy of <i>The Irish Times</i> said we were destined when we went to the European Parliament to live a remote and lonely existence because there was no pork barrel in Europe out of which awards could be made for the political effort that sent us there. We will have to be very careful about the people of Europe perceiving the European institutions as a factory for the turning out of directives. The €6 billion or €7 billion that was divided in the early days for actions in favour of women, the handicapped and the poor of the inner cities, may not be important in an economic sense, but we must reserve some place in the European budget for those actions which will help to connect Europe with its ordinary citizens as well as explaining its necessity to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I said I did not believe in MEPs coming to Parliament to talk to Members, but it is important that we are available to explain issues and if Members want to talk to us. I had a dual mandate for a long time and I do not remember, when speaking on agriculture, having any particular audience in the Dáil any more than if I was not a Member of the European Parliament. The special expertise of MEPs, while they were still Members of the Dáil, was not recognised in any way. I do not remember the political establishment in Ireland consulting me about particular things. Everybody is too busy with their own patch. We should remember what Chancellor Kohl said, namely that henceforth we will live our lives according to three reference points – our home, our homeland and the European Union. Those three reference points will have to be attended to in our political objectives and planning in the future as we cannot afford to neglect our home, our homeland or Europe.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_238">I am delighted to have this opportunity to debate the 2004 pre-budget Estimates in Seanad Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The 2004 pre-budget Estimates provide for a total expenditure on public services of €40.4 billion in 2004, which is an increase of €1.9 billion or a 5% increase on the forecasted outturn for 2003. The gross allocation for current spending is  just under €35 billion or a 6% increase on the forecasted outturn for 2003. The gross Exchequer provision for capital investment is €5.5 billion, which is two and three quarter times the level of capital expenditure in 1997. The overall level of investment provided for 2004 represents a substantial allocation of resources in providing for day to day public services and for development of the economy into the future. The Estimates have been formulated with a view to consolidating the substantial economic and social progress which the Government has achieved since 1997 and to ensuring that the economy is well placed to take advantage of the expected upturn in the international economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Despite the international economic downturn in recent years, Ireland's growth rate is still well above the EU average. The EU Commission projects GDP growth for Ireland of 3.7% in 2004 compared to growth in the EU 15 of 2%. Our unemployment rate at 4.4%, which is down from 10.3% in 1997, is currently half the EU average and our general Government debt level at an estimated 34% of GDP is the second lowest in the EU. It is important that we do not allow these achievements to be dissipated by imprudent management of the economy now.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">As the Minister for Finance indicated in his contribution to the debate in the other House on the Estimates, there are a number of factors which must be taken into account in assessing our economic prospects as a small open economy and in framing our spending policy. As a result of a slower than anticipated global recovery in the second half of 2003, the official economic projections for Ireland's GDP growth in 2003 were revised downwards from 3.5% to 1.5% in August. Ireland is part of a monetary union where monetary policy is focused on ensuring a low inflation environment, with the ECB aiming to maintain the rate of inflation at close to 2% over the medium term. International competition is exerting downward pressure on goods prices and is likely to continue to do so for some time to come. International competition for jobs and investment is also becoming more intense.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_155" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_243">It is on its way. I apologise for the delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Government is playing its part in keeping costs down by continuing the process begun in 2002 of bringing public expenditure under tighter control to reflect economic realities. We can no longer sustain the levels of spending which the exceptional economic growth between 1997 and 2000 allowed. As economic growth has moderated, the Government has followed a course of bringing spending increases more in line with increases in revenue. The gap between revenue and public spending growth has been reduced by keeping a tight rein on spending over the past 18 months. All Ministers have played their part by  actively managing their budgets and by implementing effectively the measures relating to financial management and control which were announced in last year's Estimates debate. Particularly important is the monthly reporting to Government on expenditure trends and the requirements placed on Departments in relation to risk assessment and contingency planning to cater for unforeseen pressures.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">If we fail to manage the public finances sensibly, we run the risk of either an early return to higher levels of taxation or excessive levels of borrowing. This could undermine the significant progress made since 1997 in generating economic growth, increasing employment levels and tackling poverty. The 2004 Estimates are designed to consolidate this progress and to lay solid foundations for ensuring that the economy is well positioned to benefit from the upturn in the international economy which now seems to be developing.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">As a result of the policy of keeping tighter control of public expenditure, the rate of increase in gross spending this year is expected to moderate for the third year in a row. In 2003 gross spending is expected to increase by 7.6% over 2002. The corresponding annual increases for the previous two years were 14.4% and 20.7%, respectively. However, the outturn on gross spending is estimated to be higher than provided in the Revised Estimates by €340 million. The additional gross spending is offset by additional receipts from the health levy, moneys recouped from the United Kingdom for health services and higher PRSI income into the Social Insurance Fund, giving a forecasted net excess of €115 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The Government has continued in the 2004 Estimates with its policy of giving priority to the areas of social welfare, health, education and infrastructure. Health, education and social welfare spending will account for 67% of the total gross allocation of more than €40 billion next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Before dealing in more detail with the sectoral allocations I want to dispel the notion that the Government is seeking to introduce stealth taxes and promote increased charges in order to fund the proposed increases in public spending. The total value of additional charges foreseen as a result of the 2004 Estimates, including motor tax increases, is estimated at some €91 million. This represents less than 0.3% of the total gross provision of more than €40 billion in public spending provided for in the Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The provision for health spending is more than €10 billion, an increase of €739 million, or 8%, over the forecast outturn for 2003. Cumulative spending on health from 1997 to 2004 has been €53,000 million and the share of total national public expenditure on health has increased from 19.2% in 1997 to 24.9% in 2004. This investment has resulted in real improvements in the delivery of front-line health services.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_157" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_251">There are now about 96,000 staff employed in providing health services, compared to 66,000 in 1997. During this time an additional 6,000 nurses have been recruited, which amounts to 22% of the total increase. A further 8,500 people – over 30% of the increase – have been recruited to the medical, dental or health and social care professional grades. These employees are providing an increased level of front-line health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The gross allocation for education and science is €6.5 billion, an increase of €674 million, or 11%, on the forecast outturn for 2003. The cumulative increase in gross expenditure on education over the period 1997 to 2004 will amount to €3.3 billion, a doubling of expenditure over the period. This has funded significant improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio. At primary level the ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 18:1 in the 2002-03 school year, while at second level the ratio has fallen from 16:1 to 13.6:1 in the same period. As in the case of the health sector, the 2004 Estimates will continue to support the employment of significant numbers of front-line staff. There will be nearly 79,000 employees in the delivery of educational services, including approximately 2,500 resource teachers and 1,530 learning support teachers in the primary system and more than 5,500 special needs assistants employed in first and second level schools to ensure that children with special educational needs in mainstream classes receive the educational supports necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Before allowing for any budget day social welfare rate increases, the allocation for social welfare, at €10.6 billion, is the single biggest expenditure provision in the Estimates. On that basis, spending in 2004 on social welfare will have almost doubled since 1997, notwithstanding that unemployment has fallen from 10.3% to 4.4%. There has therefore been a very significant increase in real terms in the level of social welfare provision since 1997 and real increases in benefits for social welfare recipients. There will be changes in eligibility conditions for some social welfare payments in 2004 arising from ongoing reviews of relevant schemes to ensure they continue to meet their objectives. However, the economies arising will amount to an estimated €56 million, which represents just over 0.5% of the total gross pre-budget provision of €10.6 billion for social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Before turning to capital expenditure I want to address the issue of public service pay and numbers. The Government is committed to honouring its pay commitments in Sustaining Progress, provided the conditions in the agreement are met. The conclusions of the performance verification groups which have been established to monitor progress in implementing change will be examined in this regard. If groups or sectors breach the terms of Sustaining Progress, payments will not be made in those areas. The 2004 Estimates  therefore provide for Exchequer-funded public service pay and pensions of €14.2 billion, an increase of €1.1 billion, or 8%, on 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">A number of considerations are worth noting. First, this rate of increase is lower than that of any of the last four years. In 2003 a six-month pay pause for the public service was secured, which meant that all the increases due under Sustaining Progress are to be paid in 2004. The pay pause in 2003 saved the Exchequer about €180 million this year. The 2004 increase does not just cover benchmarking but comprises the general round increases under Sustaining Progress, costing €540 million, and the 2004 increases arising from benchmarking, costing €305 million. A total of €265 million of the additional pay cost is due to other factors such as the payment of the increase due to the application of the part-time work legislation in education, an increased provision for the EU Presidency, increments, an extra pay day in 2004 for some staff and an increase in the number of pensioners. Benchmarking accounts for just over a quarter of the expected increase in the pay bill. If we wish to provide quality public services which benefit all sectors of society, we must continue to pay public servants at rates which are reasonably comparable to those in the private sector. Otherwise we will not be able to attract and retain good quality public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The best way of managing public service pay costs is through a combination of partnership and negotiation of increases in line with our ability to pay, seeking improvements in the quality of service provision and controlling public service numbers. Staff numbers in the public service increased by 59,000, or 27%, between 1997 and 2002. These increases are unsustainable in the context of the moderation in economic growth which we have experienced and the slower growth in tax revenues. Accordingly, the Minister for Finance announced in last year's budget a cap on numbers employed in the public service and a reduction of 5,000 in the overall numbers employed. The Government subsequently agreed the timing and details of the reductions and has sought to minimise the impact on front-line staff in implementing them. A reduction of 2,000 is expected by the end of next year while the full impact of the reduction in numbers will be seen in 2005 and 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The gross allocation for Exchequer capital expenditure will be €5.5 billion in 2004, which is some 2.75 times the 1997 expenditure of €2 billion. Within this overall allocation for 2004, capital investment in the transport area on roads and public transport will be €1.6 billion, an increase of €1.3 billion, or 413%, over 1997. The Exchequer provision for capital investment in housing will be more than €1 billion, an increase of €766 million, or 275%, over 1997. This provision will be supplemented by more than €650 million of non-voted capital investment by the local authorities. Health capital investment in 2004 will be €509 million, an increase of €342 million, or 205%, over 1997. Capital investment  in education will be €491 million, an increase of €327 million, or 199%, since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Addressing the country's infrastructural deficit is a key priority of the national development plan. Since 1997, particularly in the early years of the plan, the Government has deliberately increased and maintained annual Exchequer capital investment at historically high levels. Compared to an expenditure of 3.4% of GNP in 1997, capital expenditure has been maintained at around 5% of GNP in the past few years. This is twice the EU average. When public private partnership investment in public projects and the contribution of CIE resources to public transport investment are taken into account, total capital spending on this basis will be about €5.9 billion, an increase of more than €350 million, or 6%, on 2003. Subject to an overall sustainable budgetary environment, the Government is committed to maintaining public capital investment at similarly high levels in the medium term. This will mean more modest nominal levels of year-on-year increases than in the early years of the NDP. The Government is satisfied that this approach will yield sustained output at good value. Regrettably, as the ESRI confirmed in its recent evaluation, the large annual nominal increases in the early years of the NDP were considerably diluted by runaway construction industry inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">As regards value-for-money concerns arising from cost overruns and deficient management of infrastructure projects, the Department of Finance's capital appraisal guidelines for public sector capital projects are currently in the process of being revised. The Minister for Finance has also indicated in the Lower House that he is in favour, in principle, of a multi-annual system of financial envelopes for capital investment. This was recommended by the ESRI and would facilitate more efficient project and programme management by giving greater certainty about the availability of resources over a number of years. The Minister has stated that he intends to return to these issues on budget day.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The strategy underpinning the 2004 Estimates is the right one in the current economic circumstances and in the context of providing for future growth and development. It will enable us to build on the significantly expanded expenditure base of recent years while sustaining a healthy economy and public finances so that we can capitalise on the now expected international economic upturn. This policy of sound management of our economy and resources through times of unprecedented growth and in less favourable international circumstances means the Government, without recourse to excessive taxation or borrowing, can provide for public expenditure of more than €40 billion next year and, within that overall allocation, give priority to investment in the areas of health, education, social welfare and infrastructure.</p>

          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_261">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House. The chickens have  come home to roost and the double-digit public spending spree of 2001 has caught up with the Government. An election was just around the corner in 2001 when a reckless Government lashed out public money as if there was no tomorrow. As the Minister of State said, public spending increased by a whopping 20.1% over the already inordinately high 2000 figure. People were fooled and bought the bonanza.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">There was a tomorrow and it arrived with a vengeance with the publication of this Book of Estimates. An increase of more that 20% in 2001 has been reduced to only 5% in 2004. The Minister of State confirmed the galling reality that the bulk of this 5% increase will be gobbled up in non-productive wage increases for the public sector. This will account for approximately €1.1 billion of the overall €1.9 billion increase. It is a colossal amount. The already massive public pay bill is being pushed up by €540 million under the national programme. Benchmarking will cost €305 million and other pay increases to the public service will cost €265 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Fine Gael has taken a courageous but entirely correct position on the issue of benchmarking. We have said in clear and unequivocal terms that benchmarking should not be paid. We have stated that the cost is too high and with the sorry state of public finances, the whole exercise is too costly. Public servants have already been well looked after in the various partnership agreements, including the last one. We have rightly pointed out that in the absence of verifiable and tangible improvements in public services, the deal should be called off. A debate was held on this issue in the House during Private Members' business. In the debate, I called for the publication of the findings of the verification groups. We have not yet seen anything of the findings of any verification group, either in the shape of an interim or final report.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The reaction of the Government parties to the Fine Gael position on benchmarking has been particularly amusing. There were chuckles and taunts that Fine Gael had shot itself in the foot and by alienating 280,000 public servants, we were in effect committing political suicide. What the Government parties failed to realise was that for every person employed in the public service that will benefit – or think they will benefit – from benchmarking, there are five people employed in the private sector. Many of these people are working their fingers to the bone with no guaranteed income, let alone increases. These are the people who will contribute the bulk of the whopping benchmarking increases for those working in the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">What the Government assumed and hoped was a political own goal has become politically and economically popular. Realising this, the Government, particularly the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, has in recent days strained at the bit to emphasise the requirement that without public service improvements and increases in productivity, benchmarking will not be paid. It will  be extremely interesting to see how this extravagant saga plays out. I doubt and remain sceptical that many of the so-called commensurate increases and improvements in public service and productivity will be delivered in return for what is a whopping give away.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The Government may have bought power in a ruthless and reckless spending binge in the run up to the general election. As a result, the Minister of State and his senior colleague will be comfortably ensconced in their offices on Merrion Street for at least another few years.</p>

          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_271">In the Estimates, the Government has targeted cuts at some of the most vulnerable sectors of society. The Minister of State was not a Member of the Oireachtas when another famous slogan won a general election for Fianna Fáil. I can clearly remember the poster with Charles J. Haughey beckoning in the direction of the slogan, "health cuts hit the old, the sick and the handicapped". The Minister of State and his colleagues in Government have certainly hit the old, the sick and the handicapped. Hospital and accident and emergency charges have been increased by €5 to €45. This is an increase of 12.5% at a time when inflation is predicted to run at between 2% and 3%. Nightly in-patient bed charges similarly have been increased by 12.5% from €40 to €45. The drug refund threshold has been increased by 11.4% from €70 to €78. Imagine the impact this will have on the many low income families in this State. I think of people with asthma, diabetes, rheumatism or other medical problems who are a tantalisingly €1 over the rather modest threshold for qualifying for a medical card and now have this foisted upon them.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Motor tax has also been increased even for the most modest of cars. There will be an increase from €278 to €292 for a 1.4 litre car. In many cases we are talking about young people paying off a loan on a second-hand car to carry them to and from their first job. Young people are being ripped off by high annual premiums from highly profitable insurance companies. In some cases that annual premium is higher than the value of the car. Drivers are already paying high motor tax rates and will now have to pay an additional 6% increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I was a member of the Government that abolished third level fees. This imaginative measure was introduced by the then Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, and was broadly welcomed. For the first time, it gave some relief to  the many middle income PAYE taxpayers whose student children did not live within a commutable distance from third level institutions. At that time they were being screwed on all sides and were saddled with both huge fees and maintenance costs. We have witnessed the introduction of fees by the back door – it was the first of the ritual stealth taxes. A registration fee was imposed for each student entering third level colleges. A seemingly modest tax – that is what it was – when it was introduced was increased to €670 last year. For the coming college year, another €80 is to be lumped on, bringing it to €750. This is a registration fee and must be paid even before one thinks of maintenance or other costs. Fees have come back with a vengeance and so former Minister Niamh Bhreathnach's dream of a fair deal for the hard-pressed PAYE taxpayer trying to put two or three kids simultaneously through college has been set at nought.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Exam fees for the junior and leaving certificates are up from €72 to €82, a 14% increase. This from the party of the late Donogh O'Malley, the man who pioneered the concept of free education. Free education is a thing of the past. Inflation is running at 2% or 3% and yet ten-year passports have increased from €57 to €75 in one fell swoop, a 30% increase. Multiple entry visas have doubled, a 100% increase from €50 to €100. How can the Minister of State justify increasing something by 100% at a time when inflation is predicted – he probably boasts about this – at 2% to 3%? The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who should be here today, once served as Minister for Social Welfare. I recall sitting across from him in the Dáil when he announced the infamous "dirty dozen" cuts. Nobody thought that initiative could be superseded, but it has been. In this Book of Estimates, there is a cut of €458 million by way of so-called savings, amounting to 16 cuts across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Lone parents will lose up to €200 per week because of cuts in their rent allowance and the payment for one-parent families. Lone parents returning to work will no longer receive half of the one-parent family payment. That is a cut of at least €141 per week. Low income couples are also hit. The partner or spouse of someone in full-time employment will no longer be able to claim rent allowance. Those returning to education through the commendable back to education scheme will be hit by the increase from six to 15 months in the length of time one must spend on social welfare before receiving the weekly allowance of €124.80. That means the back to education scheme has basically been dismantled.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Health boards can refuse rent allowance to anyone not already renting for six months, unless he or she is homeless. This is guaranteed to make people homeless. Where are people supposed to get the rent for six months when they are in private rented accommodation and getting no subsidy whatsoever? This will throw more people on to the streets. The crèche supplement, covering the cost of emergency child care, has been  scrapped. The diet supplement for people with special dietary needs is to be phased out over a period of time. Entitlement to the half-rate of unemployment and disability benefit is to be scrapped where a claimant's spouse or partner has gross income in excess of €300. The earnings threshold for the payment of reduced rates of disability and unemployment benefit is to be increased from €88 to €150. Underlying insurance contributions will require an increase from 39 to 52 weeks for a person to qualify for disability or unemployment benefit and health and safety benefits. The maximum duration of unemployment benefit is to be reduced from 390 to 312 days where a person has less than 260 PRSI contributions. This is the most inhuman and regressive set of cuts ever announced by a Government and has occurred a mere few days before the Society of St. Vincent de Paul at its Christmas launch, at which the Taoiseach was asked to preside, indicated that there are 300,000 households in which children and families are living on less than €170 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">What we have here is a Government determined to perpetuate the two-tier society. Is it not incongruous, wrong, immoral and inhuman that in the week this is announced, the ongoing saga between the manager of Manchester United and Coolmore Stud over ownership of the Rock of Gibraltar racehorse is in the news? The horse will gain €10 million in stud fees without a single penny being paid in taxation. I am in favour of supporting the bloodstock industry, but I do not believe that taxing it would do any damage whatsoever. If the quality is good enough, then the bloodstock industry will continue to thrive.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Local authorities are to be saddled with a bill of €42 million by way of a shortfall to pay for the extravagant benchmarking awards. In County Mayo, if a young couple wants to build a house, it buys a site and applies for planning permission. However, before a sod is turned on the site, the couple will have to pay more than €10,000 by way of a so-called development levy.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">Extravagant figures are being agreed county by country and this is from a Government that abolished the first-time buyer's grant of £3,000 or €3,700 last year. I am looking at the figures, for example, on capital expenditure. That is where the money should be going, into capital expenditure, into transport, into infrastructure, into developing the nuts and bolts of the economy to attract investment and keep the wheels of industry moving. Capital expenditure is painfully inadequate in this set of Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I am at a loss to know why the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Finance, voted for the Stability and Growth Pact exemption for the two largest countries in the EU. Quite obviously there is some covert agenda. It is obvious the Minister for Finance sees that if they  can get an exemption, so can he. However, this is wrong because once one begins to breach the rules, the rule book goes out the window. The pact was a central cog as regards keeping the European economy on side.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The Minister of State came into this House on 3 May 2003 to debate decentralisation. We received all the grand assurances – decentralisation was going ahead and it was a great concept, involving 10,000 jobs etc. I have gone through the data. I do not see a single line by way of a provision for decentralisation. It is obvious that the Government sees this as a political hot potato. There are 10,000 jobs in prospect, but 134 towns have already made submissions and are vying for inclusion but, politically, this issue is a loser. It was supposed to be introduced in 2001 but the general election was imminent. It was supposed to come in this year but will not because two more elections are imminent. It is obvious that decentralisation has been deferred and will be long-fingered forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The Minister of State has clung to the old excuse and cited international factors. I listened on the radio yesterday to the current situation in the United States. The 11 September 2001 debacle carried us along for two or three years. Now international factors are to blame. However, the American economy, the main victim of 11 September, grew by 8% in the last quarter, the biggest increase in more than 65 years. We are paying the price of the squander-mania of 2001. It was a dear price, but hopefully the electorate will see it on D-day, which is not far away.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_284">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House. As he correctly pointed out in the first line of his speech, these are the pre-budget Estimates. Obviously they will be followed by post-budget Estimates and a revised Book of Estimates at a further stage. In some areas, this most obviously applies to social welfare. The full picture is not given, so judgment must be suspended to a degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I welcome the provisional Book of Estimates, which is designed to give us and sustain a strong economy. If one looks at the basics, we have a strong economy. We are two years into an international downturn and hopefully can see signs of an upturn. Unemployment at 4.5%, which was historic even in good times, is extraordinary in conditions of international downturn. We have a sound financial position, with debt remaining low. In short, we will be in a strong position going into any upturn and these factors will help to sustain this.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">We have had extraordinary increases in public expenditure since 1997. The Minister quoted some statistics for both current and capital spending. Would those resources have been available if we had followed any other economic policy? I do not believe there is any other way we could have achieved such extraordinary increases in public expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Senator Higgins spoke about pre-election splurges. I again draw his attention to the IMF and OECD studies of the Irish economy, which were referred to in a previous economic debate in April and August this year. They took the view that, coming into the downturn, the increase in public expenditure and in public service staffing was good. It helped achieve a soft landing for the economy. They equally took the view that we were correct to pull in the reins in 2003 and 2004. However it has been done and whatever the motive was, we have achieved a soft landing for the economy and can look forward to the future. I do not accept the criticisms of economic policy. The lag in adjustment from the end of the Celtic tiger economy, which was probably the second quarter of 2001, and pulling the reins tighter on public spending was economically beneficial.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">A great deal has been said about benchmarking. Members of the House have heard totally misleading figures to the effect that €1.1 billion was being spent on it. The attitude was that it would have been much more beneficial if that money had been spent on X, Y and Z. When he produced the Estimates the Minister pointed out that the cost is €305 million, which is 2% of the public service pay bill. Using words such as "huge", "horrendous" and so forth is frankly ridiculous. The year 2002 was the best year for industrial peace for over 30 years so there already has been some payback. Compared with the old system of relativities, benchmarking is clearly superior.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">It is obvious that the Government is making demands of public sector workers. Adjustments are being made in many areas of the public sector and people work hard. Caricatures are offered about the contrast between the private and public sectors. Many people in the public sector work hard and productively and they deserve to be remunerated properly. If one takes the last few years together, they are not being paid disproportionately to the private sector. They provide services to the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Senator Higgins is correct to point out that the stance of the Fine Gael Party is courageous. It is courageous in the "Yes Minister" meaning of the term. That party has ambitions to form an alternative Government, presumably with the Labour Party. The Labour Party Members can speak for themselves but I do not believe any Government will be formed on the basis of unilateral repudiation of clear Government commitments. One can argue that the Government should never have entered into such commitments but it is a more serious matter to urge the Government to repudiate them. I do not believe Fine Gael would do that. As I pointed out to the Fine Gael Leader on the "Questions and Answers" television programme, the then leader, Deputy John Bruton's, attitude to social partnership led him to oppose the 1994 agreement but that opposition melted like snow under sun the moment he got into Government. No responsible Government can  repudiate commitments. All this is shadow boxing and a way for the Senator to get back at his party's rivals, represented at this debate by the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. However, I will leave politics aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I am satisfied with the continuing high level of spending on infrastructure. We are spending about 5% more of GNP on infrastructure than our European neighbours. We need to do that. There might be a marginal adjustment in infrastructural spending in the budget but I am not convinced that we should break our necks to do it. If one tries to do too much too quickly, it simply increases the cost and causes inflation. One does not get a proper bang for one's buck.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_294">Socialism has a number of characteristics. The social partnership model is fully within the social democratic philosophy. Another characteristic is a high level of public investment. Fianna Fáil has been good on that front over the past few years. That subject was not given any importance by the rainbow Government as it approached the election in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The Government has a good record on social welfare. In fact, it was re-elected partly on the basis of the large child benefit increases. In all fairness, however, it should be pointed out that Proinsias De Rossa, as Minister for Social Welfare, gave substantial increases in that area too. That policy stretched across two Governments. The Government's re-election was also due to what was done for old age pensioners, which was unique to this Government. Another factor was the fulfilment, over a period of years, of the recommendations of the commission on social welfare. Members will remember the then Minister, former Deputy Gemma Hussey, saying a number of years ago that the country simply could not afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Any Minister with responsibility for social welfare must have the freedom to review schemes and priorities in the context of the positive budgetary plans they have. Some of the reductions that have been mentioned will have to be judged in that light. The detailed press release by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, on the social welfare changes offers a rationale for each of the changes. One cannot describe them in quite such stark terms as have been used recently and there is no real comparison with the situation in 1992. The diet supplement is being phased out and, with regard to the rent supplement, there are provisions for exceptions for people who are homeless or where there are other compelling reasons. These changes and their impact appear to have been thought through but many organisations will make representations in the month or two before the Social Welfare Bill is introduced, so there could be adjustments to minimise any hardship.  One cannot judge the impact until one knows what will be in the budget for social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I welcome the increase for primary school buildings in the Estimates. I wish it was more but it is almost €30 million extra and it is much needed. There has been some controversy about third level education. The resources are going into increased maintenance grants, which the Minister negotiated last year, and the restoration of science research funding. However, a problem remains in the current expenditure needs of colleges and that might need to be examined further. I welcome the confirmation that free fees were intended for the benefit of the middle income group. Listening to the Labour Party, one would not always have received that impression. There is a substantial difference between this and what Donogh O'Malley did. His was a genuine attempt to achieve equality of educational opportunity, not just for the benefit of the middle class.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I welcome the agriculture Estimate, which I am sure is of personal interest to the Minister of State. There is substantial extra funding for the very worthwhile REP scheme, which I welcome. I also welcome forestry back under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and Food because there is far more synergy there. I hope it means we will get away from a "stop, go" situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I am pleased the Estimates incorporate at least the maintenance of community employment schemes at current levels. There were reports in the media that funding for community employment schemes would be slashed even further. These are important schemes, particularly for the older age groups. They also provide an indispensable service, particularly in many provincial towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I welcome the restoration of funding for the arts. Facilities are now spread throughout the country. I am pleased there has been an increase in the overseas development assistance budget. I understand it will remain at approximately 0.41% of GNP. I had hoped we would be able to move further in this regard, but at least we are not going backwards. The Taoiseach reiterated in recent months that we made a solemn commitment, particularly in the context of seeking UN Security Council membership, to increase our ODA budget to 0.7% of GNP by 2007. I hope this will be taken seriously by the Government because it pertains to our honour and contribution in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Like Senator Higgins, I would like to see in the Budget Statement some kind of road map on decentralisation, which is a worthwhile objective that will require political courage. Its exact timing may be another matter. I would like to see at least the first phase implemented well before the next general election. It is a good idea in principle from which we should not draw back, because inevitably some people will be disappointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I want to refer briefly to yesterday's meeting of Finance Ministers. I made this point twice already today, once during Mr. McCartin's visit here and again when members of the Economic and Social  Committee of the European Parliament appeared before the Committee on Finance and the Public Service. The public coverage of the meeting misses an important point. It indicates that the big countries are getting away with something with which small countries would not be allowed to get away. I am speculating here because I have no inside knowledge. I think there is another issue at stake here, which is the degree of control the European Commission should have over national budgetary policy. The Government is remarkably close to the French and German Governments on this issue, which is that basically within very broad parameters national budgets are a matter for national governments and not for close supervision.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">This is a sort of power struggle. Naturally, the EU Commission wants to centralise issues as much as possible but most member states want to resist this. There is no evidence that either the French or Germans want to kick over the traces. They want to get their economies in better order and reform them as soon as possible. In the very short term – one is talking about the very short term when one speaks of budgets for one or two years – growth and stability are not always totally compatible objectives. Their argument is that if they go for growth first, they will get stability afterwards. I would not like to see this feed into a paranoia about big countries versus small countries. It was a pragmatic decision and I suspect we went along with it for the reasons I have stated. Of course, one must take care it does not have a negative effect on confidence and, therefore, on interest rates and the costs we all must pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I conclude by welcoming the Estimates as the first stone in the arch of the budgetary process, which I consider a good start.</p>

While I agree with much of what he said, I wish to put on the record that I found it very unconvincing when he said that the Minister and the Government decided to take the stance they did on the issue of the Stability and Growth Pact because it was a pragmatic decision. I am always suspicious of people who talk about pragmatic decisions. When I do it myself, I feel I do so without conviction. When one says one is being pragmatic, one is effectively saying one is throwing all one's principles to the wind for reasons which are purely and utterly practical, opportunist and not admirable or long term.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">The Senator is correct in that it was a pragmatic decision, but I believe it was the  wrong one. It appears very straightforward. These countries were in breach of the pact. One cannot just tear it up if it does not suit at any stage in one's political programme. There were two reasons for this. The first is probably that Ireland will soon assume the European Presidency and the Minister, for all his bottle in the past, was not prepared or was under instructions not to offend the large countries. It would be very difficult if we took over the Presidency while at war with the French and Germans. It would be embarrassing and it would not suit the political cosmetics and choreography if they came here and were not great friends of ours. I suspect a deal was done under the counter about which we know nothing and perhaps there will be a political pay-off for someone in the future. It was an extraordinary decision for the Government, which was censured for a similar offence, that it did not take advantage of its position and kick the Germans and French in the teeth because they need it. These guys are the political bullies of Europe.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_311">These are the people Ireland should stand up against when it gets the opportunity. I regret we did not stand up to them when they were in blatant breach of a pact which they initiated, particularly the Germans. As the euphemism goes, this issue will be revisited and, I hope, re-examined. I hope we will discover the real reason the Government took this position, but for the moment it is inexplicable, despite Senator Mansergh's laudable attempts to give an unconvincing explanation. I agree with much of what he said in his contribution. The Irish economy has come through a very difficult period with some credit to the Government. It has not been particularly easy to ride out this recession. Undoubtedly, there have been problems and we have spent too much money in recent years. However, the figures as quoted by the Minister of State and Senator Mansergh are pretty good.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">It is a tough time to be in Opposition. Our growth rate exceeds that of all other EU member states, inflation is coming down, unemployment is down and nearly all the figures which are thrown at us by the Department of Finance at regular intervals are particularly healthy, a fact we should acknowledge. Whether that is by luck or by good management is a matter which will be debated here for many years. On the whole, apart from the spending issue, the Government has managed the economy reasonably well in what was a difficult period. Gross spending is expected to increase by 7% or 8% this year on last year. That is too much but it is a great improvement on last year. It is to the Minister's credit that he has been able to persuade his colleagues to bring down gross spending during a difficult period. It is notably difficult when one goes on a spending binge, as the Government did in recent years, to  curtail spending and the rate of growth. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, appears to have been able to do this despite benchmarking, which has given rise to so much debate throughout the nation and in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I wish to record my full support for Senator Higgins's comments about benchmarking. It is not an easy furrow for him to plough because the Fine Gael position on benchmarking will offend a large number of strong political lobbies and yet it decided to take that risk. I have already seen, as has everybody else, the spinning from the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach who say that benchmarking will not be automatic. They are picking out one or two little groups and saying they will not pay them because they are not doing enough work. That is what they did last weekend. They were spinning the Sunday newspapers as if there was no tomorrow. They did not say that about the nurses, teachers or the Garda Síochána but they will say it about small groups. This will enable them to say benchmarking was not automatic. They will say they stood up to five people here, half a dozen in Mayo, six in Sligo and a couple in Cork while the big battalions will pour in through the gap which was created. It will happen this weekend. None of the big ones will be picked off. There will be token battles with powerless groups which will be abandoned by the large trade unions by this time next week and brought back into line. That will be the end of the story and yet the Government will portray this as some sort of victory in the enforcement of benchmarking. Unfortunately, that is the way Government works here.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I was not impressed by some of what the Minister of State's comments on benchmarking. I do not believe for one moment that leading members of the Government believe in benchmarking as an effective way of insisting upon public service efficiencies, nor do they believe this award is merited from top to bottom by every public servant, because everybody knows it is not, in addition to which we cannot afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">We get into meaningless language when Ministers' scripts are written by public servants who benefit from benchmarking. The Minister of State stated: "Benchmarking accounts for just over one quarter of the expected increase in the pay bill." Presumably, this is true. However, just over one quarter is a large amount. Senator Mansergh said it is a small amount but to me €300 million is a large amount. One can do a great deal with €300 million. Estimates debates are usually shopping lists for Senators and Deputies. If that €300 million were saved, I presume many of the worthy demands of Members could be paid for. I do not believe the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon or his party leader believe in benchmarking but they believe it is not worth the candle to do anything about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The truth of the matter is that Senators and Deputies hold little power. Members of the Cabinet hold a lot of power but there is no doubt that  the most powerful group comprises the public service unions. No Minister stands up to this particular group. I welcome the fact that Fine Gael – I hope this would also be the case if the party were to get into Government – will stand up to this group because one of the problems in Ireland is that the public service unions are increasing the rate of tax for the rest of us. The fact is that the €300 million benchmarking award or as I maintain a great deal more, but I risk further interruption from Senator Mansergh if I say so, including pensions will be raised in taxes. There is no other way of raising this unless the Government wants to borrow for current purposes which it does not.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_318">I risked interruption and it was fulfilled as usual. What I regret about the speech on both sides of the House, which is indicative of what is happening in Irish politics, is as follows. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has been a great Minister for Finance. He has served seven years as Minister and has transformed the Irish economy, certainly the taxation system, with the assistance of the Progressive Democrats and others. He has reduced capital gains tax from 40% to 20% which was revolutionary, radical and welcome, income tax from the top rate of 48% to 42%, income tax at the standard rate of 27% to 20%, corporate taxes to 12.5% and for that he must be given immense credit. Undoubtedly, if he had said at the beginning of his term that he would do all this, there would have been rumblings within the Government benches at that prospect. The result of his actions has been electric, both devastating and positive for our economy. We would not have had the extent of the boom we have experienced had taxes not been reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Capital taxation reductions have resulted in capital revenue increasing and income tax reductions have contributed to the economic boom. All those great measures having been taken, why has it stopped here? For some reason, everything has gone into freeze during the past two or three years. The tax reduction programme has finished. The Minister appears to be paralysed. It is clear from the debate here that the issue of direct taxation rates, income tax rates, capital gains tax rates and corporate tax rates is dead. Nobody is saying anything about it. It may be, and I look forward to Senator McDowell's speech, that the Labour Party wants to raise these taxes. I do not know the answer to that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">However, I would have liked the Minister of State to have had the courage to say today that he wants to lower these taxes further. What is wrong with that? The top rate of tax is now frozen in a band somewhere between 42% and 45% and it is apparently unacceptable to move beyond these parameters. It is unacceptable to decrease the rate below 42% because public service sector unions are saying they will go no further. This is not in writing, but it is the deal. It  means we are seeing the end of a great crusade of reduction in taxation. Reductions in all these taxes could have been achieved if benchmarking had been suspended. The public servants, who were to benefit from it, would have had the benefit of the tax reductions themselves, in which case they would have nothing about which to bellyache.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">However, the Minister has stopped this programme apparently because outside forces, rather than inside forces, have agreed to it. I would like Members of the Opposition to speak out about this matter. It is difficult for Fine Gael to advocate a reduction in taxes because it has the Labour Party on its back and when one has a monkey like that on one's back, it is very difficult to escape from it. However, it would be refreshing if Opposition Members advocated a reduction in tax. There is nothing immoral about it. It might create more revenue in the form of capital gains tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I would like the Minister of State to address in his response the issue of the bank levy. I thoroughly approve of the levy for two reasons. First, it is punitive. The banks, given their behaviour in respect of DIRT and because of their immense profits, merit it. It has made no difference whatsoever to their profits, regardless of what they say. Will this levy be continued or is the bank lobby now so strong that it has got to the Minister again, such that it will be lifted in the coming year?</p>
          <p eId="para_323">My second reason for approving of the levy is because DIRT has penalised small savers for a very long time. Mortgagees and borrowers have benefited enormously from tax reliefs and low interest rates but those who have savings, particularly small savings, are being deprived of them every year because the rate of interest they are getting is obviously below that of inflation. It would be of enormous benefit to these people, particularly the elderly, if the Minister considered abolishing DIRT. They should not be penalised for saving, which is, after all, a great backbone and aid to the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_327">I thank my friend and colleague Senator Ross for generously allowing me some of his time. I echo what he said about the stability pact. It was a political decision in one respect, but it was a very bad one. If one looks back to the time when Ireland was an applicant to various aspects of the European project, Germany was the country that was toffee-nosed about it. It was not at all sure that we would be able to meet the criteria. It had a strong deutschmark and we all had to live up to its standards. Now, apparently, it can break the  pact with impunity because it is a strong country. This is causing real worry for those with mortgages in Ireland, for whom I have great sympathy. I have been able to pay off my mortgage – this is a luxury – and am glad to say I am not in their position. Those who have bought houses with low rates of interest on their mortgages, particularly young people, will be in very serious trouble. The economy could also be in trouble if we have negative equity and the value of houses drops.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I am very glad my distinguished colleague Senator Mansergh encouraged the Government to continue progress towards increasing our ODA budget to 0.7% of GNP by 2007. I hope his voice will be listened to in that regard. I will not discuss the matter at any length because we will be discussing it this evening. I will reserve my comments for that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Only the Minister, rather than this House, could adopt a proposal I made on the CAB legislation. I tabled amendments to try to secure the money that was taken from the drugs barons and target it directly at the very poor communities in the inner cities which have been bled of money and young life. The money should go directly back to those from whom it came because they are the ones who paid. My proposal was not accepted because it imposed a charge upon the Exchequer and the Seanad is not trusted with the national purse strings. Nevertheless, it is a good proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">In recent weeks I have noticed a wonderful playground at the top of Gardiner Street which is thronged with young people and their parents. This is the kind of development we need. If one wants to solve the crime problem in our inner cities, or go some way towards doing so, we should invest in education, including programmes such as Breaking the Cycle. It is cruel to give young people a glimpse of the promised land and dump them just when they are coming to the end of their primary education. I have stated before – I will reiterate this until I am successful – that programmes should be continued through second level and university because the role models for the young children are the drug tsars and crack cocaine bosses who drive around in large cars with their admiring attendants. This perception will be broken the first time a vet, lawyer or doctor from the same background as these young people, and who has come through the same system, drives back into his neighbourhood in his nice car, thus showing that one can have a good life and also contribute to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Let me consider car tax, at the risk of appearing selfish. I do not normally read the motoring supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i> but I read it today and noted that vehicle registration tax is being increased further. I have a very flash car, a Jaguar XJ6. It is 12 years old and I got it for €5,000, yet I am paying €2,000 in tax. This is absolutely bizarre and insane. There should be a diminution in motor tax on cars as they get older, thus benefiting poor people like myself who like large  cars. However, there are much more important issues, such as the cuts in respect of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I am not normally a knocker or begrudger but my outlook changes when I consider champagne Charlie and the Punchestown syndrome in light of the removal of support for people with children in crèches. There were parents on the radio this morning who pay €63.50 per week for crèche services, but they probably will not be able to afford this after the cuts. This is shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The disabled are vulnerable and the amounts of money required to address their needs are comparatively small. For goodness' sake, let us look after them. It is in our long-term interest to do so, certainly in terms of our honour and the moral welfare of the country. The Combat Poverty Agency acknowledges that households headed by a person with a disability are disproportionately hit in terms of poverty levels. Of all households headed by a disabled person, 54.4% are living at or below the 60% poverty line according to the ESRI report of 2002. This is a reproach to society. We should accept what various groups are saying, namely, that we should examine the cost of a disability payments scheme so the disabled will have assistance in terms of equipment, travel, home appliances, etc. I am happy with this suggestion and it should be acted upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I strongly believe that a disability payment should and could be initiated in the budget. In addition, the report of the interdepartmental working group on the cost of such a payment should be published. This group is dispassionate, clear and clinical. We could then see the situation and act on it politically. The disability allowance should be brought into line with the contributory old age pension.</p>

There is a means test for them which is incredibly mean – it is a mean test. People devote their lives to looking after elderly relatives but if they dumped them on the State it would cost dear. Why not be flexible and generous? The submission acknowledges the great benefit gained by the grant of €500,000 towards the cost of travel for rural elderly from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. That is an imaginative grant. Mr. Charles Haughey is often excoriated but one thing for which he is remembered North and South is the introduction of free travel for the elderly.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">The matter of the homeless needs to be addressed because, for example, of the changes in the housing income support under the SWA rent supplement scheme. There are 60,000 people who rely on this and they are the most vulnerable people in our society. Requiring them to be in accommodation for six months before they can get a grant is a catch-22. How can they get into accommodation? I do not understand that, it is bizarre. There are some increases and I see the Minister of State just getting ready to tell me so. There is a 3% increase but it was cut by 5% last year. Even I who am almost totally innumerate can see that they are still being disadvantaged. We will have greater opportunity to debate these issues when the budget proposals are framed.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">We need to bear in mind as a principle that the Government should not only encourage the wealthy in this idea that they will create jobs and so on, but must also provide a net for the most vulnerable. It should continue with projects such as developing the playground in Gardiner Street. That will do more good than we can possibly imagine, and I urge the Minister of State to try to keep the Breaking the Cycle scheme up to third level. He has no idea of the change that will make in our inner cities.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">I hope Senator Norris will be able to continue to enjoy the luxury of his Jaguar at no great expense. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his contribution to the debate. There is no denying that over the past 12 months we faced a challenging economic situation. The major international economies performed poorly, the American boom slowed markedly despite comments last evening that showed a sharp increase there in the last two months. The German economy, the largest in the eurozone, is almost stagnant. International confidence has been low and the whole climate of uncertainty was exacerbated over the last 12 months by the conflict in Iraq. The impact here was quite clear. The pace of economic growth moderated, tax revenues were less buoyant and the scope for increased public spending was further limited. The challenge facing the Government is to guide the country successfully through this difficult period and to ensure that Ireland is well placed to take advantage of the international uplift when it comes, as today's OECD report highlighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">My party has played a key role in the formulation of Irish economic policy since returning to Government in 1997. Our policies have worked  and nobody denies that. We have moved this country from mass unemployment to full employment. We have virtually eliminated long-term unemployment and we have ended the curse of emigration, which was such a blight for so many years. I will offer some suggestions as to what our economic priorities should be over the next four years. The first requirement is to secure and preserve the prosperity which we have now achieved. It took us a long time to get the monkey of unemployment off our back and it would be a tragedy if we allowed it to return. We have a pro-employment tax system. It took significant effort on our part and on the part of the people to put it there. Our key objective now must be to keep it there. The temptation to raise personal taxes is always present, particularly at a time of slowdown in our economic growth, but it must be resisted. Full employment was a prize worth fighting for and it is worth defending. If we want to do that we must keep taxes down. The low-tax formula works so let us stick with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">It is imperative that the Government invests in the economy, especially the key infrastructural projects which are essential if we want to keep moving and remain competitive internationally. Dublin and Cork are the two major cities and economic centres and yet, eight decades after independence we do not have a proper road running between the two of them. We are quite literally kilometres behind the rest of the European Union in terms of transport infrastructure. We are beginning to make progress. Record sums of money are going into the National Roads Authority which is responding to the challenge. The next three years will see a transformation of our national road system. The motorway link from Dublin to Dundalk has been completed. The Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway project, a vital part of in the Dublin-Galway link, will be open in three years and with the completion of the Kildare and Monasterevin bypass projects we will have a continuous stretch of motorway and dual carriageway between Dublin and Portlaoise by early 2006. These will be impressive achievements. They will bring badly needed relief to road users around the country and improve the quality of life significantly in the towns which are being bypassed. We must keep the pace of investment going. We need to keep moving on the national roads programme if we are going to provide this country with the kind of infrastructure and transport system which it needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">We need public investment in other areas as well. Our hospitals, education and railway systems need investment. This involves money which is scarce in the current economic situation but long-term investment should not fall foul of short-time pressures. The Progressive Democrats have always been in favour of prudent borrowing to fund capital spending. It would be very foolish to cut back on investment now and then find that when economic buoyancy returns we have congestion and public facilities which are even worse than before. The rules laid down in the Stability  and Growth Pact set limits on the amount we can borrow in any given year. It is a pity that those rules do not distinguish between capital and current spending. We all recognise the need to keep current spending under control and to live within our means, as we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Our public finances are still in an extremely healthy position. We are still running substantial surpluses on the current account. We do not have a fiscal crisis or anything approaching it. We have the lowest government debt ratio of any country in the eurozone but because of the way in which the Stability and Growth Pact works we are constrained in our ability to spend on essential infrastructure, which is needed if we are to achieve our full economic potential. I doubt that the architects of monetary union had this in mind when they framed the pact. By all means let us have stability but let us have growth as well. The Government has a strong vested interest in modifying the pact. In light of yesterday's decision not to censure Germany and France for breaching the terms of the pact, the time is right to have the Stability and Growth Pact revisited to take cognisance of low debt countries with severe infrastructural deficits.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I appeal to the Minister of State to address the ongoing issue of the Cork School of Music, which is being delayed as a result of the terms of this pact. Every time I raised this matter in the House, the main reason given to me for the delay was the restraint placed on us by the pact. This argument is somewhat flawed, if not completely obsolete in light of yesterday's occurrences. I ask the Minister of State to end this ongoing issue, a very serious one for Cork as the school of music is likely to be the linchpin for the city's status as European capital of culture in 2005. This is a pilot project. Not only will Cork face embarrassment but so too will the country if the issue is not immediately addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Prudent borrowing for public investment makes eminent sense. It smoothes the economic cycle and helps to avoid boom-bust economics. This is what the Irish economy requires right now. Naturally we need to get value for money in return for public investment. We must take a serious look at the systems and institutions in place for managing infrastructural investment in particular. Are they effective, are they efficient and how do they compare with their European counterparts? Do they need to be overhauled? The Government must ask itself these questions and provide proper answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I welcome the publication of the Estimates and the provision for more than €40 billion in public spending next year. That is well over €10,000 for every man, woman and child. The €40 billion is provided by the hard work of the Irish people. The Government's first job is to manage the public money and invest it wisely on behalf of the people. That means delivering the public services they expect, getting value for public money and  spending it within a sustainable social and economic strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">With these Estimates, the Government has set priorities within limited and precious public resources. At 5% growth pre-budget, public spending is being increased at a moderate rate that will not put a strain on jobs and the economy. Steady progress is being maintained within the limits for our economy, with no exaggerated spending or exaggerated curtailment in spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">To grow public spending in line with our economic ability to pay puts the focus on the policies to achieve our economic potential. The Government has shown in recent years that economic performance is the engine of social justice, public resources and sustainable public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I note in the Estimates that the Government has prioritised investment in our social and economic future in the areas of health, education and infrastructure. Regarding comments by previous speakers on crèches, child care has become a major issue in Ireland. It is time to examine carefully how we fund child care projects, and to look at the under-utilisation of the resources we have, such as our schools system. Rather than continuing the policy of funding garage conversions in order that people can run small crèches, I am much more interested in utilising the structures already in place, such as our school system. In other countries I have seen where parents' associations can take over the school infrastructure after normal school hours, provide crèche facilities to incorporate play areas, study areas and so on, and keep those schools functioning until 7 p.m. I do not see why the money we are investing in crèches should not be directed towards that area, and such developments encouraged. It is not acceptable to fund garage conversions when we already have an infrastructure which could be properly utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">I welcome the commitment of the €340 million investment in research and development across Science Foundation Ireland, health research and Teagasc, as this will deliver long-term rewards. Next year, €10 billion will be spent on health. Health spending is up 43% in the three years since 2001, the most recent year for OECD statistics. No other European country has increased health spending at this rate. In France, for example, the government indicated that health spending increases in 2001 and 2002 of 4% at constant prices were "particularly steep".</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The Government is making the investment; it has brought forward the reform package and now is the time for action and results. I hope the Government is totally determined to implement the health reform that will put patients first. This will be done step by step, beginning now and continuing over the coming years, backed by sustained political will. Those who express opposition to these proposals based on their own vested interests and short-term gain do not have people's long-term interests at heart. Credible opposition should be expressed with credible alternatives but to date I have seen none.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Regarding the hotels and holiday homes scheme, a deadline was put in place in last year's budget for completion of these schemes. The criteria were that planning permission had to be lodged by 31 May 2003, the application validated, and construction completed by December 2004. The first deadline has passed and there is therefore a finite number of schemes that can be completed. However, the second deadline is producing a potential logjam both from the construction point of view and the hotel operational point of view. To get schemes completed on time, considerable resources will have to be employed. If the deadline were extended by six months, for example, it would take the pressure off everyone – developer, builder, hotelier, operator etc. As there is a finite number of schemes because of the deadline of 31 May 2003, there should be no loss to the Exchequer in bringing this about. I ask the Minister to consider these issues and address them in the budget rather than in the Finance Bill, because I fear that people building these schemes are entering into aggressive contracts now in order to be finished on time. Such contracts are in no one's interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The deadline for completion of section 50 schemes was also advanced in the last budget from December 2005 to December 2004. This has created a practical problem. Student years run from September to September and there is no point in having a unit finished in December when it will not be let until the following September. Given that this accommodation can only be used for student lettings, I respectfully suggest that this deadline be changed to September 2005 to correspond with the academic year.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I join previous speakers in welcoming the ringfencing of overseas development aid and the commitment of the Government in this regard. As previous speakers said, this will be debated later in the House and I will comment further at that stage. As for carers, we cannot underestimate their value to society. With our demographics indicating a major increase in the older population in the years ahead, we must now put in place systems which will care for older people. The burden carried by carers relieves the public sector and the Government of their responsibilities and in changing times where elderly people are no longer cared for by their family, we must reward those who take on such responsibilities. We must care for the elderly and ensure that carers and the elderly will be safeguarded in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Having availed of the opportunity to highlight some of the issues of concern, I will conclude by congratulating the Minister and his officials for their management of the economy in recent years and their commitment to ensuring that the decisions now being made are in the interests of the Irish people, not just in the short term, but in the short, medium and long term. All decisions of the Department of Finance and the Minister must be viewed in that light.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">I welcome the opportunity to address the issues raised by the Estimates.

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_361">I did not have the same problem with Senator Ross. I managed to get through his contribution without agreeing with any of it. If the opposite was the case, I would be worried.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I am not sure that Senator Minihan's comments sit comfortably with Government policy. He said we should not be deflected from prudent borrowing simply to stay within the stability pact. He also suggested that we should operate a counter-cyclical economic policy in this State, an idea the Minister for Finance does not support. It is worth dwelling on this point. The current Government's policy has been dictated by political, not economic, considerations. The spending splurge before May 2002 was intended to smooth the way through the general election, and it did, and the current belt tightening is to facilitate a similar splurge before the next general election. We will see if it works.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The primary function of these splurges was political but the Minister tells us that we should spend when we have the money and withhold when we do not. That makes no sense, it is unwise to prime the pump when it is working and a bad idea to cut off the flow of money that will be needed to prime it when things have slowed dramatically. We are not in recession by any stretch of the imagination, where I would take the Keynesian approach and argue that money should be spent to stimulate the economy, but I disagree with the Minister's pro-cyclical approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">That is the point I made earlier. What he does is determined by political considerations, not what he claims to believe economically. There is a serious difference of view between us on the issue. It is reflected in how we approached the last few days in Brussels. What happened this week was the inevitable outworking of a pact that is fundamentally flawed. I agreed with the President of the European Commission, Mr. Prodi, when he called the pact stupid and said that the defects in it have been clear for a long time. I also agree with the Dutch Minister for Finance who said the pact is effectively dead. It is a pity it has come to this, although it was inevitable, but the pact will have to be revisited in circumstances that are less than ideal. The opportunity existed for some years to revisit it and to put in place a genuine Stability and Growth Pact that would respect both sides of the  equation because they do not pull in the same direction all the time. If that had been in place several years ago, we would not be where we are now – faced with the grubby deal that emerged in Brussels this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I heard some of Senator Ross's German bashing but no one can argue that the Germans should not be spending money. Their economy is stagnant and for the German Government to cut back further would undoubtedly result in a tailspin that would bring the German economy into serious recession within a short time.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I agree with Senator Minihan that we must take account of two factors. We must take account of the debt to GDP ratio and the level of unemployment in particular countries and the point in the economic cycle each country is at. The first is easy because it can be defined in simple terms, those who have a low debt to GDP ratio should be allowed to borrow for structural purposes and those that do not should do so with great caution or not at all. Italy still has an enormous debt to GDP ratio and is not in the same position as Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The second consideration is more complex. It is difficult to say that if Germany is in danger of recession, it should be allowed to spend more money. The only way to achieve this is to introduce a measure of discretion into the pact – the current reality – although the rules are supposedly rigid, and take into account the point in the economic cycle countries are at. When we are dealing with countries as powerful as Germany and France, that becomes inevitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">I do not believe for one minute that the Cork School of Music has been held up because of the European Stability and Growth Pact.</p>

          <p eId="para_371">I have no expertise in the matter but the costs of the project have not escalated over recent years because the facilities that will be provided have been improved. I do not know who worked out the initial costs or the current costs but something has gone seriously wrong with the project. If the current costs on a PPP basis are correct, we should start again because it is a huge amount of money. Something has gone seriously wrong and it cannot be blamed on the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">In normal circumstances, a year on year increase of 7% in the Estimates would be about right, given that a certain percentage is for benchmarking, which is a once-off increase. It is perhaps on the low side and I would go a couple of points higher. I have serious difficulties, however, with some of the details, particularly on the capital side. We debated this some weeks ago and I made the point that we need to maintain capital spending even when the economy is not growing rapidly. Senator Minihan agreed with that during his contribution but that was not what we saw in  the Estimates last week. The increase in the overall capital budget is tiny if the non-Exchequer element is excluded, only a couple of tens of millions of euro, and is a reduction in real terms.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_374">Yes, it is a reduction at this point in real terms compared to the amount spent last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Much of it is being spent under a few major headings, the most obvious of which is roads. Senator Dooley is here so we should acknowledge that the Ennis bypass is once more at the starting line and we should hope it crosses it some time during the year. I look forward to the ribbon finally being cut. Senator Minihan listed the roads he expects will be in place before 2006, the 70 kilometres to Portlaoise and the motorway to the Border. The entire network was supposed to be in place by 2006, a much more extensive list of projects than those the Senator listed. The programme is way behind schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">We should be spending more on roads. It was inevitable that we would not even be in a position to spend money in the first couple of years because the planning and design was not done in many cases. Extra money was spent two or three years ago on planning and design and some of those projects are now in a position where they could go ahead if the money was available. In simple terms, this is not a straight line. We are not looking at a situation where one would spend the same amount on motorway construction over a period of seven years, but where it will start low and bulge around the middle, which is the position at present. However, there is no bulge because we are spending money on a very small number of projects next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The NRA is suggesting there will be 12 or 13 major projects and no more than that. To put it in context, €1.3 billion is a lot of money but when one is spending approximately a third of it on the Dublin Port tunnel, it puts it into context. To be anywhere near meeting the targets for the motorway projects – we are not going to meet them – we need to spend a great deal more on them than we are currently intending to spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The Minister for Finance and the public service would say that we did not get the best value for money in the first two years. In truth, he is right. There is no doubt that when the construction industry was at full belt a couple of years ago, the industry's inflation rate was running well ahead of the rest of the economy. We were not getting the value on the return that we needed. We are not in that situation now. Clearly, the construction industry has slowed down somewhat. Labour is available in a way that it has not been for the past few years. We would not have the same downside risks in terms of increasing expenditure on motorways now and that is what we should be doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">On the subject of health, it has been the primary political focus not just for the past 18  months since the general election, but for a year or two previously. The Government clearly, and rightly, anticipated in the period before the last general election that it would be the primary political issue and it commissioned the health strategy to assuage an increasingly angry electorate. I have spoken before about the health strategy in this House and elsewhere. It is an imaginative strategy and if it was implemented, it would improve the health service. However, it comes at a considerable cost, which is acknowledged in the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Within six or seven months, the Minister for Finance has made a nonsense of it and he has made it clear since the general election that he has no intention whatsoever of delivering on it. Sadly, if we look at the provision in the health capital budget this year, it is slightly down on last year, €504 million in comparison to €511 million. The amount needed if we are to make any progress whatsoever on the delivery of the health strategy would be at least twice and probably three times that figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The Minister is entitled to point out that we have spent significantly more and are spending more now on the health service compared to ten years ago. However, for a whole range of reasons, be they demographics or whatever and not least because we started off with a seriously underfunded and inequitable system, we needed to spend much more and needed the increases in spending that were provided. Much of that increase needs to go towards increased capacity. However, in view of the Estimates provided by the Minister for next year, that cannot be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">It might be useful to put that in the context of the Hanly report. There is much good in the report and if we are looking for value for money, we need to go down the road suggested by Hanly. However, we cannot really expect people living in places such as Nenagh, Ennis or Roscommon to accept the Hanly report if they see no effort being made by the Government to deliver on the improved services that would be necessary for them to accept the broad rebalancing within the regions the report proposes. To put that simply, if we say to people that we will introduce an ambulance service but we do not provide resources for it, or that we will improve local delivery in places like Ennis and Roscommon for services other than accident and emergency but there are no resources, or we will increase the number of consultants but we make no provision for that, it is not difficult to understand why people are sceptical.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">If the downside is that they lose local services, but the upside in terms of improved primary care and ambulance services is not delivered, what can one expect except tens of thousands of people on the streets of Nenagh and Ennis, which is what will happen? It will be almost impossible for those who would like to look at the positive side and to support the general policy thrust to do it because we do not expect that the plus side or the whole package will be delivered. Unfortunately,  in the Estimates, there is all too much evidence for those who see in the Government a lack of willingness to deliver the improved primary care, ambulance services, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Mention was made by others of ODA. I will not be speaking in the debate later so I will mention it as it is something in which I have taken an interest. It would be fair to acknowledge that ODA has improved fairly consistently since 1993 and that the Government has played a part in that regard. Some years ago the Department of Foreign Affairs, when Deputy O'Donnell was the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, agreed a multi-annual budget with the Department of Finance. That was, by and large, delivered. The Taoiseach, two or three years ago, announced that as part of the Government's then strategy to win a seat at the Security Council, we would increase our ODA commitment to meet the UN target of 0.7% by 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The sad reality is that there is no longer any multi-annual commitment in that regard. At the current rate of increase, we will not meet the 2007 target and NGOs and even bilateral aid cannot work on the basis of stop-go decisions. It does not allow for planning or for projects to be put in place if one does not know from one year to the next exactly how much money will be available for investment in particular projects. This is something in which people in all parties have an interest. It will not cost a huge amount of money, but we need to get it right. We need to agree it on a multi-annual basis so that we know, over three or four years, how much will be spent. I appeal to the Government to look at the ODA budget for the next three years, assuming it will be in power that long, and to set out in clear monetary terms exactly how it intends to reach the 0.7% target in three years, if that remains its intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">We had a debate in the House a few weeks ago during the Labour Party's Private Members' time and I do not want to repeat what I said then, or what others on these benches said. However, I want to put down a couple of markers for the budget next week. The Government is committed to increasing the old age pension to €200 a week. It is also committed, under its review of the NAPS, to increasing the lowest level of social welfare payment to €150 in real terms before the end of its term, which will, in effect, be about €180 by that time. That will not be achieved if we try to increase social welfare payments by the level of inflation. It will require a payment of at least double the rate of inflation to make it possible to stay on course to meet those targets. I put down this marker now that we will expect the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to deliver on this when the budget is announced next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">In that context, the cuts Senator Higgins referred to so eloquently earlier are really difficult to take. The overall saving probably will be less than €60 million and I do not know why the cuts have been introduced. One suspects, when  one looks at the provision on the rent allowance, that it has more to do with turf wars between individual Departments than with any refocussing of benefits. They are petty and, unfortunately, the effect on individuals who will be affected by them will be considerable. They are targeted at those who are most vulnerable and least able to look after themselves. I hope, in the context of the budget and as we move into next year, that the Government will find it possible to reverse at least the two or three most prominent cuts in the rent allowance and the back to education allowance, which we all agree should not have been introduced. These cuts should be reversed and I hope that will be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Senator Ross's comments were interesting, particularly those about low tax. The Labour Party is not in favour of high tax for the sake of it – I do not think anybody is, at least I hope not. I acknowledge that tax can and should play a role in redistribution within society; it is right that it should do so. However, primarily, at this point in the economic cycle and in our development, the Labour Party is interested in securing as much as is necessary from the taxation system to provide a decent level of public service. Some of those services should be provided free at the point of delivery, some should be provided on a universal basis and some should be provided at a cost to some people, but not to others. If I was framing a budget, I would look at priorities in terms of service provision and at ways of finding the money from taxation or elsewhere to finance them. That is the difference between Senator Ross and the Labour Party. Senator Ross believes taxation is bad and should be reduced to the basic minimum, while the Labour Party takes a different view. We look at the service which is needed and try to find the money to pay for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I cannot help but refer to what the Minister of State said earlier about stealth taxes and his suggestion that there is no such thing. Some of the charges are justifiable, such as the increase in the television licence, for example. It is reasonable to ask people to make a contribution to services. However, to suggest that there is not a programme of stealth taxes is asking us to swallow a lot. There have been significant increases under a range of areas, such as the drugs payment refund threshold which has been increased from €53.33 to €78 per month. That is an increase of approximately €300 per year for someone who buys drugs on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, many people are in that position. The costs of visiting accident and emergency departments and of staying in public hospital beds have increased, as well as the VHI rates. Virtually all the public utilities, such as the ESB and the gas company, have increased their charges well beyond the rate of inflation. That does not happen by accident. The Government's policy is to increase indirect taxes either by straightforward means, such as excise duties, or through charges made by public utilities  rather than increasing direct taxes or capital taxes.</p>

          <p eId="para_393">That is a separate agenda, which we could debate, on what the future holds for the ESB or how regulation works in the electricity supply service. Unfortunately, it is one of the disadvantages of competition in a service such as electricity supply or generation. It is argued that it is necessary to increase the price before we can have competition. There is a separate argument about the ESB in which we should not get involved. The Government should be honest and clearly acknowledge that there is such a policy and defend it on the basis that it wants to keep direct taxes down. That is fair enough, but it should be honest and upfront about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I echo what other Members said about section 481. I am not one of those who takes the view that one should cut out all tax reliefs or tax loopholes, as some people call them. One must look at tax relief schemes in the context of what they are trying to achieve. If they are not achieving something which would not otherwise happen, then it is fine to cut them out. However, there is evidence that section 481 has stimulated the film industry in a positive way. A few years ago the Minister tried to improve the verification processes. In other words, he changed the criteria regarding the need to give local people a certain number of jobs and the need to generate money locally as well as ensuring that a certain amount came from elsewhere. The evidence suggests that was broadly successful. There is some evidence that in the absence of film relief or other incentives to the film industry, the industry in this country will be at a significant disadvantage internationally. Before the Minister carries out his threat to eliminate the relief, he should look at it one last time because it merits it and there is cross-party support for its continuation.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I am conscious that this is an in-between debate in that we have only part of the information and the rest will come next week in the budget. We will have another bite of the cherry next week.</p>

          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_396">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials from the Department of Finance to the House. As regards section 481, the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service met representatives from the film industry who made a good case for the retention of the relief. They clearly stated that the Irish film industry would collapse if the tax relief was abolished. We spoke to the Taoiseach at the parliamentary party meeting about that issue and we advised him that  it should be retained. The committee met excellent union people who represented actors and crafts people and they pleaded for the tax relief to be kept in place. I am optimistic that it will be kept because it would be crazy to abolish it. There are 4,500 people employed in the film industry and 3,500 young people are currently studying to enter the movie industry because it is a glamorous business. If the tax relief is abolished, the film industry in Ireland will collapse because other countries are copying our success.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I remind Members that 30 years ago we joined the European Economic Community. The Industrial Development Authority of Ireland set out to brand Ireland as the best location in Europe for international investment. Dr. William Harris, the chief executive officer of Science Foundation Ireland, said that the strategy over the past 30 years has been most successful for this country and has left the world in awe of our accomplishments and achievements. He also said it is a role model for other developing countries throughout the world. We have moved from an agricultural economy to a manufacturing one. When the unemployment rate was more than 18%, thousands of young people emigrated every year. However, the opposite is the case today. Some 95% of people are employed and, to date, 41,000 people from poorer countries have come to this country looking for jobs. No one would have believed that would happen when we joined the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I warn Members and those in Government that in May next year ten new eastern European countries will join the EU – Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia and the Mediterranean countries of Malta and Cyprus. These new entrants to the EU want what we have and they will compete fiercely on the basis of price and performance just as Ireland has done. It is more difficult to stay on top than people realise. It is easier to get to the top than to stay there. One has only to look at Manchester United and other football teams to see what can happen. It is easy to become complacent whether one is in business, education or Government. The challenge is to remain focused on performance and facts if we want to sustain our development.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">I have a few facts which relate to the future performance of the economy. The recent OECD chart for Government research and development spend as a proportion of GDP shows that Ireland is ranked 22 out of 24 countries. We are at the bottom of the league. According to the expert group on future skills needs, there is an annual shortfall of 2,500 trained professionals from third level for the years 2000 to 2005. We also have an annual shortfall of 800 technicians and we have 25% fewer engineering or science graduates than three or four years ago. How will that help to sustain the development of high technology in our economy?</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The Estimate for the Tánaiste's Department in 2004 is €1.2 billion, which is an increase of 3%  over last year. Overall spending on science and technology will increase by 36% over 2003 levels. The bulk of this will go to Science Foundation Ireland to fund its ambitious research programme. SFI was given a statutory title this year. Its job is to be the national foundation for excellence in scientific research, playing a key role in developing Ireland as a globally recognised centre of research excellence. Dr. William C. Harris, whom I mentioned earlier, has said that human brain power will become the driving force of the world economy and that developing, recruiting and retaining talented people will be a necessity if Ireland is to play a leadership role in the world economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Outstanding research requires world-class scientists and engineers. World-class researchers are highly motivated. They are like thoroughbred horses. They compete and work very hard in the global market. They are born to compete. If we are to continue to attract high-technology companies against intense competition, develop our indigenous high-tech industry and show that our success over the last few years was not just a flash in the pan and that we can sustain a leading presence in high-technology industries, we must realise this is a complex and fast-changing sector and the challenges of advancing up the value chain are significant. It is vital that the Government's commitment to research and development does not waver. We need zealots and missionaries in organisations such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, who will drive this new development of brain power. Otherwise, we will not be able to compete.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">In the future when international companies are investing in this country they will want to know how many PhDs we have and in what subjects they did their theses. It will not be a matter of wanting to locate in Galway or anywhere else but about the calibre of young people we have. That is the world in which we are competing and there will be heavy competition from eastern European countries which have well educated young populations and are very anxious to be like us.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">At the parliamentary party meetings we stressed that Fianna Fáil members wanted to keep the CE schemes in place. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently said: "Combined participation levels on community employment, jobs initiative and social economy programmes will be maintained at end 2003 levels and no further reductions in numbers are envisaged in 2004." I welcome this major announcement for its common sense. The Minister has obviously been listening to what people on the ground – Fianna Fáil Party members and Members of the House – have been saying. I do not have to spell out the benefits of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">I attended the pre-budget submission of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Buswell's hotel about three weeks ago. Professor John Monaghan of Trinity College, the vice-president of the organisation, cried out for help from politicians. He wanted them to convey to the Government the needs of those who are not part of the Celtic tiger and that it should support these people. I was struck by one point he made, which went to my heart. He said there were 70,000 children living in consistent poverty in Ireland. We must share the wealth of the Celtic tiger with these people and with the Traveller community. The issue of Travellers is close to my heart. The society called for 300 extra houses to be built or refurbished next year. Yesterday I heard about people who are going to South Africa to build houses and it occurred to me that they should stay here and build houses for Travellers instead so that they do not have to live in squalor on the side of the road. These people had craft skills – they are carpenters, painters and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">It is the responsibility of politicians to look after those who are socially excluded. It is not all about balancing the books. I know the Minister for Finance was praised eloquently by Senator Ross, which was a great compliment to him, but he should try not to be an accountant all the time.  We must spend money on those who are not part of the success of the Celtic tiger, who are socially excluded and unable to participate. Another group we must consider, whose case was put forward so passionately by Senator Norris, are those who are disabled. We have had a successful year for people who are disabled, but we cannot just have rhetoric; we must deliver the goods. Disabled people are entitled to develop their potential and skills like the rest of us. I call on the Government to ensure that disabled people, no matter how they are disabled, have full rights. Travellers and people who cannot go out and earn a living should also be taken into consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">I agree with what Senator White said at the end of her contribution and I echo her sentiments. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Estimates in the run-up to the budget, which will take place next week. I am also delighted that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, seems to have come around to the idea of fiscal rectitude. We are all talking about how he is wielding his axe. "Fiscal rectitude" is a terrible term, which conjures up all sorts of images.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The question I have was eloquently outlined by the Minister of State when he spoke about Government spending increases over the past two years and how, in 2001, it ran to 21% and had been 15% the previous years. Where was the Minister for Finance's axe at that time? Why did he let things get so badly out of hand that we now find ourselves in our current position?</p>
          <p eId="para_437">While I do not know if this figure is correct, it has been brought to my attention that current spending by the Government, including the sums proposed in the Estimates, has increased by 58% over what was spent in 2000. While that seems like an astronomical increase, I have not had time to examine it. It is clear that despite how the Minister for Finance might pontificate, fiscal rectitude has not been particularly high on his list of priorities in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Other Members referred to aspects of the Estimates that will either lead to increased charges or reduced services. I am concerned about local government. For the second year in a row, the local government fund will remain more or less frozen. As a member of a local authority, the Acting Chairman, Senator Leyden, will be aware of the serious effect this will have. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government tells us almost daily about the need to introduce large development levies. His logic is that developers are making huge sums of money and some money must be taken from them. While that is laudable, surely he does not expect developers not to pass on this increase in its entirety to ordinary house buyers. People in Kilkenny are faced with the possibility of development charges of slightly more than €5,000 for once-off rural houses with no connection to anything. While this has been proposed under the current draft scheme, it has not been accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Local authorities find themselves in poor financial circumstances as funding from central Government remains stagnant. The cost of providing services is rising annually, yet there are few places where the authorities can find funds to pay for those improved services. The benchmarking  payments will cost Kilkenny County Council approximately €1 million this year and €2 million every year thereafter. This is a significant sum of money, particularly when it has to be raised locally. The result is that the council is being asked to adopt these crazy development charges that are effectively a tax on first-time buyers. As others pointed out, until last year we had the first-time buyer's grant and we now have the first-time buyer's tax that has been introduced by the back door.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Central Government has changed, in an underhand way, the system by which local government is funded. Until recently, sewerage schemes received 100% funding from the Department. Now, such schemes would be lucky to get 70% or 75% funding and the rest must be sourced locally. This leads to local authorities seeking higher development charges from the most vulnerable group in our society. We should be doing more to help people onto the property ladder. This flies in the face of the pronouncements about helping first-time buyers from the Government in recent years. The advent of the development charge runs contrary to the stated view of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">A number of Members mentioned infrastructure. I was struck by Senator Minihan's comments on infrastructure and I agree with him. It is disgraceful that many of our national primary routes are inadequate. The road linking Waterford and Dublin that runs through Kilkenny is, in parts, no more than a glorified cow path. It is not acceptable that such roads should exist in this day and age. Senator Minihan told the House on the Order of Business today that there were no disagreements among the junior partners in Government. Therefore, it is unbelievable that we should have to listen to his colleague, Senator Dardis, continually saying such roads should not be built. He says the roads programme, that will involve the building of motorways, should not take place. This is completely contradicted by what Senator Minihan said in the House. Even though there are only 12 Progressive Democrats Members of the Oireachtas, they are perfectly capable of arguing among themselves on serious political issues such as this one. It is particularly hypocritical in Senator Dardis's case as he fought a general election campaign that opposed the building of a motorway while his party is pushing through the building of this necessary motorway.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">I did not hear what he said. For the second consecutive year there is to be a cutback in the funding for Teagasc. This is significant at this time as agriculture is undergoing changes associated with the Fischler proposals. The reduced spending on Teagasc has caused general  unease in the farming fraternity around the country. Following last year's €17 million reduction, one can only assume that more of the advisory offices around the country will be closed if Teagasc is to continue functioning. Contrary to the pious aspirations of Government Deputies and Senators when they speak in their constituencies about how such advisory centres should be kept open at all costs, it seems the Department of Finance has no intention of providing for it. I am anxious to hear the response of the Minister of State to this matter. The Estimates also revealed a halving of the disease eradication allocation. This is a significant development and I would like to hear an explanation as to why this was deemed necessary and where the money taken from the scheme is to be spent in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">There have been a number of reductions in the Vote of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There has been a 4% decrease in funding for victim support and a 5% decrease in funding for bodies that are concerned with violence against women. This is an extraordinary reduction. There has been a 75% reduction in anti-racism awareness funding in the Estimates. While this has not been widely commented on, it is startling that it should come at this stage in the development of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">One of the great highlights the Government announced when it came to office was the appointment of the Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, as the new Minister for rural communities in particular and community and Gaeltacht affairs in general. The Estimates contain a 30% reduction in capital funding for Údarás na Gaeltachta and a 25% reduction in Gaeltacht improvement schemes. This flies in the face of one of the Government's main policies. The Government emphasised the creation of a Department specifically responsible for these areas.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_454">I did not expect that to be included. This highlights from the Opposition point of view that the major problem with the health service is not the provision of money. We all accept that vastly increased amounts of money are being spent in this area. However, where is the money being spent? Based on these figures, it is not being targeted on the health service <i>per se.</i> It is being spent on providing salaries for people who are not involved in providing front-line services. This is an issue the Government usually brushes under the carpet although it has stated it quite brazenly on this occasion, which is interesting to say the least.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I was also struck by the comment in the Minister of State's address that he wished to dispel the notion that the Government is seeking to introduce stealth taxes and promote increased charges in order to fund the proposed increases in public spending. He could have fooled me. Many stealth taxes and charges have been increased and are proposed as a result of this Book of Estimates. Members of my own family avail of the food supplement scheme. I was struck during the week to hear a man on the radio on a low income telling of the €45 per week he spent on special food supplements, which were covered up to this because he had a specific heart condition. I do not know what he was employed at but he will not be in a position to spend €45 a week from his income and will have to go without some of the supplements and therefore put his health at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The changes in the social welfare system announced in the Book of Estimates is probably the most disgraceful aspect of this. It is penny pinching of a miserly fashion which targets the most vulnerable in society. There is no excuse for this. I agree that schemes must be updated on a continual basis, but there is penny pinching and penny pinching, particularly with regard to food supplements, and that was really wrong.</p>

This is grand in certain areas where public transport exists but down in Kilkenny or Roscommon, where public transport is not an option, the car is necessary. We should look towards the future, putting the emphasis on emissions from cars rather than on engine size when it comes to motor taxation.

          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_460">I join with colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State and the publication of the Book of Estimates for this year. Great credit is due to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister of State and the entire Government for achieving this remarkable level of public spending again this year. There is a 5% increase in public expenditure despite the straitened economic circumstances we have witnessed for the last two years. That increase in public spending is particularly welcome against a backdrop of the decrease in inflation to 2.3%, announced on the same day. This, coupled with the increases as recognised, puts us in a strong position for the next 12 months. It will hopefully position us to benefit from the recovery in the US and other markets with which we trade and on which we are dependent for continued growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The 5% increase has been achieved without a return to the old economic norms of boom and bust, largely characterised by significant public borrowing. It would be easy to have a spending rate of 5% if we were to continue to borrow as in the past. However, there is a relatively small level of borrowing, in the region of €3 billion for next year. To achieve such a level of expenditure with limited borrowing is particularly good. That is largely driven by the Stability and Growth Pact from Europe. There has been much debate about that over the last few days. I would like to raise a particular issue with the Minister of State on the borrowing under that pact, particularly borrowing by local authorities. This is creating some concern in local authorities, particularly regarding projects that require significant financing, which will become self-sufficient at a later stage. I do not wish to be parochial but there is a significant project in north Clare, an interpretative centre connected with the Cliffs of Moher.

          <p eId="para_463">—which has already been applied for. There is no doubt that the project fits all the criteria set out in the capital project from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. One of the major stumbling blocks is the local authority's inability to borrow under the Government  guidelines and the current cap. Perhaps the Minister of State would examine this.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The envisaged €3 billion borrowing is totally insignificant when the level of investment in infrastructure is considered, as identified in the Estimates. It is great to see the national debt has halved since 1997. This provides in the region of an extra €1 billion which is used as investment in the public sector. We now see the benefits of not going back to that level of borrowing, which created many of the difficulties the Government has had to address in recent years. Thankfully, we have moved away from that. That the Government is in a position to spend as outlined in the Book of Estimates is a sign of a healthy economy. It is noteworthy that the public spend will be twice the EU average and that is a point of which we should be proud. There is no doubt that this has not come about by chance. Some people on the other side of the House believe this was destined to happen. It would not have happened without the prudent economic management exercised not just by the Department of Finance but by other Departments ensuring their spending remained within projected levels. Over the last 12 months they have ensured that their levels of spending have remained within the projections. The approach has been to consolidate when circumstances change or when faced with a downturn. The bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000, the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the foot and mouth outbreak and other developments created the recent difficult economic circumstances we have experienced. It is important to recognise these facts because when the economy picks up again people will tend to forget the difficulties that were overcome in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I am glad the Minister pointed out that public spending must be matched with revenue. Everybody understands the principles of budgeting in the home, in business and elsewhere. One cannot spend what one does not have. There are demands from numerous interest groups in a range of areas, all with justifiable cases and on behalf of good causes. However, nobody wants a return to increased taxation so only the amount of money that is collected can be spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The priorities identified in the Estimates are the most important – health, social welfare, education and infrastructure. As Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on transport in the Seanad, I am delighted that the high level of investment in roads has been maintained in the Estimates for next year. It matches the amount spent last year, which was historically high. Approximately €1.3 billion will be invested in the construction of motorways and dual carriageways. This will be spent on a number of projects that are about to be completed, and which were identified by other contributors to this debate, and on the commencement of other projects. As Senator McDowell indicated, the Ennis bypass is scheduled to go ahead early next year on the basis of this continued high level of investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">It is worthwhile comparing the allocation of €1.3 billion with spending in other countries. The Oireachtas transport committee met with representatives of the motorways authority of England recently. England is not spending anything like what Ireland is spending per head of population. The budget is approximately 75% more than this country's or about €2.3 billion even though the population is almost 18 times greater than ours. Our spending in this area is far greater but we are coming from behind in terms of provision so there is a deficit to be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I welcome the indication that the Departments of Finance and Transport are in the process of agreeing an envelope of funding of approximately €6 billion to be spent over a period of five years. This is most important for the development of infrastructure. If money is available in the Estimates, it is easier to negotiate the price of projects. The difficulty until now has been that spending is based on an annual allocation of funding. When this envelope is in place it will allow the Department to get better value and to deliver more projects. The allocation of €1.28 billion for roads is four times what was spent six years ago. There has been a major leap in funding. Over the next six years the envelope of €6 billion will allow us to reach a point where critical road infrastructure will have reached an acceptable level. At that stage the Government in power will have the capacity to divert some funding to other infrastructural projects, perhaps in the public transport network.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Since 2000, approximately 270 kilometres of high quality roads have been completed. Another 160 kilometres are under construction and 131 kilometres have been put to tender with most of the work to begin next year. Obviously, the Ennis bypass will figure in that group. More than half the Department's Estimate will go on 27 road projects. It is noteworthy to see a Department devote so much money to dealing with a recognised deficit. A welcome development, and something that must be considered in the future for other infrastructural projects, is the level of money coming through from the private sector through public private partnerships. A further €185 million is involved in the Kilcock and Kinnegad bypasses together with the Dundalk western bypass. This is hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">While there has been unprecedented investment in roads over the past five years, there has also been considerable investment, approximately €1 billion since 1999, in public transport. The total allocation for this year is €646 million and, of this, €366 million will be capital spending. This added to the EU grant of approximately €37 million amounts to more than €400 million for capital investment in infrastructural public transport projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">There is the usual subvention to the CIE group of companies, Dublin Bus, Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann. This will allow the companies to continue to upgrade their products. The Oireachtas transport committee also had an  opportunity to meet with representatives of London Transport to examine how they have dealt with investment in public transport and infrastructure. Even in a privatised network there was still a necessity to subsidise the ongoing operation of public transport. They indicated that in their experience there would always be a need, regardless of who managed the operation, for subvention to ensure the delivery of the service. The critical development with CIE is that service level agreements have been agreed between the three companies. Together with the subvention, that will ensure we get an output to match the Government's expectation, based on its input.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The considerable investment in the CIE companies over the last number of years was spearheaded by the Leader of the House. She ensured investment in Iarnród Éireann and arranged for the 80 new diesel railcars that will be brought into service later this year to improve the frequency of services in and around Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin. That was most welcome.</p>

I urge the Minister to do what he can to re-examine the Government's cap on borrowing by local authorities. It is most important for the future of some projects.</p>

One can see from the actions of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, that much has been learned from previous decades with regard to peaks and troughs in economic performance, both domestically and internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">If the Minister were to respond positively to some of the loudest calls from the Opposition and a tiny minority in the media, the country would quickly revert to the bad old days of the 1980s when, as a result of spend and bust and attempts to spend our way out of temporary difficulties, the country ended up worse off than ever. In fact, in 1987 the country was on the verge of bankruptcy. It required the courage of politicians such as the former Deputy, Ray MacSharry to bring the country caringly, prudently and courageously through it. It involved some extremely harsh decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_479">We have learned a great deal. The balance, insights and good judgment calls of  the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and how he has indicated future expenditure is proof of that learning process. I welcome his decisions and the publication of the Estimates. I welcome the Minister's decision not to try to spend our way out of a temporary difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I want to refer to the public service pay policy, an area which is attracting much comment due to the percentage of total spend being devoted to it. The most controversial aspect of the policy is benchmarking. The main Opposition party appears not to understand – its former leader in the mid 1980s did not appear to understand it either – that a commitment entered into should be honoured. In the mid 1980s, the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, sought to renege on a commitment entered into with teachers. I recall at the time he had to hijack RTE and other elements of the media to try to get over the heads of the teachers' unions to the people in a failed attempt to justify reneging on a deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">Benchmarking is an integral part of the national public pay policy which is enshrined in the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement. This process was started by Fianna Fáil in the late 1980s and has underpinned phenomenal economic progress and growth. The mechanism has created industrial relations harmony and is continuing to progress that harmony throughout not just the public service but the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I welcome the publication of the Estimates on education and I look forward to a more detailed debate on the issue at a later date.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_252" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_484">I listened with interest to Senators' contributions. Despite an offer to be relieved, I was pleased to remain for the full debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">A number of Senators raised the issue of the Stability and Growth Pact. Ireland supports the pact on the basis of sound public finances in the EU. The discipline which has resulted from the pact has been good for Europe and Ireland. Sound public finances are essential to underpin business confidence and investment to sustain economic growth. Clearly there are some adjustments to be made but, contrary to news reports in the wake of this week's meeting of Finance Ministers, the Stability and Growth Pact is alive and well. The rules of the pact exist for a good reason, which is to ensure a disciplined approach to the management of public finances across the EU and this discipline remains in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">On the decisions in respect of France and Germany, there is no difference in substance between the European Commission's position and the conclusions reached by the Council on what needs to be done to tackle the excessive deficits. The main issue discussed by Finance Ministers was essentially procedural and concerned the best way to proceed. While the Commission put forward its view, the majority of member states,  including Ireland, favoured proceeding on the basis of the Council conclusions. This was supported, particularly in view of the stated willingness of both France and Germany to adhere to these respective positions. The Commission's formal proposals are effectively in abeyance and may be reactivated in the future. The performance of both France and Germany will be closely monitored for adherence to the respective commitments undertaken by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Members raised the issue of stealth taxes and charges. The total value of additional charges, including motor tax increases, is estimated at €91 million. This represents 0.3% of the total gross provision of more than €40 billion. Some of the changes in eligibility conditions and social welfare payments arise from ongoing reviews of relevant schemes. These have been included for a reason. When the Minister announces the increases in social welfare benefits on budget day the situation will become much clearer.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">On the economic and budgetary strategy, it is clear that creating a low inflation environment, keeping public expenditure increases in line with resources, keeping debt levels low and planning a coherent investment strategy will reap rewards, not just in the long term but in a matter of years. This is a prudent policy. The Government's sensible economic and budgetary policies contributed in no small way to the achievement of unprecedented growth levels up to 2002, which will continue to ensure that the Irish economy performs comparatively well in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">On pay and public service numbers, Senator Higgins and others advocated that we breach the social partnership by not honouring the agreed terms of Sustaining Progress.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_491">He wanted us to breach it. He said we should not pay benchmarking, which would be a clear breach of Sustaining Progress. Partnership has served the country well over the years and the Government is committed to honouring its pay commitments, provided the conditions in the agreement are met. We cannot prejudge the outcome of the performance verification process, the first round of which is currently taking place. Public service pay accounts for approximately one third of all public spending. If we wish to attract good quality public servants we must pay rates reasonably comparable to the private sector. This is a fact of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Senator Norris criticised changes to supplementary welfare payments, particularly rent supplements. As in the case of other social welfare payments, the purpose of the SWA rent supplement is to meet income maintenance needs, not long-term housing needs. The Department of Social and Family Affairs indicated that particular care will be taken when implementing the measure to ensure the interests of vulnerable groups such as the homeless, the elderly and  people with a disability are fully protected. Local authorities have primary responsibility for meeting long-term housing needs. The provision in 2004 for local authority and social housing of €1.049 billion will allow for significant investment across a range of targeted measures which are important in terms of tackling poverty and social inclusion. The increase in the housing provision will allow for an increase in the local authority housing starts from 4,500 in 2003 to 5,000 in 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">Due to the consolidation of the progress gained to-date in the voluntary housing area, it is expected there will be a record output of approximately 1,700 units in 2003 and there will be an increase in the number of households that will benefit under the various affordable housing schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">A number of Senators raised the issue of infrastructure. Despite suggestions to the contrary, investment in infrastructure is running at historically high levels in recent years. The reality is that the Government has substantially increased the annual Exchequer capital provision since 1997. It has increased from €2 billion to €5.5 billion in 2004. We have maintained it at approximately 5% of GDP in recent years in order to give priority to addressing the infrastructural deficit. The different schemes announced are making substantial progress. Some of the major ones discussed here today are well ahead of budget contrary to many of the reports about the big national programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The Government's commitment to implementing its economic and social policy, as appropriate to prevailing economic circumstances and to the sound management of the public finances, will be to the benefit of people in the coming years. The 2004 Estimates provide for a gross expenditure of €40.4 billion. This is an overall increase of €1.9 billion or 5% on the forecast outturn for 2003. It is ahead of inflation which is currently running at 2.3%. Some 67% of this provision will be allocated to the key priorities of health, education and social welfare.</p>

          <p eId="para_499">That Seanad Éireann:</p>
          <p eId="para_500">notes a major review of the Government's development co-operation programme has just been completed by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, DAC;</p>
          <p eId="para_501">welcomes the OECD's endorsement of the Government's aid programme and recognises that the study's findings published on 20 November, constitute a strong endorsement of the programme and its underlying objectives by the internationally recognised arbiter of quality and standards in overseas development assistance;</p>
          <p eId="para_502">congratulates the Government on the outcome of this major international review of our development co-operation programme which highlights that a very positive judgment has been passed by Ireland's peers on our activities in the field of development co-operation;</p>
          <p eId="para_503">acknowledges that the aid programme is making a profound difference to the lives of some of the poorest people on earth and that Ireland has been praised by the international donor community for the quality, focus and effectiveness of its development co-operation activities;</p>
          <p eId="para_504">commends the Government for the commitment it has shown in increasing Ireland's ODA resources towards the UN target of 0.7% of GNP and the example we have set internationally;</p>
          <p eId="para_505">fully support the efforts of the Government to ensure wise investment of Irish taxpayers' money and to attain the highest international standards in terms of quality and impact in the developing world;</p>
          <p eId="para_506">emphasises the importance of the Irish Government continuing through its aid programme to transform the lives of very many extremely poor and vulnerable people, lifting them out of poverty and offering them hope and support;</p>
          <p eId="para_507">notes that this month €6.7 million in assistance was announced in response to natural and man-made disasters in some of the world's poorest countries; and</p>
          <p eId="para_508">maintains we can be justly proud of what is being achieved through the Development Cooperation Ireland programme on behalf of the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House. I am sure all sides will join me in complimenting him on the manner in which he has carried out his portfolio, specifically in the area of overseas development aid. In light of the Estimates published last week, we have maintained our contribution at a similar level of GNP as last year. I thought the Minister of State was unusually brave in stating publicly that the ambition of reaching 0.7% of GNP by 2007 may not now be achievable. I hope that in injecting a note of realism into the budget, he would agree that it should still be the main aspiration of this Administration to reach that figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Ireland is proud of its role in the area of over seas development aid. That role is traditional and is embedded in our psyche. It started with our missionaries going out to the African countries, in particular, building up much needed infrastructure and educating those among whom they moved. The State has taken on that role admirably. This is not a political issue with a capital "P", but one that finds universal support. We may quibble and criticise the level of support and, in some instances, the manner in which it is allocated. However, the general principle that Ireland has a proud record in this area and that it should strive to maintain that record is accepted by all sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I am particularly pleased that the report of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee published last week noted that in the past decade, Ireland's contribution to ODA has increased dramatically to 0.4% of its gross national income compared to a figure of some €70 million or .16% of gross national income in 1992. Ireland channels half of its ODA to the least developed countries. This is the largest share among the 22 member countries in the Development Assistance Committee and contributes to achieving the millennium development goals. It might be salutary to remind the House that those seven programme countries are Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique, Lesotho, and Timor Leste, formerly East Timor, with which Ireland has had a strong relationship both prior to and subsequent to independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I am sure the Minister of State will refer to Ireland's role in providing ODA to Uganda and the political implications of the decision taken last July to redirect some €10 million of the €30 million to non-governmental channels, which has put Uganda at the top of the list of ODA assistance from Ireland, and the subsequent political flurry of activity from that country with the visit of various Ministers whom I and other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign and Affairs met, as did the Minister, at the end of August. This culminated in the visit of Prime Minister Museveni some weeks ago who met with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and indulged in what might be described as a charm offensive to ensure the allegations made, primarily, although not exclusively, by John O'Shea of GOAL would be addressed. I am not sure the Ugandan Prime Minister or the Ministers in his cabinet adequately addressed them to the point where all of us were fully satisfied. The Minister may also have some lingering reservations about the role of Uganda in its near neighbour country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and of its military support for armies operating in that area acting as a proxy for Uganda. I am sure he will also be referring to that because Uganda tops the list in terms of the amount of ODA it receives from Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">We have a strong tradition of helping the poor and the dispossessed and the Government made a commitment in 2001 of at least $30 million annually, through Development Cooperation  Ireland, to fight HIV-AIDS by way of multilateral, global, regional, national and community efforts. In this context, the Minister of State and the Minister stated that one priority of the Irish Presidency would be to address the AIDS pandemic not only in Africa but also in the western Balkans and associated countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">It is interesting that the vast majority of people in Ireland support development efforts although I am sure the Minister of State will have something to say about a recent survey which showed most Irish people are not very clear about what we do in this area, how we do it and what countries benefit. There is obviously a need for better marketing of Ireland's undoubtedly distinguished role in this area to ensure that we continue to receive the support of the people as we continue to increase our ODA in years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I agree with the Development Assistance Committee recommendation that Ireland should now plan how it will manage and implement a €1 billion programme. This is what the figure will be if, as I hope, our ODA will be 0.7% of GDP by 2007. Further recommendations of the committee include focusing on the least developed countries, especially those in eastern Africa where our aid is concentrated; supporting selected multilateral agencies; continuing to respond to the HIV-AIDS crisis, which the Minister of State will focus on during the Presidency; and promoting Ireland's forward looking debt strategy. The committee also recommended that Ireland should reintroduce a multi-annual agreement on ODA allocations and further increase Development Cooperation Ireland's staff. The Minister of State should also note the recommendation that there should be more opportunities for a strong development focus in career patterns in the Department of Foreign Affairs, specifically in terms of ODA. He may have some comments on that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">I have no doubt that the Minister of State and other contributors will refer to the committee's report. I have outlined the good news, but the bad news concerns the rankings that appeared in <i>Foreign Policy</i> magazine, published in May-June 2003. It teamed up with the Center for Global Development to create the first annual CGD-FP commitment to development index, which grades 21 rich nations on whether their aid, trade, migration, investment, peacekeeping and environmental policies help or hurt poor nations. Ireland did not fare too well in the survey despite the fact that we have been increasing our budget over the past ten years. Ireland is in the bottom 25%, a disappointing joint 15th out of a total of 21.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">As I stated, the CGD-FP commitment to development index rates development aid under various categories rather than just focusing on overall financial allocations. For example, under "peacekeeping", we rank only 9th out of 21, despite our proud record in this area. Our score was less than half that of Greece. Admittedly, this is because Greece sent some 2,000 troops to the  Balkans, which was way in excess of what it would have been expected to send. If the scoring is to be conducted purely on the basis of numbers, as it was, it is a little unfair to Ireland considering the size of its Defence Forces and the number of personnel we are able to contribute. There was a suggestion that under-investment in terms of our Defence Forces may hurt us.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The trade score assesses the barriers imposed on goods from developing countries. We rank joint 17th in this category, ahead only of Japan, Switzerland and Norway, none of which is part of a major trading bloc. Has this anything to do with recent goings on in Cancun at the WTO and the fact – I say this with considerable justification – that Ireland will protect its small farmers in the transition period relating to the reform of the CAP? I compliment the Minister of State on stating in public in Cancun that he believed Ireland's moral obligation was to look after the welfare of the developing countries in the area of trade, free up trade barriers and reduce tariffs while at the same time acknowledging the need to protect small farmers in Ireland. I compliment him on his showing to the rest of the world that Ireland should not be seen to be grouped with those nations that would be prepared to sacrifice reductions in trade barriers for their own domestic reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The rankings in respect of the environment make sad reading. The CDI ranks each country's commitment to the environment in terms of the damage it causes to the global community and its commitment to international environmental initiatives. Sadly, Ireland comes second last, next only to the United States. We all know the position of President Bush's Administration on the Kyoto Protocol and international environmental initiatives, in respect of which it is pursuing a particular agenda with which most of us violently and vociferously disagree. Again, one has to look at how the rankings are produced. Will the Minister of State address this point? It is important, in the wider context of Ireland's continuing role in providing overseas development aid, that we take account of these other issues and realise it is not simply a matter of helping poorly developed countries by channelling aid into, for example, infrastructure or the types of activities in which we are very proudly involved in the priority countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I am glad there is recognition of countries other than the seven priority countries in Africa and that the Minister is considering an initiative in the Balkans, particularly in respect of AIDS. I hope he will also consider the wider economic difficulties particularly in Kosovo, Albania and many of the countries along the Black Sea. These difficulties could have a direct impact on us, particularly in the context of enlargement. Does the Minister of State know if there will be any widening of the priority country programme or will he concentrate exclusively on those countries that have been named? I accept that the development com mittee said the Government should focus on those countries and not take on more than it can cope with, but I raise the issue in the context of enlargement. If we continue to allow a deepening economic deprivation in certain Balkan countries, it will have a most serious impact on us in terms of illegal immigrants coming across our borders and of economic migrants. Is it not better to do in that region of Europe on our doorstep what we are attempting to do, and doing successfully, in the African countries?</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I commend the motion and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply. We are very proud of him. He has brought to his brief not only a breadth of vision and expertise, but also a very deep moral commitment to helping the less well-off in the world.</p>

        <speech by="#DonLydon" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Mr. Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_522">I second the motion and I too look forward to the Minister's speech. A sum of €399 million has been allocated for international co-operation under our aid budget for 2004. This represents the highest allocation ever and an increase of €25 million over that for 2003. There have been increases every year since 1997, when the allocation was just €117 million, but they have been significantly more substantial in recent years. The allocation has more than doubled since 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">This year's increased allocation will enable the Government to maintain official development assistance at 0.4% of GNP. In percentage terms, Ireland is now the seventh largest donor in the world and its average is well above that of the EU, which is 0.33%. When contributions from other Departments are factored in, total official development assistance next year should amount to some €480 million, the equivalent of 0.41% of GNP. This is a very substantial increase at a time when there are constraints on spending in so many Departments and it shows our continuing commitment to meeting the needs of the poorest of the poor in the developing world. More importantly, the quality of the Irish programme has been lauded internationally. The findings of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, published on 20 November last, constitute a strong endorsement of the Government's development co-operation programme and its underlying objectives by this internationally recognised arbiter of quality and standards in overseas development assistance. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said: "I warmly welcome the outcome of this major international review of our development co-operation programme. A very positive judgment has been passed by Ireland's peers on our activities in the field of development co-operation." He added: "This is a tribute to the vision and dedication of the Minister of State Tom Kitt, TD and the team he leads."</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Anybody looking at the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt's record over recent years can see that he is suited to his office. He has a particular interest in this field, to which he has applied himself diligently, and several Intergovernmental  Conferences and other groups have praised his work. This is not flattery; it is praise for work accomplished. When people do good work, they should be acknowledged. In this instance the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, works extremely hard, taking a particular interest in his brief, and he should be lauded.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The OECD endorsement is a tribute to the Government for the commitment it has shown to increasing Ireland's overseas development assistance resources towards the UN target of 0.7% GNP. With wise investment of Irish taxpayer's money, the Government has attained the highest international standards in terms of quality and impact in the developing world. Our development co-operation programme commands huge international respect, as this OECD peer review testifies. Through our programme we are, as Senator Mooney said, transforming the lives of many extremely poor and vulnerable people, lifting them out of poverty and offering them hope and support. We can be justly proud of what Development Cooperation Ireland is achieving on our behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">No matter how poor we think we are, we will never be satisfied with the amount of aid that we contribute because we are immensely rich compared to the poorest of the poor. Parts of the world are riven with disease, particularly AIDS which is spreading at the rate of wildfire, and we must at all times give everything we can to assisting other people who are less well off than us. We are probably doing the best we can. In our commitment to poverty reduction, we channel half of our overseas development assistance to least developed countries. This is the largest share among the 22 member countries in the OECD's Development Assistance Committee and contributes to achieving the millennium development goals. We maintain a long-standing focus on health and education and trying to combat the AIDS pandemic. A commitment in 2001 of at least $30 million annually to fight HIV and AIDS through multilateral, global, regional, national and community efforts supports Development Cooperation Ireland's mainstreaming of HIV and AIDS issues throughout the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The interesting feature of aid here, as has been seen many times when there were calls for help, is that most people support the giving of aid. We could almost say that if we raised the level a little, it would receive even more support. The public has never protested at giving more money to this area. When the Live Aid concert took place and whenever there was a call for help, the Irish people always responded with great generosity. I do not wish to criticise the Government which is doing a very good job, as is the Minister of State, but if we push the boat out on this issue, there will be no negative reaction. Many junior Ministers tend to look for a great deal of money for their Departments without much hope of success, but the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, would find very little resistance. If he pushes the door, it will open for him. He does that most of the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">It is important that we build up public awareness in this regard. Given the number of agencies seeking help, including Concern and Goal, we must have a public awareness initiative to say where and how money is spent and where it goes and so on. Perhaps some of it is dissipated. I have occasionally heard that moneys collected do not always arrive at their destination. Some goes in administrative costs and so on. Nevertheless, we are doing as well as we can under the circumstances, but we cannot rest on our laurels. We can always do better. I believe that we have a Minister of State who will continue to move the programme forward as best he can.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_529">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p eId="para_530">To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_531">"Seanad Éireann:</p>
          <p eId="para_532">– recognising the tremendous success of Ireland's Overseas Development Aid Programme;</p>
          <p eId="para_533">– noting the promise made by the Taoiseach to increase ODA to 0.7% of GNP by 2007;</p>
          <p eId="para_534">– condemns the Government for the failure to make any progress towards this target."</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I welcome the Minister of State. We all agree that he is doing a great job but he is not receiving the backing of the full Government. It is a fair reflection of the chaos in Fianna Fáil that it picks this item to show its strengths when all it is doing is stabilising a budget and reneging on a promise. That is the reality. In a few months we will assume the Presidency of the European Union and we will have a great opportunity to lead by example. The Taoiseach, as President of the European Union, could put pressure on other EU and non-EU countries, but instead we seem to be faltering or rowing back on a very clear commitment he gave on two occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">At the Millennium Summit in 2000, and recently at the UN General Assembly, he said that Ireland would move towards the figure of 0.7% of GNP in its funding for official development assistance. However, his actions seem to indicate differently because instead of increasing the rate as has been the case recently, we have stalled on last year's figure at 0.41% and we are not advancing towards 0.7%. Even the OECD is openly questioning the Government's commitment, asking how can it reach the target of 0.7% by stalling this year. Trócaire and other agencies have made it very clear that they feel the figure of 0.41% is very worrying. They would prefer that we move up to 0.48% in 2004, followed by 0.55% in 2005 and 0.62% in 2006, arriving at 0.7% in 2007. Instead we remain as we were last year without even an increase to allow for inflation. That is remarkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The Fine Gael amendment focuses on the  Taoiseach, his credibility and his ability to deliver on promises he made. We are very clear about our backing for the Government's action to date in this area, but we feel the level of funding should be increased and we should be working towards the figure of 0.7%. Like the various aid agencies, we are extremely worried when we see a Government putting the squeeze on funding for overseas development agencies as soon as there is an economic slowdown. It is amazing to see this Government's priorities when the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food can, in the space of two weeks, approve €14 million for an equestrian centre, with very little consultation, yet for major projects, whether school buildings, a radiotherapy unit for the south east or in this case overseas development agency work, there is a problem with funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Fine Gael is very proud of the record of the overseas development aid programmes and of the people involved in them, who have done Trojan work. We are proud of our record abroad in putting money into capital projects and ensuring that long-term problems are eradicated. As Senator Leyden noted, we have a fantastic record.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">However, we are very sceptical of the Government and its plans to deliver. We call on the Minister of State and the Fianna Fáil Members of the House to accept the Fine Gael amendment and honour the commitment given by the Taoiseach on two occasions that the Government is working towards 0.7% of GNP by 2007. The Government should, therefore, increase this year's funding to approximately 0.48%. That can still be done and we urge the Government to do it. It would restore the public's confidence in the Government and give the Minister of State the much-needed allocation which he can ensure will be spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I approve of the recent decision to suspend ODA funding for the Ugandan Government. That was correct. The President of Uganda has a few questions to answer. It is important that taxpayers' money does not go to a corrupt regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">This amendment is very simple. It reminds the Government of the promise it made and on which it now appears to be reneging, or faltering. We urge the Fianna Fáil Members of the House to accept the amendment so that the funding can be increased and we can reach the figure of 0.7% of GNP by 2007, as promised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_261">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_542">I second the amendment and I welcome the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">When I think of the old phrase "charity begins at home", I recognise that it has little meaning for the Government at home or abroad. We see again the hallmark of the Government, its broken promises, of which we have had a series since the general election of May 2002. The people were forced to swallow the bitter pill of a series of cutbacks which will affect the weakest and most vulnerable here at home, while there is evidence that  the funding cutbacks are also affecting underdeveloped countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">It is not surprising that there is no possible way the Government will reach the target referred to by Senator Browne of giving 0.7% of gross national product per annum in overseas aid. Having committed to reach this figure by 2007, the Government is now having to backtrack and admit that our overseas development aid contribution will remain at 0.41% of GNP.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Currently, the figure indicates that Ireland gives 41 cents in every €100 of gross national income to overseas aid. With the Taoiseach repeatedly promising that aid spending will reach 70 cent in every €100 by 2007, a major rethink on allocation would need to be effected.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">In what could be said to be the shedding of crocodile tears, the Taoiseach described the decline in global overseas development aid over the last decade as "shameful, indefensible and inconsistent". However, the Taoiseach's own record in relation to his own promises seems at odds with these emotional words. Actions save lives both at home and abroad while broken promises threaten the most vulnerable in Ireland and abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Two months after being re-elected in May last year, the Government cut overseas development aid by a staggering €32 million, an early indication of cuts and broken promises that have had such far-reaching effects on our disillusioned electorate. Every day we hear of people fed up and disappointed. In particular, we hear charitable organisations such as Focus Ireland, when it considers the numbers of homeless, Threshold and several other organisations strongly criticising the Government for its broken promises and the lies told in the run up to the last general election. They were told that everything was rosy in the Department of Finance and in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Globally, between 1990 and 2000, overseas development aid fell steadily from 0.33% of donor country GNP to 0.22%. This decline is at odds with the commitment to achieve the agreed target of 0.7% of developed countries' GNP to be transferred as overseas development aid. It has serious consequences for the least developed countries, who are dependent on such aid which provides nearly 90% of their long-term capital inflows. This will have very serious repercussions in those countries which need this funding. It is shameful for the Government to carry on in this way, reducing aid to Third World countries. What it is doing is evident and people have contacted me on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">For Ireland, the main priority now in relation to overseas development aid is an examination of the credibility of the Government's commitment to achieving 0.7% by 2007 and the feasibility of achieving this target. In this regard, it is imperative that the Government makes adequate and consistent budgetary provision for a steady increase in the overseas development aid-GNP ratio. OECD officials have expressed the view that Ireland's aid programme was being hindered  by a failure to set out programmed funding increases into the future. Ireland is seen as faltering in its progress towards reaching the UN target for overseas aid spending for 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">For a country that is ranked by the latest UN report as second last among developed countries in terms of poverty and inequality, as Senator Mooney noted, Ireland also needs dramatic changes to alter its own dismal national profile. The UN report emphasised the need for robust Government action in tackling persistent poverty and inequalities. The report states that for yet another year, Ireland has the greatest disparity of incomes in Europe and is a deeply unequal society. Along with its criticisms of the overseas aid issue, it points the finger of blame towards the Government which it says must not shirk from tackling poverty, social exclusion and deprivation at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Fr. Peter McVerry puts it somewhat more forcefully when he says that the poor in Ireland have been shown two fingers by the Government through its recently announced cutbacks in social welfare supports. He went on to say that the Estimates were the most disgusting thing he had seen for many years. These sentiments are very much shared by the people. Apart from their generous support for overseas aid, over three quarters of them believe that whatever the cost, housing should be provided for the homeless and in a statistic that augurs ill for the Government in the next general election, 63% believe that the housing crisis is caused by Government inaction. The programme, Homelessness, an Integrated Strategy, was launched to great fanfare in May 2002. It set out a comprehensive approach to solving the problem, which was of the Government's own making, by the end of this year. The most recent figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicate, however, that homelessness has increased nationally by 7% from 5,234 in 1999 to 5,581 in 2002. There are 48,000 households – 140,000 people – on housing waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The Government is a disgrace and I make no apology for saying this because the electorate is fed up. Its record at home and abroad is one of division between the haves and the have nots, as evidenced by the Minister for Finance's announcement of an event centre in his constituency that cost €15 million when there is poverty in our streets. The Government squandered the riches brought about by economic success and we are left to pick up the pieces. I appeal to the Minister of State to look after the less well-off in society here and abroad.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">There is no doubt, however, that we are making progress.

We will hold the EU Presidency for six months from January and he will have the opportunity to address Heads of other member states, tell them how well we are doing and hold Ireland up as an example.

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_276">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_569">I would like to discuss the parameters within which we view this issue. As an Independent Member, I am non-partisan and would like to encourage the Minister of State. He is a very good Minister, a very decent man, but like all Ministers he is fighting for a budget. This is an important one and I want him to carry back the message to the Government that he has the support of all sections of this House to reach the target of 0.7% of GNP. I have a different view from my Fianna Fáil colleagues about how that should be approached but we are united on the desirability of this goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The importance of the Minister of State's work is demonstrated by the report of the review group which sets out clearly that more than 1.2 billion people are struggling to survive and 24,000 people, the population of a good sized town in the midlands, are dying every day of hunger, approximately 75% of whom are children. That is what we are confronting and we should not play party politics with the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The review group also adumbrated a series of very wise principles – effectiveness, value for money, transparency and accountability. It also indicates that it is good procedure to use non-governmental organisations and missionary groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">I compliment the Minister of State on his initiative to form a public private partnership involving business and the energy of the financial community. It has a responsibility because it makes substantial profits and should be encouraged to contribute. I assume any money raised in this way, however, will not be counted towards the trend towards 0.7%.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_574">That is even better and I compliment the Minister of State on the idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">I take a different view from the Government on certain issues, such as Uganda. I heard President Museveni make a surprisingly good case when he was interviewed on the radio recently but he was interviewed in a mealy-mouthed fashion and let away with murder. He sowed some doubts in my mind about my feeling that there should be clear restrictions on Government aid to Uganda, but then in the last few days his wife and daughter flew to Paris to allow his  daughter to give birth there and he openly said that the health services were not good enough for his family. That is a disgrace and he should be ashamed to say such a thing and to spend $250,000 on a private aeroplane to take his wife and daughter to Paris.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">This raises the question of why we should give money to someone like this. We know the family is involved in exploitation and about its involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It exports mineral resources and diamonds that do not even exist in Uganda so where do they come from? There is no question that there is corruption in Uganda.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Other countries, such as Denmark and Holland, impose restrictions and have criteria for accountability and standards in public life. We implemented such restrictions against Sudan even though we knew in 1997 that people were in difficulty. It is a shame, however, to think of Irish taxpayers' money being handed over to people like them to squander.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">We have a good record in overseas development aid. When the current Government was elected six years ago, the overseas development aid budget was 0.31% of GNP and we were in tenth position in the league table. By 2002 we had overtaken France, Finland, Canada and Switzerland and we are seventh at 0.41%. That is certainly an honourable record but, unfortunately, it seems that we are now about to falter. It would be a pity if we were to lose our good position that has been steadily improving under various Governments. Also, the method of delivery and the efficiency of our aid is highly regarded. In terms of certain criteria, when compared to other donors, the level of tied aid in Ireland is 0% with the OECD average at 18%, the percentage allocated to the least developed countries by Ireland is 48% whereas the OECD average is only 22%. This aid does work. We have all heard heartrending stories from the coalface in countries like Liberia, Sudan and Ethiopia, about simple things like the digging of latrines undertaken under the supervision of Irish NGOs. These can have an enormous impact on the health and welfare of the people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Since 1960, we have noticed a tremendous improvement in terms of life expectancy increasing from 46 to 62 years. In underdeveloped countries the under-five mortality rate has been falling from 216 to 107 per thousand live births. There is a measurable, quantifiable result from the delivery of this aid, which is why it is a pity that it is stalled. I do not want to criticise the Minister of State; I know where his heart is in this programme. We should unite in this House to give him support in pushing as vigorously as possible to reach the outlined target. The Taoiseach said that we would reach 0.7% during the millennium, which was a good political photo opportunity. He said it again at the conference in Johannesburg a short time ago. He recommitted himself, but what is happening in the meantime? We are having a  freeze, which represents a real problem for a number of reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">It is not only people on this side of the House and partisan politicians who are concerned. The OECD, which has no axe to grind in terms of the party political structures of this country, has also commented. It states that the committee was concerned that what Ireland has been able to achieve over recent years might be lost by a failure to reach the volume of aid targeted. These comments come from Mr. Hunter McGill of the OECD and Oisín Coghlan of Christian Aid has made very similar points. The Estimates represent a missed opportunity to make progress towards the target.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">On the practical difficulties involved, even accepting that what the Taoiseach has said is correct and that the figures can be stalled only to make a sudden jump in the final year, this lacks credibility. I, for one, do not believe it. We will plead poverty again. We hear all these clichés about Ireland being the most generous country and that we give more <i>per capita</i> than most, and then we fail at this level. We cannot afford to fail. We need to give ourselves this position of moral leadership. We are coming into the leadership of the European Union, which is an opportunity to set an example.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I suggested there is something dangerous in this, even supposing that we were to accept what the Taoiseach said, that he would jump up the figures in the last year. There is an immense management challenge for the people administering this. If one starves an organisation of funds and suddenly dumps a load of money on it in the final year, one neglects that these processes should be allowed to be grown organically, allowing them to develop on a steady curve. Otherwise, one creates practical implementation difficulties for other people.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">What a moral dereliction this represents, knowing what we do about the poverty that exists. I come back to what I said at the beginning, some 24,000 people a day die of starvation. They cannot wait. It is cruel to expect them to wait for a sudden jump in the final year.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">More power to the Minister of State who has done a good job and has the support of this House, despite what might appear to be fractious voices. Every single person in this House will support him in going back to Government and trying his hardest, by the most vigorous methods, to make his colleagues understand how important is overseas development aid.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_279">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_585">I support the motion and welcome the Minister to the House. I compliment him on his drive and initiative in his ministry and in keeping the area of overseas aid to the fore.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I commend to the House the Government's decision to increase overseas aid again this year by €25 million, bringing it to €399 million. The people around the world who receive the benefit of our aid will be seeing real additional help from Ireland in the year ahead, and when contributions  from other Departments are factored in next year, we will spend some €480 million, equivalent to 0.14% of our GNP.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Some people see our aid budget as a luxury when spending is being controlled elsewhere. I believe it fits with the values and wishes of the Irish people. We are staying true to our commitment to helping the poorest people of the world. As a country, we will continue to be one of the leading donors of aid in the world in respect of our GNP. It is no harm to salute the contribution we have made. Ireland is seventh in the world as a donor, ahead of countries such as France, Britain and Finland. Our current level, as well as our commitment, well exceeds the EU target of 0.33% of GNP of each member state's aid budget, as agreed in Barcelona last year. Ireland's aid programme in the year ahead, has been targeted at almost €400 million. We continue to show a significant increase compared to where we were a few years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">In the context of the many calls on the public finances, we are giving priority to sustaining overseas aid. We must ensure that the real and positive outcomes for the world's poor, those of Africa in particular, are safeguarded in the budget. Our focus must be on the benefits for those we aim to help. Ultimately, this will be the measure of success in funding our aid programmes. There has been unprecedented growth. Five years ago, our contribution was €158 million; it is now €373 million and moving towards €400 million. As a nation, we should be proud of our record in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">It is no harm in debates like this to remind people of some basic facts, if for no other reason than to ensure we double our efforts to help the people concerned. Some 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day, 2.8 billion people live on less than $2 a day and 2.4 billion people lack the basic sanitation facilities we all enjoy. Some 11 million children under five die annually in developing countries, mostly from infectious diseases, while more than 100 million, including 60% of girls, do not have basic primary school education, facilities we enjoy.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The critical issues and principles that govern the development of a country are what we have to address. We must ensure our aid is well spent. That is the task that faces the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt. We must ensure we put the alleviation of poverty first, that we address people's basic needs and that we work in partnership with developing countries. We must work in partnership to educate and train people in sustaining themselves. We must target children to ensure the countries concerned are safeguarded in the future. We must link this issue to human and civil rights. We should also bear in mind, in a debate like this, that terrorism and its causes often stem from countries that lack basic needs and are underdeveloped. As well as dealing directly with terrorism, we must counter the breeding grounds of terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I salute our NGOs, missionaries and volunteers, who have represented this country so well during the years. Before we ever gave serious amounts of aid to these countries, the above groups were championing the cause in the name of this country. They have played a crucial role in providing aid, fostering public awareness about the crises in the countries concerned and ensuring financial support. We should also salute the Irish people who have given so generously over the years when asked. Were it not for their leadership role, we would not be making the contributions we are making today.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Greater public awareness of the depth and scope of our aid programme is required. There has to be public ownership of this whole area, a greater awareness in schools etc. I welcome the fact that a number of schools are now taking on summer visits to areas like Zambia, Brazil and various other countries as part of an educational programme for young people. We should wear this as a badge of honour and ensure we shore up our aid programme against future attacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">As regards comments about funding in Uganda, I urge the Minister of State not to abandon this programme, but to ensure it is directed at those in need. That is a huge responsibility, but we cannot abandon these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I ask the Minister of State to elaborate on the position regarding APSO and facilitating volunteers serving in aid programmes overseas. We must continue with programmes in which we are embedded and we cannot overstretch our resources. There is an onus on us to help countries to move on to the next level to ensure that they have political and economical stability. It is not good enough to do a small bit and then to move on. We must ensure we bring them from their current level to the next level before we consider expanding into other programmes. South Africa is recognised as the linchpin in the greater African Continent. We must ensure we play our part in bringing stability to South Africa in the hope that the entire region will benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">I hope we use the forthcoming Presidency of the EU to highlight our commitment to overseas development aid. I hope Ireland's solidarity with countries in need will be emulated by other EU countries. I wish the Minister of State well not only with his national responsibilities, but also with his international ones. I hope the advances we have made in recent years will continue to be made. The Minister of State has shown his dedication and commitment to the Ministry and he has done Ireland and the Government proud.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_596">I thank the Minister of State for coming here this evening. He has been in the House a number of times to discuss related issues. I wish to move the Labour Party amendment.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_597">The Senator cannot move her amendment at this stage, but she may speak to the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_598">I will speak to the Labour Party amendment. I also support the Fine Gael amendment, which is similar. The main point of the Labour Party amendment is that the Government is not keeping its targets for overseas development aid as a percentage of GNP. Unless the Government changes its policy and increases its aid for 2004, it is unlikely we will reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007. That is an issue of concern for the country and it should be condemned. The Minister of State was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> a week ago as having said that it will be difficult to reach the UN target and that he will have to give some consideration to the timeframe over the coming months. That is worrying. The Taoiseach committed himself to the UN target as recently as September and it was also part of Ireland's campaign to win a seat on the UN Security Council a few years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">There has not been any progression of the Government's target. It is the opposite of what Senator Ormonde said. There is no point trying to blame the NGOs, as Senator Ormonde seemed to do. This is part of the Government's stop-go approach to current public spending. That is a cynical approach which undoes the good done by the Government in its development aid programme. The momentum has been lost in terms of the implementation of the programme and the good work done by previous Governments is also being undone. The Government's credibility has been damaged by its failure to increase the percentage of aid. The level of aid should be at 0.48% for 2004 if the Government was committed to reaching its target.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">A number of speakers referred to the success of our programmes. That is recognised in the Labour Party amendment, OECD reports and the documentation many Senators received today from Trócaire. The OECD has stated that our aid is of a high standard. Senator Norris referred to the different indicators used to draw that conclusion. There are a couple of recommendations in the documentation I received from Trócaire today, including the fact that the levels should be increased in the budget to 0.48% of GNP for 2004 and that the Government should commit itself to incremental increases, as outlined by Senator Browne. Trócaire and the OECD recommend that we should have a multi-annual funding arrangement for ODA allocation. Trócaire recognises the value of that approach from 2000 to 2003 to enable strategic medium-term plans as the programme expands. I ask the Minister of State to respond to the recommendations by the OECD and by Trócaire in the documentation which was sent to Senators today.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Senator Norris was right that we all want to reach the targets. If we do not reach the targets, it will not damage the Government, but Ireland's credibility in the long term. World security will  also be affected because everyone gains when the levels of poverty are reduced in developing countries. More people will die if less is contributed by the Government than previously indicated.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_602">I thank the Seanad for arranging this debate and for inviting me to address the House. I have spent some time here during other debates. It was said by the Leader and others that this Chamber has its own unique character. I agree with that because such debates are conducted less acrimoniously and it is useful parliamentary work. I thank Members for the all-party support for increasing the budget, which I will speak about later.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The programme of assistance to developing countries has received a strongly favourable review from the member states of the OECD Development Assistance Committee. It took many hands over a considerable period to build the programme which drew many plaudits in Paris last week. On their behalf, I accept the favour implicit in this motion and I thank the Members for the strong support it demonstrates.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I welcome the opportunity to explain some of the elements of the programme which have attracted such a positive assessment. However, I agree that we must continue to do better and maintain a professional and effective approach. While the public may not know every detail of the official programme, there is evidence of strong support for the concept of providing assistance to poorer countries. Our own folk history of famine, the path-finding role of our missionaries and the current positive profile of NGOs have all created a public sense of understanding for the underdog in development terms, for those whose starting point, by virtue of disease, deprivation and history, is so far behind as to make the process of catching up all but impossible.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">As the DAC concluded last week in Paris, and as will be shown when its printed report appears next month, the Irish programme of development assistance is a strong one. Through its focus on capacity building and partnerships and its adherence to the best practices in development policy, the Irish programme, by the judgment of its peers, is strong and has a reputation for high quality aid. While aid includes responding compassionately to emergencies such as Liberia, for example, it is especially about addressing long term development needs, the slow building of the capacity which enables poorer countries to help themselves, and sustainable development.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The programme is an integral part of Irish foreign policy and is strong in policy and in implementation. Its components testify to the concentration on long term development. The bilateral programme focuses on just six countries in southern and eastern Africa and one in Asia, where we are a significant player in helping them to develop all aspects of their social and economic infrastructure, playing a role not unlike that which the EU played in our development. Our multilateral aid  assists UN agencies which play leading roles in development and agencies which deal with children, refugees, AIDS and other health issues, human rights, mine clearance, environmental degradation and women's issues. We have a well regarded programme of debt relief and, not least, we have a strong programme of assistance through NGOs which have developed outstanding international reputations and high profiles at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The issue of the quality of aid is crucial. Some 50 or more years since western countries began trying to bring about development, the fact that there is so little progress speaks for itself. The emphasis of the programme must be on quality to have any prospect of success and, moreover, it must be seen to have this focus. The review by the OECD has found that, as acknowledged earlier, Ireland channels half of its overseas development assistance to least developed countries. This is the largest share among the 22 member countries in the DAC and contributes to achieving the millennium development goals. The programme has a long-standing focus on health and education, which is now complemented by a major focus on HIV and AIDS. We have maintained a laudable concentrated focus on a select number of very poor countries in our bilateral programme and we have moved in recent years to establish a strategic partnership with NGOs.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">This high quality aid, which is at the heart of the Irish programme and to which the OECD peer review is testament, took years of patient work to build. A real working partnership with a developing country begins with building an understanding of its people's reality and getting beneath the skin of the daily challenges. A social worker in Dublin or an aid worker in Africa will tell one of the slow, patient work needed to move beyond the barriers of low self-esteem which are common in any environment of poverty. It is also slow work to break down the assumption that outside know-how is better and to reach a common understanding of needs and the tentative beginning of genuine partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">In the bilateral programme, all our engagements are driven by three year country strategies. The same three year process applies to NGOs and multilateral agencies. In each case those strategies are preceded by significant evaluation to assess the value of the engagement, identify lessons and adjust the engagement to take them into account. Most importantly, in the case of our programme countries it is not Ireland which is in the driving seat but the authorities in those countries. Hard experience has shown that if we do not create a sense of ownership, a sense that it is the country's development priorities which apply, there will be no sustainable progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Our strategy is summed up in the old adage of helping people to do things for themselves. Progressively, over the years, we have moved away from donor-owned projects to working in partnership to support self-sustaining development within poor countries. The key requirement in  terms of effectiveness is to work with partner countries to create an enabling environment. Our own recent experience of development has shown the central requirement of creating the conditions to promote the growth of indigenous industry and the promotion of exports and inward investment. A key part of our approach is to work with partner countries to create such an environment. Time permitting, I will deal later with the issue of trade, which was rightly referred to by Senator Mooney and others. Lastly, we do not work alone. As mentioned, we work with partner governments; we also avail of the huge capacity and experience of the UN agencies and we work with international, Irish and local NGOs. Together, this represents a wide alliance for a war on poverty on a broad front.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">To fuel that war we need resources. Our funding this year and next year will be the highest in our history. This year our overall official development assistance stands at €450 million, taking account of other Departments. This may be compared to a little over €40 million a decade ago. Next year there will be an increase of €25 million to almost €480 million, as mentioned by Senator Ormonde. Given the constraints on our public finances, it must be acknowledged that the development programme continues to enjoy prominence among the Government's priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">As Senators know, we are committed to reaching the United Nations aid target of 0.7% of GNP. Obviously the slowdown in economic growth and its impact on tax revenues has affected all Government services, including the aid programme, which this year will remain at 0.41% of GNP. I acknowledge that it will be difficult to maintain momentum, but the commitment stands, and as the tightness in public finances eases with the growth of the economy, I will be pressing to re-establish momentum. I thank Senators for their support in this matter. I work in partnership with NGOs and the cross-party support I have received tonight is appreciated. It must be acknowledged that the debate on this occasion was tough for everybody who wanted to increase his or her budget. We have seen from the debate in the last week on other domestic and political issues that there are pressures everywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The multi-annual arrangement is the preferred option and it is extremely useful to have such a recommendation made here. We all know that would be the best way of doing things. In the short time allowed to me it is not possible to give a detailed outline of the whole programme. Instead I will dwell on the issue of HIV and AIDS, which merits huge attention. It will be a central development issue in our EU Presidency and has been referred to by a number of Senators. As the world enters the third decade of the AIDS epidemic, which has rightly been called a pandemic, the evidence of its impact is compelling. Dozens of countries are already in the grip of the disease and many more are threatened by  it. More than 3 million lives were lost to AIDS last year and 5 million people acquired the human immune deficiency virus, bringing to 42 million the number of people living with the virus around the world. Over the next decade, without effective treatment and care, they will join the ranks of the 20 million who have already died of AIDS. Enabling those who have not yet acquired the virus to protect themselves against HIV, and providing adequate and affordable treatment and care to people living with the virus, represent two of the biggest challenges we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">In sub-Saharan Africa, the worst affected region, 29 million people are living with the virus. A few years ago, malaria and a host of tropical diseases were the main cause of premature death. That has changed; AIDS is now the main killer. The threat is worsening. In this area approximately 3.5 million new infections occurred in 2002, while the epidemic claimed the lives of an estimated 2.4 million Africans in the past year. Women now outnumber men among people living with the disease, and a chilling statistic in terms of future vulnerability and likely social problems is that 11 million children have lost one or both parents to the disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I struggle in trying to bring the scale of the tragedy home to people in Ireland. Perhaps the best way to make sense of it is to go back to a device we used in our advertising campaign leading up to World AIDS Day last year, in which we asked people to imagine that every week the population of a town in Ireland would be obliterated. Senator Norris mentioned this earlier. Another analogy is our own experience of famine and the degree to which it has seared our history and put its mark on much that has happened since. Imagine the impact in centuries to come of a tragedy on this scale and our failure to stop it.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">What is the impact of the disease on development in terms of the strong Irish programme I have outlined? It is clear from the statistics I just mentioned that all gains in development are in danger of being undermined by this corrosive threat. The most potent evidence of its impact is the reduction of life expectancy in the continent by more than ten years. Other gains in the area of education and literacy have been seriously undermined. The impact of HIV and AIDS is most severely felt by the poor – effectively those who are disempowered – and particularly by vulnerable groups such as women, children and the elderly. Young women in particular are at risk, both biologically and socially. Women are more vulnerable to HIV infection due to less secure employment, lower incomes, less access to formal social security, fewer entitlement to assets and savings and little power to negotiate sex. They are more likely to be poorly educated and have uncertain access to land, credit and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">In addition, the impact of AIDS on food supplies particularly affects women and children. Women contribute over 50% of food production in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia and typically carry out the labour intensive elements of farm ing. Women are responsible for subsistence production, food storage, food preparation and water collection. The recurrent food crisis in southern Africa highlights how vulnerable many countries are to shocks that disrupt food production and consumption. The prevalence rates of HIV are, not surprisingly, high in those countries most affected by food shortages and range from 15% in Malawi to 33% in Swaziland.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">One of the most disturbing aspects of the epidemic is its impact on children. More than 14 million children currently under the age of 15, most of them in Africa, have lost one or both parents to AIDS. By 2010 this number is expected to jump to more than 25 million. With infection rates still rising and adults continuing to succumb to the disease, HIV-AIDS will continue to undermine progress in the protection of children and cause large-scale suffering among the most vulnerable for years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">As acknowledged by the OECD in its review, Development Cooperation Ireland has a strong policy commitment to addressing the challenge HIV-AIDS presents to the achievements of the millennium development goals. Its policy direction is clearly outlined in its strategy, A HIV-AIDS Strategy for the Ireland Aid Programme. This strategy outlines the direction of our contribution to the prevention of HIV-AIDS infection as well as the mitigation of its impact on development. To accomplish this aim we are giving greater prominence to HIV-AIDS throughout the organisation, including the re-orientation of the programme and the training of staff to be responsive to the epidemic. Increased financial support is being directed to international and national efforts to combat the epidemic and to promoting greater policy coherence between international and bilateral initiatives. In addition, we are supporting specific programmes that have proven to be effective in alleviating the impact of the epidemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The year 2001 was one in which the international community demonstrated an increasing commitment to address the problems of HIV-AIDS. A declaration of commitment was agreed following the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV-AIDS in June 2001. Members will recall the Taoiseach made a commitment at that session that Ireland will spend an additional €50 million per year on HIV-AIDS programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Over the last three years the volume of funds we have committed to HIV-AIDS has increased tenfold. In 2002 alone, over €40 million was spent on HIV-AIDS programmes with a similar budget for 2003. Our global response to HIV-AIDS comprises advocating for a sustained and resourced response to the disease, strengthening leadership at all levels and improving co-ordination of resources. The Irish programme provides funding to UNAIDS. Members will be aware that we have been heavily involved with the Clinton Foundation in providing additional funds. Ireland does not just make commitments – we honour  them. Ireland has taken a holistic approach and does not simply provide treatment, we also provide for care and prevention. Much of our work is now concentrated in Mozambique.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">In 2002, DCI launched a new regional initiative designed to complement HIV-AIDS activities in countries already benefiting from Irish support. The programme supports activities in a number of key areas, including prevention to promote behaviour change; home based care and orphan care; countering stigma and discrimination of those living with HIV-AIDS; and operational research around specific areas and issues. We are involved in this in all our programme countries and embassies in those countries have been asked to ensure they build the treatment of HIV-AIDS into their programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The primary impact of HIV-AIDS is borne by families and communities. Given the limited resources of government, non-governmental organisations and faith-based organisations often bear the primary responsibility for delivering home based care and support to orphans and vulnerable children. In 2002 the Irish programme established the HIV-AIDS partnership scheme and this continues to work well.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">HIV-AIDS continues to be the biggest single obstacle to reducing poverty and to attaining the Millennium development goals. To fight it, so many things must work together, including strong leadership, allocation of adequate resources, co-ordination of planning and promoting a best practice approach. Monday next is World AIDS Day and we intend to highlight the issue as we did last year. We are organising a major conference on this issue during our Presidency. This conference will relate the problems caused by HIV-AIDS in central and eastern Europe and central Asia. The head of UNAIDS has spoken about the need to urgently address the problem in that part of the world. As Europeans, it is important that we do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Senator Mooney referred to the CDI index. This essentially refers to coherence and seeks to ensure there is coherence between our policies on peacekeeping, environment and development. This area is close to my heart and there is progress to report in it. In going to Cancun for the World Trade Organisation talks, I initiated a process between my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Michael Ahern, headed the trade delegation. I was involved as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid as was the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. It is important that we have coherence between Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The distorting effect of subsidies emerged at Cancun. We have made progress since the index assessment was carried out and changed our policies during the mid-term review of the CAP. This ensures the issue of subsidies has been disconnected from production. I consider this to be a key development and I warmly welcome it. We  recently held a forum on agriculture where, for the first time, there was an exchange between farming organisations and NGOs. Prior to the talks in Cancun, I had made a suggestion that such an exchange should take place. I met a representative group of NGOs yesterday and members of it told me the dialogue is continuing. This is the first time NGOs are getting the opportunity to debate these issues with farming representatives. This is a tremendous development as, with the decoupling of production and subsidies, there will be common ground between those that represent the least developed countries and organisations that represent Irish farmers in disadvantaged areas. I am referring to the west, in particular, an area about which I know something. There is a common ground in the need to look after the less well off both at home and abroad and this provides good prospects for cohesion.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">As regards peacekeeping, we must acknowledge that the index was probably measured following our disengagement from Lebanon. Ireland has sent 430 troops to Liberia and they will be in place before the end of the year. Having visited the country I am conscious that this is a mission not without risk. Liberia gives Ireland a huge opportunity to play its part, and not just in peacekeeping. I am convinced that we can do much work on development and human rights and carry out humanitarian works. A number of Irish NGOs are already active in the country. I intend to ensure we bring cohesion between those elements during our Presidency. While it will be a difficult job, it is one we will rise to and we have the capacity to do it. I accept that more work must be done in the area of the environment. Ireland has made commitments on climate change and we will be raising this issue during the Presidency. We need to do more work in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The trade engaged in by the least developed countries to which I have referred constitutes 0.5% of world trade. Those countries earn eight times more from trade than they receive in overseas development aid. This makes clear to me that while ODA is vital – I will do my utmost to keep the graph continuing in the right direction – trade is an issue that must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">We have carried out some work in this area, such as the CAP reform. We have also had the TRIPS agreement, an important trade issue regarding access to affordable medicines. Since taking up this position we have put much of our resources into capacity building for these countries. Agencies like the IDA and Enterprise Ireland help our companies to trade. We want to give similar supports to these countries to help them to trade. Senator Norris referred to the private sector forum I am establishing. I believe this to be an exciting opportunity to give Irish companies the chance to trade and share their skills and management know-how with similar companies in the developing world. The idea is to establish partnerships with similar companies,  mentoring and exchanging personnel, expertise and technical assistance. There is much we can do. I assure the House this will not be part of the ODA budget; it is a separate initiative from which we can derive many benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Senator Ormonde mentioned NGO accountability. We have strong reporting systems with NGOs. She raised an important point. There is charities legislation on the Statute Book which does not come under my ministerial responsibilities. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. We should be bringing in that legislation as soon as possible and I will investigate the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The issue of communication was mentioned by many Members. We need to find ways to improve our message and that is something we are working on. I am anxious that Members from both Houses of the Oireachtas should be involved in seeing what is going on abroad. I have taken the initiative on that front. Members from this House will be involved quite soon. That will come into next year's programme. It is important that we build up the development community out there. I was asked about the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, by Senator Minihan. The question is timely because I am pursuing a modernisation programme on three fronts. I mentioned the private sector: an ICT task force is reporting to me in the next week and that will provide new opportunities to help many of these countries on the new technology front. We will come back to that. As regards the volunteers, APSO is being integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs. We now have an opportunity to progress the whole approach to volunteers and to modernise it.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">In early December, I will announce a major initiative on volunteers. During the Special Olympics we saw the tremendous support that exists for voluntarism in Ireland. I believe this can be replicated internationally. We know what is happening in many parts of Ireland, with even young students going abroad to help out in the developing world. Universities are involved and I want to expand the volunteer agenda. We have a tradition of trained people going abroad for periods, and in many cases they have gone for a year or two. We should give people the opportunity to go abroad for a number of months. There are many fantastic young graduates who are keen to go abroad to try to play their part. We have been in touch with the relevant organisations for some months and an interesting initiative will be announced shortly. I am keen to build up a new generation of development practitioners, so to speak. This is quite exciting and I hope we will have Members' support.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">On Uganda, I again thank the Seanad for contributing to this debate and for Members' understanding of the complexities of the situation. I have been to Uganda and have seen the high quality work that has been done with taxpayers' money. It includes the work on long roads that  NGOs would not be able to build. The idea that NGOs or missionaries can do what we are doing is a myth. It is about bringing water to villages. I have been there when the taps were turned on and seen the impact on the most deprived and disadvantaged communities. I have seen the schools and the training colleges where Irish taxpayers' money is going. I assure the House that the money is being well spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">There are major political issues with which we need to deal and we are engaged with those. I have met President Museveni twice, when he visited Ireland and at a meeting in Tokyo not long ago. We went through all the issues regarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I would suggest that not just Ireland but the Dutch, the British and all of us who were present in the capital, Kampala, through our embassies have managed to exert influence and leverage on this government to do certain things. The obvious one was to withdraw from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That has happened. There are issues of governance that we need to address. We are in there dealing with building up the police and the judicial system. This is a complex issue. It comes right to the heart of development and how we operate as a nation. Do we walk away from the kind of issues I mentioned earlier? That is a key point. I would find it hard to do that, but if that is what the Oireachtas wants, we will have to think about it. As we debate this issue today, I am satisfied, on balance, that the work we are doing is very valuable to the ordinary people who are detached from the political considerations and have nothing to do with these areas of controversy. I am satisfied we should be with them, as many Members have said.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The question of political issues is one of those subjects that has caused much public debate. This is good because it has brought the issues into the public domain. We will stay with Uganda, but we are not uncritical. We are also in there changing policies also as regards how the government is run. There are issues down the line that we need to address such as the development of a multi-party state and other matters. The bottom line is we have a good programme. It has won support in this House tonight. We are not standing still and are undertaking some interesting new initiatives, thanks to a growing budget.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_636">The Minister of State certainly has a supporter in me, as he knows. My admiration for the incredible work of the staff of Development Cooperation Ireland is no secret. The Minister of State and DCI staff probably regret more than any of us the fact that more progress is not being made towards the 0.7% of GNP target. That is what everyone wants. We might be wiser to get the Taoiseach to lower his sights somewhat and concede that if we are not going to be on target, we could at least make it 0.5% or 0.6% or something like that. That could be a comfort to us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I will start with where the Minister of State left off and say that I have been to Uganda too and I  know the concerns people have. It is all very well imposing democracy and one's way of life on a country, but as the Minister of State rightly said we have given people ownership of these programmes. We are there as partners with them, not to tell them what to do. All the efforts I saw being made in Uganda were absolutely excellent. One meets people in various parts of Africa who seem to posses the right calibre for running the whole country and then a few weeks later one discovers that they have been dismissed on some terrible charge. That happens here, too. Those sort of things happen. It is as well not to be too self-righteous about politicians in other countries because there can be problems, as we know only too well.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">That Irish aid is not tied makes me very proud. I have been particularly struck in other countries, not just Uganda, by the fact that we buy local produce. This is hugely important because it means those who produce the products there are encouraged to produce more as they know there will be a market. If, on the other hand, one does as the United States does, and sends in unwanted grain or surplus wheat, that is not nearly as valuable. While our monetary effort may not have gone up that much, the quality of what we are doing there is important. To send wheat to an area where it is not normally eaten and where there are no mills for it, having refused to mill it before it is sent, is a hard-hearted way to behave. The way we deliver aid, I believe, is extraordinarily good. The Minister of State is a great supporter, as I am, of the multilateral organisations, the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA and the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF. These organisations are incredibly important in providing the best forms of treatment that are available in the multilateral state. Their ability to influence governments is also important. Ours is only one voice but these organisations have a big voice in influencing governments on how to bring forward various programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">I was particularly struck by the Minister's comments about AIDS. This is the most appalling problem at present. Education is required, not just in literacy and numeracy but also about sex. There is a serious problem with regard to preventing the spread of AIDS. I attended the conference organised by the Minister of State about a month ago which was held in Iveagh House. I was not there for the entire day but for a large part of it. Some of the talks were profoundly depressing. Some of those who work in Africa said the window of opportunity to get the message across to school children about how AIDS is spread is getting progressively shorter. The age of infection is decreasing in many African countries because it is now better known that the younger the girl with whom a man has sex, the less likely she is to be infected.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">When I was promoting adolescent sexual rights, people did not think I was doing so to encourage adolescents to have sex. I was trying  to promote the concept that they should be given an understanding that they were not obliged to have sex with older people. This is a big problem in Africa. The Minister will have been told by people in Africa about the sugar daddies and so forth who approach schoolgirls and tell them they will pay for their uniforms, their school fees etc., if they will have sex with them. This, unfortunately, is how the infection is spread. Unless women in these countries are somehow shown that they have the power to say "no" to sex and the traditional practices which are extremely dangerous and must be changed, we will face an uphill task.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I am glad the Minister of State is supporting the microbicides initiative, particularly in view of the fact that the latest vaccine trials have failed and the next ones will not be held until 2007. This is most disappointing. I am not an expert on vaccinations but because the HIV virus can mutate so easily, I believed it would be particularly difficult to produce a vaccine for it. They tried to produce the vaccine with the DNA core but the latest results are disappointing. Some of my colleagues who work in the field of HIV infection are not enthusiastic about microbicides but that might just be in Europe. Things are different in Africa. I have little experience of meeting people in this field in Asia, eastern Europe or Russia.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">It gives the woman some power. Even if it was only 50% effective, it would make a big difference. The problem with condoms is that the woman must persuade the man to wear them. There is a supply of only five condoms per man in sub-Saharan Africa per year. One can see, therefore, that the situation is a little gloomy for a girl seeking some protection. I strongly support the microbicides initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Ireland did good work on the TRIPS agreement and I am delighted that retroviral drugs are now being made available. The development of resistant strains is a worry but we will have to cross that bridge when we come to it. When I spoke to people in Uganda, Zambia and other countries about white cell counts and the sophisticated treatments we carry out in this country, they thought I was half mad. I probably was even to mention them but we must try to supply as much as we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Senator Minihan said earlier that we should try to address the reason that certain countries have problems with terrorism, which is putting a terrible burden on many administrations. At the end of the Anglican memorial service in Istanbul for those who had died in the bombing, Canon Ian Sherwood, who is my constituent, said we badly need to address the issues that cause people to act in this way. We should try to do that through the various aid programmes in which we are involved.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LabhrasOMurchu" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_645">I have been following this debate carefully. On both sides of the House there is a great feeling of pride in the tradition that exists in Ireland of helping less fortunate  countries. In many ways that is the result of our history of deprivation. We always highlighted the aid we received, even if it was limited, and we appreciated it. It helped us to survive and gave us the opportunity to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">All the relevant statistics were mentioned in the course of the debate. However, they are a little clinical and sometimes overshadow the fact that what we are talking about is human suffering. In a way we are lucky that we are reminded of that suffering every day, particularly through television programmes. There is a terrible sense of frustration. It is easy to put a few euro in an envelope occasionally and send it to an agency but we know that it is a much bigger problem. We should not underestimate what is being done by the Irish aid agencies. The Minister has complimented them, as he has done on many previous occasions, and so have many Members of the House. They have been heroic and are living up to the dictum that it is better to light a candle than curse the darkness.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">There is an element of that in the criticism of the work the Government is doing. The Government is not cursing the darkness but is also lighting a candle. It wants to help. I have spoken to and read articles by people who have travelled to these countries, including Uganda. They have seen the health clinics, the primary schools and the rural roads built by Irish aid. There is tangible proof.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Kevin Myers wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> last July about Irish overseas aid, corruption and so forth. It was a sad piece of journalism. It was certainly a case of cursing the darkness but, even worse, what he said in the column was quite vulgar. He concluded by saying that he would not give money to African countries. It is easy to have a nightcap, go to bed, sleep and forget about them. I do not like that. It is unfair journalism and it is not acting in a humanitarian way. It involves making cheap jibes.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Everybody knows there is corruption in Uganda but even the World Bank has acknowledged that there has been a significant improvement there. If the Government does not interact with the governments in these countries, they will not be able to develop further. People might have looked at Ireland and said that the aid coming to this country during its worst days was sufficient in itself but we know it was not. It is necessary to have an infrastructure. I have already acknowledged the heroic work being done by the NGOs but even with the best will in the world it is not public service. The only way to deliver is by ensuring that there is a public service in place. If there is corruption in Uganda, it is being exposed by the Ugandans through a vibrant press, an active civil society and lively parliamentary debates. Anybody who studies the situation there will see that it is the Ugandans who are exposing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">It would be sad if the people who are doing this work in Uganda did not have the support and help of other sovereign governments. It is particularly important to acknowledge the courage of  what this Government is doing in its programme. There is a risk factor involved. Everyone can joke about Idi Amin, the wealth he had and so on. Senator Norris referred to the trips abroad. Of course this type of corruption exists. However, we must consider the people within the country who are trying to change this. The countries who have developed over the years started off with the worst excesses and then heroic people within that society tried to change things. The last thing these people want is to be ignored or isolated and for the west to move on to some other agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I fully respect the views of Members on the other side of the House. This is an issue on which we should develop a united front. While there is no political kudos to be gained from human suffering of this kind, there is a lot of political risk involved. If money is taken out of the Exchequer to fund overseas development aid there will be less money for something else. We are all aware of the risks but luckily our tradition is to give a little to those who are less fortunate. Because of the work Irish people have done, particularly the missionaries and other volunteers who work abroad, there is a lot of goodwill for Ireland. Given the trust in the Irish position, Ireland is often seen as an honest broker or intermediary. If we were to desert people who are expecting help from us, we would not be doing any good for those who are suffering in these countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">We are all pleased to be able to say that Ireland's contribution is improving all the time. I applaud the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, because it is quite evident that he has not gone in for histrionics today. He has been very calm about the issue and committed in what he has done. One can sense his compassion, which reflects the views of the Government and society. We should stick to the present programme we have. Certainly we should co-operate with the NGOs, but I do not think Kevin Myers will fill a single bowl for a single person in Africa as a result of what he wrote last July.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_286">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_653">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I do not doubt his sincerity or commitment in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Two annual reports were published yesterday, one by the food and agricultural organisation based in Rome and the other by the UN AIDS organisation, which made depressing reading. The food and agricultural report stated that the percentage of the world population afflicted by chronic hunger or infected with the HIV-AIDS virus has risen to record proportions and that 842 million people in the world are suffering from hunger. The UN AIDS organisation reported that more than 40 million people around the world, including 2.5 million children, are infected with AIDS and that up to 3 million people died last year from AIDS. The Rome-based food and agricultural organisation called for an international alliance against hunger. I hope during our Presidency of the EU we will be to the forefront in leading this alliance against hunger. I hope the  Minister of State will adopt a personal role in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Ireland has a proud record of overseas aid. The Irish people support the giving of aid to countries ravaged by famine, AIDS, war and a myriad of other problems. In this context, I cannot understand the Government's decision to stall aid at 0.41% of GNP. The OECD expressed concern that Ireland is faltering in its progress, which is regrettable. It was stated by several people, including the Minister of State, that the Taoiseach gave a commitment that we would set a target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007. He has repeated this on several occasions. I hope it is not another promise that will be reneged on.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">As stated by Senator Lydon, there is overwhelming public support for the aid programme. I urge the Minister of State to make his voice heard among his colleagues in Cabinet. I do not doubt his bona fides but I am sceptical of the Government's commitment to honour its target based on the stalling of it this year. In summary, there is a need for a commitment to annual incremental increases up to 2007. As Senator Henry said, people should be informed if we do not reach the 0.7% target. If the Government and the Taoiseach believe it is not a realistic target they should set another target. They should be honest and upfront because there are no political points to be scored on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I wish the Minister of State every success in the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_658">I compliment the Minister of State on his Department's achievement and on his personal involvement in this area. I also pay tribute to his predecessor who made an important contribution at a time when overseas aid was going through a critical period and questions were being asked about whether it was the right way to undertake the work. There has been some evidence that despite the investment which has been made, life expectancy is deteriorating, food shortages are more acute now than they were when the aid programmes began and overall it may be time to consider whether the policies being followed not just by Ireland, but by the international community, are best suited to the present crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I was particularly impressed with the Minister of State's intervention earlier when he indicated his wish to see trade issues being taken more into account. When I was Minister of State in that office I had an opportunity to meet with some of the leaders in the poorest countries in Africa such as Tanzania. The point was being made constantly by the political leaders that it would be better if they had access to markets for produce such as bananas, cocoa and coffee which would solve a lot of their problems. These people are not all crooks and gangsters, some are reasonably decent guys.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">I fully endorse what the Minister of State said about visiting Africa and seeing the situation at first hand. No amount of literature, videos or film can accurately portray the current problems in  Africa. When I took up office, people involved in the aid programme suggested that I should visit these areas. I was not too convinced at the beginning but after visiting the area I recognised that one must see the problems on the ground to understand fully the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Most of our aid budget has been spent in sub-Saharan Africa and only approximately 2% is spent in South America. I ask the Minister to pay attention to South America and particularly to areas such as Rio where the problems are enormous and where many Irish people work diligently to solve the problems.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_288">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_662">All that is left for me to do is to reflect on behalf of the House on the comments made by the Minister of State and, perhaps, make one or two final points. I am pleased the Minister of State has, with his usual clarity, acknowledged that we still have much to do. I welcome his commitment to coherence and the initiatives he is taking in that regard especially in light of the CDI report.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Ireland can be justly proud of the amount of money it puts into overseas development aid, but there are serious underlying difficulties about our other areas of activity, in terms of the environment, peacekeeping – I am glad he clarified that issue – and trade. We should be justifiably proud that we do not tie contractual obligations to overseas aid as do other countries. I wish to put that in perspective in case it may be seen as not being important. Rich countries send more than $50 billion a year in grants and low interest loans to poor nations. Normally these aid programmes are compared <i>via</i> crude sums of dollars disbursed or by total aid as a percentage of gross domestic product. However, there is tied aid to that, for example, the Canadian and Italian Governments may grant loans to a poor nation for highway construction but then require the recipient nation to hire a Canadian or Italian contractor to build the road, thus preventing the aid recipient from getting the best deal. In 2001, roughly two thirds of total international aid flows was tied. In the late 1990s,  the US agency for international development reassured the US Congress that almost 80% of the agency's resources went to purchase US goods and services. That is a disgraceful statistic. The CDI aid ranking also subtracts interest payments that donor nations receive on prior loans, equivalent to about $4.7 billion in 2001. That is an indication of the underlying issues. It is not simply a matter of providing money, it is about how the money is channelled and how it is spent and Ireland has a proud record in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">I should mention, since Senator Daly has expertise in the context of South America, that the top ten recipients of gross ODA from Ireland include, in tenth place, the Palestinian administrative areas. I make a plea to the Minister that if ever there was a case for improving aid to a people who have been oppressed, suppressed and living in the most abject poverty in the refugee camps in the West Bank it is these because I have been there. As Senator Daly said, no amount of videos can convey the misery under which people live. In the context of overseas development aid I ask the Minister of State to consider increasing aid to the Palestinian administrative areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The Minister of State's speech at the 2003 Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis encapsulates the ethos behind Ireland's role and proud record in this area. He said:</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Our objective of lifting the poor out of poverty will not be achieved unless human rights are placed at the centre of development. Ireland's programme of development co-operation emphasises the importance of human rights, of supporting defenders of human rights in countries such as Burma, of promoting free and fair elections throughout Africa, of ensuring that Governments govern for their people and not for the self selected few.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I also support the efforts of the United Nations to negotiate an international convention on the rights of people with disabilities and I am determined that we continue to play a central role in this area. That is humanitarian aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">I commend the motion to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_685">Several potato growers in my area, County Kilkenny, have brought to my attention the possible disaster that could occur if the potato disease, ring rot, were to arrive on our shores. The farm in Wales where the disease broke out has been exporting seed potatoes to Ireland for five years. I ask the Department of Agriculture and Food to investigate farms which have received seed potatoes from that farm. What measures is the Department taking to ensure that the disease does not enter this country because it has the potential to do to the potato industry what foot and mouth disease did to the livestock industry? I urge the Department to do something as soon as possible before it is too late.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_686">Potato production in Ireland is now predominantly a specialist farm activity, in which approximately 650 growers engage. Some 150 producers account for almost three quarters of the national production of approximately half a million tonnes of potatoes per annum. These were valued last year at approximately €96 million at farm gate level. In common with all agricultural commodities, potatoes are an internationally traded product and there are, accordingly, imports and exports, mainly for processing and seed. The need for vigilance in maintaining the high plant health status of the national potato crop is therefore of paramount importance. Ring rot is a serious bacterial disease, but is confined to potatoes and is not airborne. It does not affect humans, animals or other crops. It has affected potatoes in North America and was first detected in Europe in 1907. It was a major problem particularly in Scandinavia but good cultural practices, eradication and preventive measures, coupled with seed certification, have been effective in controlling it.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">While the disease has now been reported in most EU member states, except Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Luxembourg, it occurs at low levels in these countries. Measures to detect, eradicate and prevent the spread of the pathogen, have been set down in a EU Council directive, which is applicable in all member states. This directive is complementary and additional to directives on the marketing of seed potatoes. The planting of infected seed and poor crop rotation pose the greatest risk of the introduction and spread of ring rot. All member states, including those which have remained disease free, must undertake an annual survey to establish the status of the disease. My Department is responsible for these surveys and last year 600 samples were taken across the whole potato supply chain, including imports from the European Union and third countries. The sampling regime is based on risk analysis and to date all samples which have been analysed by the State laboratory, have proved negative.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Member states may take additional measures in regard to planting material. Ireland has already availed of this option. The current problem is not considered as warranting further measures which would disrupt trade. Ireland produces most of its own seed needs and only the highest grades of imported seed can be marketed here. Scotland is the main source of imported seed and like Ireland, is considered a high grade seed production area within the European Union. Importing potatoes for consumption has been a feature of the Irish trade for over 25 years. As I have indicated, these imports are also subject to sampling for ring rot and other pathogens, and last year samples from ten different countries were taken, all of which showed negative results. It is also a requirement under EU and national regulations that all potatoes sold here are identified or labelled to allow trace-back through the production chain. This is a very important factor in the event of a disease outbreak.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Recently, a single infection of ring rot on one farm has been confirmed in the United Kingdom. This triggered a review of our measures which have proved adequate to date. We will continue to monitor the situation closely in consultation with the UK authorities. A joint review of strategies to combat the risk of infection is also under way, between our Department and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland. All commercial growers, with the co-operation of the IFA, are being asked individually to identify their source of seed to supplement existing information for risk assessment for this disease. Some re-orientation of the existing controls, with an increase in inspection levels, follow-up sampling and testing, is also being undertaken. Growers and traders are being advised on the precautions which they should take to reduce the risk of an outbreak and spread of the disease. Such measures include good rotation and hygiene and the purchase of seed from reliable sources. Traders should ensure that there is proper labelling and documentation and deal only in quality potato products, at all times. My Department has taken all of the necessary precautions and measures to deal with this threat to our potato industry but we will continue to keep the situation under constant review.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_690">My specific point is that this infected farm has been selling seed to this country for five years, according to the growers to whom I have spoken. If the Minister of State cannot answer my question now perhaps he could do so later. The farmer has records of those to whom he has sold seed potatoes. We need to do everything we can to keep the disease out. The Minister of State's answer is satisfactory but is anything being done to trace the destination of product from this farm and to elicit whether there will be any infection or disease here as result of the seed bought in therefrom?</p>

          <p eId="para_691">We are very satisfied that the measures in place are adequate to protect the potato crop here, and imported potatoes. However, our potato inspectorate is monitoring the situation and taking into account the information that is available. Any further necessary measures will be taken.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Unsolicited E-mail.</heading>
        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_692">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to speak on this issue which is daily increasing in importance. I compliment the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on his recent initiative, which has received the support of our EU neighbours, to outlaw and eliminate spam. A study by the US research organisation, Pew Internet, has found that unsolicited e-mail or spam is beginning to have a detrimental effect on e-mail use. It has led most people to distrust e-mails. For example, 75% of e-mail users are upset that they cannot stop the flow of spam while 70% say that spam has made being on-line unpleasant and annoying and 30% are concerned that their filtering devices may block incoming mail that is important to them. However, on the other side of the argument, 7% of respondents in the United States, a figure which represents roughly 8 million people, reported that they have ordered a product or service offered in an unsolicited e-mail. Moreover, one third of e-mail users say they have clicked on a link in an unsolicited commercial e-mail to get more information. Thus, given the low overheads attached to spam, a percentage such as this indicates that it is more than worthwhile for "spammers" to keep sending bulk mail.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Junk or spam e-mail costs Irish business, without filtering protection, some €2 billion per annum, according to estimates from IE Internet. Spam accounts for 95% of some workers' e-mails while 12% of junk mail causes viruses, 13% of e-mails received by Irish business users are spam and 98% of those unsolicited e-mails are generated out of the country. The survey adds that small businesses can expect at least ten to 12 spams a day, some receiving up to 50. US data also show that unsolicited e-mails cost on average $1,500 per employee, per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">When I first raised this issue on the Order of Business some weeks ago I said I was receiving between 50 and 75 unsolicited e-mails a day. The waste of time is what affects business but the depraved nature of many of these unsolicited e-mails is also worrying. As I said, 98% are generated in the United States. If one separates those which offer mortgages at US interest rates and other American products, most are pornographic in nature. I have a young family and must restrict access to the Internet.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">In an ever-changing world of growing immorality, with violence and sex of the most graphic kind on television at the touch of a button, material which is also available now on Playstation software which is unregistered in this country and does not have to be submitted to the censor, we have a responsibility as parents to ensure children are allowed their innocence. Spam and unsolicited e-mail of this kind is totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">I am pleased to inform the House that over the weekend, the US Senate and House of Representatives have finally decided to grapple with this issue. Their law states that spammers will be barred from disguising their identity by using a false return address or misleading subject line. The harvesting of addresses from websites will be barred, e-mails must include a mechanism for recipients to opt out of future e-mails and the technique of sending millions of messages to randomly generated addresses will be banned. The law also prohibits the use of misleading subject lines, but a comprehensive solution must combine strong laws and enforcement with industry co-operation, technological innovation and the empowerment of informed sources. Microsoft and other providers, including America Online, British Telecom, Comcast, EarthLink and Yahoo are working together to shut down spammers who use deceptive tactics to circumvent filters or avoid detection.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">However, every e-mail user can take steps to fight spam. The first step is to make sure one has activated the spam filters built into most e-mail programmes. One should never reply to spam or unsolicited e-mails, even to unsubscribe, unless one is sure the sender is legitimate. That was how I was the architect of my own downfall. Some two years ago, when I began receiving spam on my personal computer, I was given the message that it was a certain company's policy not to send unsolicited e-mails, and that if I wished to be taken off its list, I should click "unsubscribe". After I had done this on about 25 spam messages, my brother, who works in the computer industry, told me that all I had done was to alert the spammers that my e-mail address was an active one.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">I plead with the Minister of State that in his reply he would, in the context of the initiative being adopted here, convey to the general public the measures that can be taken to minimise not just this annoying and irritating aspect of modern life, but the very dangerous dimension I outlined earlier. People should be cautious about giving out their primary e-mail addresses, review the privacy policies of websites when signing up for online services and report junk e-mail to the originating Internet service provider.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Despite the initiative taken by the US Congress, the law has been widely criticised as being flawed. Industry lobbying prompted legislators to create a single set of rules for e-mail advertisements, solicited and unsolicited. E-mail messages from fly by night operations selling herbal impotence remedies are not differentiated from those sent by airlines selling plane tickets to a pre-existing customer base. Messages from both would have to include legitimate e-mail addresses and a method for recipients to opt out. Herbal impotence remedies incidentally constitute a large proportion of the unsolicited e-mails I get, and for those uninitiated in impotence remedies, I am talking about Viagra in all its shapes and forms. Thank God I do not need it yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">California seems to have the right model, and it might well be looked at. California requires companies to have consumers' consent before sending commercial e-mails. However, the federal law passed last weekend in the US Congress overrides State law, and is already causing a conflict between State and federal rights. Debra Bowen, a Democrat and State Senator from California, who is a proponent of her State's anti-spam Bill, has said the Bill in Congress does not can spam, but legalises it. The Bill is full of loopholes, difficult to enforce and weaker than many state laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">If we are to grapple with this, there is a need for a cohesive and unified approach. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has already started that particular initiative by ensuring that within the European Union, sending spam is now illegal, but as I said earlier, 98% of spam is being generated outside Ireland and indeed outside the EU – it is coming from America.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">There are only some 200 identified spammers generating these millions of unsolicited e-mails. What they will do, and have already started to do, is to go offshore. They are going to Canada, to the emerging countries of eastern Europe and to China. There is a need, which I hope the Minister will address, for international co-ordination on this issue. It is not sufficient to look at the European Union. We must talk to the Americans but also to those in other parts of the world, especially Australia. If we can get international co-ordination, a legislative framework that is supported and enforced by the industry and the major countries, we will set the benchmark for other countries now being seen as the recipients.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">As a result of the US law and the EU initiative, we will focus on the origins and the source of these e-mails. We will not be able to eliminate them, but we can go a long way towards damaging them. I hope the Minister's initiative will be fully supported in the European Union and at a more international level.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_704">On 6 November last my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, signed into force the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services, Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 2003. These regulations transpose Directive 2002/58/EC, which regulates the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. They introduce restrictions on direct marketing making use of communications networks. Restrictions on unsolicited direct marketing by telephone, fax, automated calling systems, e-mail, SMS and MMS are provided for. Most notably, the regulations also introduce a ban on spam originating in the EU. Spam, unsolicited e-mail marketing sent to individuals, is, with a limited exception covering existing customer relationships, only allowed with prior consent. This opt-in regime equally covers SMS messages and other electronic messages sent to any mobile and fixed terminal. Some protections against unsolicited commercial e-mails to businesses are also provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">The regulations provide for penalties of up to €3,000 for each unsolicited e-mail, SMS or MMS sent in breach of the regulations. The Minister is also considering the creation of indictable offences and consequential additional penalties to further enhance protections for both consumers and business.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">It is important to realise that many administrations worldwide do not have legislation regulating spam. While efforts to achieve international co-operation on measures to combat the proliferation of spam are at an early stage, there are encouraging signs that co-ordinated action will be achievable. I understand that this week the United States Senate approved a Bill, to which Senator Mooney has alluded, to outlaw most spam. Australia and South Korea have also recently reached agreement on measures to combat spam. There is now an increasing awareness among administrations and business that global co-operation is necessary to address the specific threat posed to online business and consumer activity by spam.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">We are not convinced that it is desirable for Ireland to attempt to address such matters in isolation. We believe that Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the European Union offers an excellent opportunity to further progress international co-operation and effective enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">We consider that a mix of various instruments will be needed, including legislation, filtering techniques, self-regulation, commercial contracts and international co-operation. Initially, the primary objective of international co-operation is to promote the adoption of effective legislation in third countries and subsequently to co-operate with these countries to ensure effective enforcement of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">At the multilateral level, we believe that active participation is necessary in fora such as the OECD, where work on spam has started. Indeed the European Commission will host an OECD workshop on spam in February of next year, intended to contribute to a better understanding of the problem created by spam and its possible solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">At the UN level, the Commission has also raised the issue of spam in the context of the forthcoming world summit on the information society to be held in Geneva for 10 -12 December this year in order to promote awareness and international co-operation on this issue. While there is some scope for the promotion of bilateral co-operation with third countries, a more efficient approach and response can be delivered through international fora, for example the OECD and the world summit on the information society, and through their bilateral meetings and discussions, for example at ASEM, NAFTA and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">EU provisions relating to spam apply to both PC and mobile phone messages. My advice to consumers is to be aware while on-line and to ensure the bona fides of companies and individuals with whom they are in contact. People should only give an e-mail address to people and sites they trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The most effective way to ensure an e-mail box does not become cluttered with junk mail is for a person to keep his or her e-mail address private. To do this, the person should only give his e-mail address to people he knows and to sites that explicitly say they will not share e-mail addresses with third parties in their privacy policy. Always check that an Internet site has a specific privacy policy or provides guarantees as to how they use personal data. If an e-mail address is necessary for Internet services which a person suspects may send a vast amount of e-mails or share the address with third parties, it may be a good idea to set-up a separate e-mail address for use exclusively with this type of service. People should use e-mail filtering tools – there are many e-mail packages and stand alone programs that possess the ability to filter out unwanted e-mails. The method by which this is accomplished varies between programs but techniques such as blocking certain addresses or keywords are applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I agree with Senator Mooney that we all need to be aware, particularly those of us who are parents. There can be serious consequences for young people who are accessing the Internet unsupervised and are receiving spam from across the world. This is an important issue and the Senator has done a good job in highlighting it. The Government is determined to deal with it and we hope to use the Presidency of the EU to achieve international co-operation to address this issue across the world.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Capitation Grants.</heading>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_301">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_717">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I have called on the Minister for Education and Science to outline the plans in place to increase the capitation grant to voluntary secondary schools to meet the cost of insurance. I have raised this issue because I have been contacted by the management of the Catholic Secondary Schools Association and by my local secondary school, Loreto College, Letterkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">This issue is specific to voluntary and private schools and does not include comprehensive or vocational schools. There are problems with the insurance industry across the board but it is now affecting schools. Between 1997 and 2002, insurance costs rose from €24,500 to €35,000 for a school with 533 pupils, an increase of 45%. Voluntary and private schools are being treated differently even though they were given a commitment following the publication of the Blackstock report that stated that insurance payments should be made to voluntary secondary schools to compensate for the State funding of principal insurance costs of comprehensive and community schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">The Minister of Education and Science admitted in 2001 that there is a major gap to be bridged but that gap still exists today. It is inappropriate that a secondary school in Letterkenny has to reduce heating and lighting and cut back on essential services to students and on essential purchases as a result of the lack of a capitation grant towards insurance. The schools are seeking €50 per pupil to go towards the increase in insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">I hope the response I get is specific to the matter – capitation grants to voluntary schools for insurance costs – and not the usual script written by a civil servant that tells how much money has been spent across the country. The Minister of State has a script and will do his best to be specific but I do not want a recital of the Government's achievements since 1997 because such scripts make a mockery of Adjournment debates. It would be better if debates were specific to the question.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">I am delighted to be here with Senator McHugh, a very bright young man, and I remind him that we cannot hear good news often enough. The Government must tell the facts often enough so he can tell his constituents about our success and the progress we are making.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_304">
          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_723">The funding arrangements for our schools, including the arrangements made for insurance cover, have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. By its nature, this evolution has generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion. In the case of voluntary secondary schools, which are privately owned, responsibility for obtaining insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools. The only circumstances, therefore, in which the Department would take specific responsibility for the insurance is where ownership is transferred to the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The Minister and his predecessor have already shown their commitment by the introduction of enhanced equalisation funding measures for voluntary secondary schools. In addition to the <i>per capita</i> grant of €25 that was introduced under the school services support initiative for second level schools in September 2000, and which now stands at €99, secondary schools have benefited from a further increase of €28, bringing the grant for such schools to €127 since January. From €25 to €127 in a few short years is unbelievable progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">This <i>per capita</i> grant was in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to €15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to additional equalisation funding of almost €30,000 per annum and overall additional support services funding of approximately €80,000 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">A further measure of the Minister's continuing commitment in this regard is his announcement in the context of the 2004 Estimates that the support services grant of €127 per pupil is being further increased in the case of voluntary secondary schools to €131, a <i>per capita</i> increase of €4. This increase is in addition to the increase that the Minister also announced for 2004 that will bring the standard <i>per capita</i> grant to €274.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that since 1997, a secondary school with 500 pupils will receive extra annual funding of up to €105,000 per annum and annual grants of up to €240,000, or €260,000 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is preferable to putting in place grants for specific initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Minister is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. I spent a number of years dealing with that myself. I set up the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which made 67 recommendations to the Government that are now being implemented by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">In this context, the Minister has announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the Irish insurance market. The Government considers that these measures constitute a programme that is capable of delivering real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, is conscious of the concerns relating to insurance costs raised by the managerial authorities for voluntary secondary schools. He is committed to improving further the funding position of schools and to addressing the issue of equity raised by the voluntary secondary school sector. At a time of increased financial constraints, the recent announcement of further significant increases in the funding of voluntary secondary schools is a clear demonstration of both the Minister's and the Government's commitment to prioritising available resources to address the needs of schools.

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_731">Níl mé an-sásta. There is something amiss here. Last October, I received a letter from representatives of all voluntary and Catholic schools, while last November, I also received a letter from a secondary school. The Minister of State digressed when he referred to what he described as the unbelievable increases in funding to this area since 1997. The voluntary schools seek an increase of €50 per pupil, yet an increase of only €4 per pupil has been provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">I urge the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Education and Science to contact the voluntary schools sector. Its representatives would not write to me if they were satisfied with current funding arrangements. There is a problem here and a breakdown in communication. It is of paramount importance, therefore, that the matter be addressed.
