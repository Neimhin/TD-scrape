#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	0	We are worse off than we were yesterday.  What is at stake is the liquidity and independence of the Irish banking system and our country's finances.  Yesterday's news did not do us any good; we are worse off politically and economically than when we asked questions in the House yesterday.When the Taoiseach was elected, I respected and believed his call that he would work hard and make his decisions in the interests of the Irish public.  The Irish public is not being served by what is happening now, nor is Ireland's interest.  The Government that the Taoiseach leads has been far too timid about the situation in our financial institutions.  The finger can be pointed at the Government for a lack of oversight, real regulation and activity as our country edges ever nearer to further economic depression.  The Green Party — whose Ministers are not in the Chamber again this morning — will bleat in the distance for resignations and action, but the posteriors of its Ministers are super glued to their seats at Cabinet.Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach when he was informed of the transactions between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life & Permanent.  I asked him if he was aware that any member of the Cabinet in any way encouraged, was associated with, or supported that activity.  The Taoiseach did not answer that question.  On 29 September, when the Taoiseach discussed the offloading of shares in respect of the Quinn position, was he not aware how this would be financed?  Did he ask questions about this?  The Taoiseach is aware that section 60 of the Companies Act 1963 makes it illegal to transfer shares in this manner, except in certain circumstances.  Does the Taoiseach agree there was a fraud perpetrated on the Irish Stock Exchange?When did the Taoiseach find out about these transactions?  Was any member of his Government in any way associated with this?  Why did the Taoiseach not ask questions about how the transaction in respect of Mr. Quinn was to be financed?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I reject the Deputy's contention.  I also reject the idea that he does not wish to impugn my integrity when he has been putting out statements that impugn my integrity.  I would rather Deputy Kenny desisted from that sort of hypocrisy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I will withdraw any remark about the Taoiseach's personal integrity.  I would never do that and never have in my 33 years in politics.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Deputy Kenny did it as recently as last night, never mind his 32 years in politics.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	6	He gets others to do it for him.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	7	When did I impugn the personal integrity of the Taoiseach?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	8	He did it last night.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It has more to do with confidence.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Taoiseach should explain his statement or withdraw it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The briefing he gave suggested I am protecting people, and I do not even know who they are.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I gave no briefing to anybody.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Deputy Kenny put his point and now I will put my point.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I challenge the Taoiseach on where I impugned his personal integrity.  The Taoiseach should explain it or withdraw it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I will make my points.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	16	When did I impugn the personal integrity of the Taoiseach?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The position is——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	18	He will not answer that question either.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I have answered that question.  It was a preliminary remark, and I want to get to the heart of the matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Exactly.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	21	What is suggested in the briefing by Deputy Kenny and his people is that I am protecting someone.  I am not protecting anyone but the Irish taxpayer and the Irish national interest.  That is my sole concern.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I have never impugned the integrity of the Taoiseach.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I hold no brief for anyone other than those people because they are the people I serve.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Taoiseach is incompetent and asleep at the wheel.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I have never impugned the integrity of the Taoiseach, nor any member of his Government, unlike the Taoiseach.  He should deal with the issue.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Taoiseach should read the relevant line.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Deputy Kenny is at it all the time.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Deputy Kenny can be listened to in silence but I cannot be listened to in silence, is that it?
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Deputies O'Dea and Ahern spoke out.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	30	One of the points raised by the Deputy was whether the Ministers in the Taoiseach's Cabinet entourage supported a €300 million deal with select golden circle customers of Anglo Irish Bank.  We were not involved with this, it was an internal bank matter.  It had nothing to do with members of Government or any parties in the Government.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	31	The Government rushed in to save the banks.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I am entitled to reply to the question, Deputy Durkan.  Of course, the old tactic is that if one throws enough muck some of it might stick.  That is one of the reasons Fine Gael is so often on that rather than this side of the House.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	33	If the Taoiseach is lucky, he is heading this way fast.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Allow the Taoiseach to finish.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	35	He is finished.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	36	It is the old tactic.  I want to make it clear to Deputy Kenny that every decision taken by this Government in respect of trying to handle a difficult financial crisis has been in the interest of the taxpayer and in the public interest, and in the interest of no one else.  The Deputy asked about 29 September but there was no discussion on 29 September on those matters.  What was being discussed at that time was the fact that we were facing the possible collapse of the Irish financial and banking system unless the Government was prepared to provide a guarantee to that system.  That is what we did.  In doing so we provided greater stability to the system.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	37	What did the Government know in July?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I have made it abundantly clear that far from seeking to protect anybody, which is the nice juvenile conspiracy theory the Opposition has been going around with for the last three weeks——
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	40	We will tell the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	41	That is way over the top.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	42	It is not over the top.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Come on.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	44	One can take so much of that nonsense.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	46	This Government has been seeking to——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I did not interrupt the Deputy.  As a result of the due diligence undertaken on behalf of the Department of Finance, questions were referred to the Financial Regulator, which are now being investigated by the statutory authorities concerned.  This suggestion of protection——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	49	The Financial Regulator could investigate itself.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	50	——is totally baseless.  It is wrong, contemptuous and has no basis in fact.  It is a political slur and smear campaign——
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Hear, hear.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Hear, hear.  Those are the facts.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	53	——in an effort for the Opposition to capitalise on difficulties that currently exist——
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	54	That is rubbish.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	55	That is due diligence all right.  The Government would not recognise it anyway.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	56	——in the financial system to see if it can get some cynical political advantage.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	58	That is precisely the game the Opposition is involved in.  Let me tell the Irish people what I am trying to do.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The Taoiseach is apparently the standing judge.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I am trying to achieve two things.  I am trying to ensure the principle of accountability applies for anybody involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever, in this bank or any other.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	61	It is about time.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The Government has failed in that anyway.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The Taoiseach should read the files.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The only way in which that principle of accountability can be achieved is to respect due process.  The one way to ensure that people with far more resources than the Deputy or I can avoid accountability is by not respecting due process.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Taoiseach's predecessor spoke with some passion too.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	66	It is fundamental to trying to get to the bottom of this problem.  One of the ways we can ensure confidence in our system, externally as well as internally, is to confirm that those who have the independent statutory authority to investigate these matters are doing so.  As far as I and the Government are concerned, recognising their independence, they cannot come to a conclusion soon enough.  Whatever facts must be dealt with or whatever further processes must be instigated can then be initiated.  Let us be clear that this is the motivation of Government in respect of that matter.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20429	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Government is asleep at the wheel.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	71	——in terms of the leadership that must be displayed in the country and this House, it is true to say that our financial system, like others, is under continual stress.  The credit crunch and the ability to access markets and credit remains a challenge facing this system now more than ever.  I hold absolutely no brief for anyone who would besmirch the reputation or integrity of Irish banking domestically or internationally because of the difficulties it brings, exacerbating an already difficult position.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Those are the two principles upon which we are seeking to deal with these matters.  There is no other motivation or reason.  I reject with contempt any suggestion that I am in the business of seeking to protect anybody or do something in that respect.  It is really about the Opposition seeking political advantage.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	74	There are sins of omission as well as commission.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The charges being made by the Taoiseach are beneath his office but typical of him.  It is not the first time he has rejected questions, comments and proposals with contempt.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	77	That came from the Deputy's press office.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	78	It is not the first time the Taoiseach has descended into casting aspersions on other people's judgment capacity.  I am glad the Taoiseach has accepted that I did not impugn his personal integrity.  I will follow up with some of the questions he did not answer.When the Taoiseach was told of the Quinn shareholding being sorted out, did he not ask why it was so?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	79	And how?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Is it not a fact that the Government was in possession of information two months before it was prepared to put €1.5 billion into Anglo Irish Bank, when one could certainly say there was fraudulent activity going on?  The Government was quite prepared to put €1.5 billion of taxpayers' money into it.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Hear, hear.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The Government knew about this when discussions were taking place.  The Taoiseach might confirm the report that the transaction of the €300 million — not to a golden circle but a toxic circle — was overseen by a British finance house.  Is that true?  If that was the case, was the Financial Regulator and Central Bank in possession of all the information in determining whether the transaction was legal?I do not know any of these people and the Taoiseach has told me he does not know any of them either.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Does the Deputy accept that?

The Taoiseach is in a position to do something and send out a message both nationally and internationally that a change of direction is taking place in Irish banking and financial institutions, in which we now have no trust or confidence.Who made the decision not to pursue the ten members of the so-called golden circle?  Is the Government not going to go after these people?  I listened to the chairperson of the Green Party this morning on the radio.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, came in to speak about nationalisation of the bank, he referred to the concealment of loans to directors, the scale of those loans and the damage done to the reputation of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish banking in general.  We were told the Government would go after those loans to balance those books.

The Government states one thing with regard to nationalisation, while in possession of those facts, yet it does not act.Was this transaction overseen by a British finance house?  Was the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and, therefore, the Government fully informed as to what was going on?  Who made the decision and why has a decision been made not to pursue the ten persons in respect of the €300 million overhang from Quinn?  What action will the Government take to send out a message internationally that this country is a good place to do business and banking?The Government cannot do this unless it shifts persons in the boards and management structure.  There are good people in all our banks.  It is nothing personal but the message is all wrong.  The Taoiseach is in office but not in charge.

Nothing could be further from the truth; the Cabinet made no such decision and it is not our business to make such a decision.  We have nationalised a bank, which is now in the ownership of the people, so it can pursue, to the greatest extent it possibly can, all liability and debts due to it.  That was the purpose of nationalising it.If it were the case that we had not nationalised the bank and if the loss of market confidence was such that it could not maintain its deposits and it went into default, the taxpayer would have had to pick up the tab.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The reason we have nationalised the bank is to ensure the bank functions and we retrieve whatever debts are due to it to the greatest possible extent in respect of any transaction in the bank.  We made it clear that the management and board of the bank will do so according to normal banking practice.  They will not be interfered with on a day to day basis by this or any other Government that would have enough sense to know how that should proceed.  That is another canard that has been thrown out as part of the rumour machine we must contend with.I have made the point clearly that in respect of the proposed recapitalisation at the time, in the statement we made on 23 December, on Anglo Irish Bank we were talking about taking a 75% stake in the bank to provide capital of up to €1.5 billion to it.  Upon deciding that, with the loss of market confidence being such and the governance issues that were arising, we said we would have to nationalise the bank because there was no market confidence in its ability to continue under those structures.  We nationalised the bank; we have not put money into it yet but we stand ready to support it.That is the decision we made and it is at great variance with the suggestion we made about the recapitalisation of the other two banks at that time, a €2 billion capital injection plus €1 billion underwriting that would be supported by the Government in return for a 25% share if the private capital was not raised.  It is a totally different transaction, taking into account the very different situation for Anglo Irish Bank compared to the other two main banks.The Minister for Finance has indicated that we regard regulatory reform as a priority and that we must proceed with it to change the structure, how we provide regulation and its type.  That is a challenge not only for this jurisdiction, but for every jurisdiction that must face this financial crisis.  This is not unique to Ireland, although I am not suggesting in any way that is a factor.  We must ensure, on the basis of the facts before us, that we have a new regulatory regime.On this question of the transaction undertaken by these individuals to help to unwind the CFDs that had been built up in the Quinn stake in the bank, the issues that are arising now on that arose because of a due diligence undertaken, I again emphasise, by people acting on behalf of Government.  If the contention now is being made that in some way we nationalised a bank to protect people——

Has he found out who the ten are since?  When will he find out and when will he tell us?  We must be told because the people own this bank and we are stuck with the €300 million they gambled recklessly.  The golden circle must be named.The Taoiseach made an interesting statement yesterday.  He told us that he, the Department of Finance, when he was Minister, and the regulator became of aware of what he called the "overhang" of the Quinn interest in Anglo Irish Bank in March 2008 and that they concluded it was a source of instability in the bank.  That overhang was assembled by the Quinn group using a method known as contracts for difference, an arrangement whereby the person does not buy the shares, he or she effectively gambles on them, buying an interest in whether they go up or down.  Why would someone use contracts for difference to acquire an interest in a bank or other body rather than buying the shares?  One reason is that contracts for difference have a different tax treatment from the purchase of shares.  Stamp duty is payable on shares whereas contracts for difference are not liable for stamp duty.The Revenue Commissioners rumbled this back in 2006.  On St. Patrick's Day 2006, the Revenue Commissioners issued a compliance notice to the effect that contracts for difference would have to be subject to stamp duty.  Within days, the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, caused the Revenue Commissioners to reverse that decision and to withdraw the compliance notice.  He did so after being lobbied.  We know he was lobbied because in reply to questions from Deputy Burton and Deputy Rabbitte shortly after that, he acknowledged that he was lobbied.  The day after the compliance notice was withdrawn, the shares in Anglo Irish Bank increased by €0.30 and 3.7 million shares in Anglo Irish Bank were traded.Will the Taoiseach tell the House who lobbied him in March 2006, causing him to direct the Revenue Commissioners to withdraw the compliance notice days after it had issued?  This caused a situation to continue whereby trading in contracts for difference without tax liability continued, resulting in the overhang of Quinn shares in Anglo Irish Bank, among other things, which has now led to what the Taoiseach referred to yesterday as the instability in Anglo Irish Bank and all of the consequences that have flown with it, with the disastrous results for our banking system and economy.

That is my general recollection of 2006 but I will get the details and supply them.  There is no mystery to this.On the question of obtaining names, I have made the point — others can say differently if they wish —  that the matter is currently being investigated by the Office of Corporate Enforcement and the regulator.  It relates to a commercial deal done internally in a bank between the bank and its customers or investors.  I do not have the details of that transaction.  The independent statutory authority, acting independently, is dealing with that.  If I went down to Fitzgibbon Street in the morning——

That is my only motivation in regard to this matter.  I have no other motivation.  While I will perhaps have to put up with the smear obviously going around as a result of it, I want to make it very clear that this Government holds no brief for any individual, that it expects everyone to be treated equally before the law——

If that is his requirement and he includes two members of the Garda from the fraud squad in his staff, he will proceed with that with the full support of Government.  That is the situation.I am not prepared to do what has been suggested to me because it may, in some way, put that at risk and not because I hold any brief for anybody or for who they are, what they are or who they eventually emerge to be.  That is not my motivation.  I have no interest in any of that.I am simply trying to ensure the process of investigation is concluded as quickly as possible.  I ask that it is concluded as quickly as possible and that the decisions which flow from it are proceeded with.  We hold no brief for anyone.  The law should affect everyone without fear or favour whatever way that turns.In regard to the other matter, I am also very cognisant — this is something the Deputy and the Fine Gael Party will know from detailed briefings with the Minister for Finance — that we are in a situation where we want to maintain stability in our financial system and ensure our financial system remains stable.  That is a very great challenge in the present circumstances.I say to people who quite rightly, as I do, wish to see emphasis placed on proper oversight, proper supervision and proper outcomes to any wrongdoing that has taken place, let us please keep our eye on the big picture too, which is to ensure at the same time, and not at its expense, that our financial system continues to operate in a way that helps to serve the economy.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I am not so sure that it is of such insignificance that it has entirely escaped the Taoiseach's mind because of what a commentator, whom I wish to quote, said at the time.  John McManus, writing in the business opinion section in The Irish Times on 3 April 2006 days after the decision was made, stated:The idea that the Minister for Finance should actually condone favourable tax treatment of this type of investment over plain vanilla share buying is hard to defend.And the fact that between 20 and 50 per cent of the trades done in Dublin are done via CFDs should actually set the alarm bells ringing in Merrion Street.  The Department should be asking themselves what will happen to all these leveraged investors when the inevitable down turn in the market comes.That was very prescient because now we know what has happened to all those investors and to the banks now that the downturn has come.  The overhang of Quinn shares in Anglo Irish Bank, which the Minister described yesterday as causing instability in the bank, brought about a situation where that bank ended up having to be nationalised, where our entire banking system has been put at risk, where repeated efforts have had to be made to restore confidence in it and where tens of thousands of people in our economy are losing their jobs as a result of a lack of credit being extended to them and as a result of what is happening in banking and the economy.  That is the consequence of it.That is what the Taoiseach was being warned about by this commentator in 2006.  It was also what he was being warned about by Deputy Burton in 2006 when she raised this very issue with him.  The Taoiseach this morning and Ministers put on media over the past few days are trying to spin the line that something untoward was going on in the banks, that they discovered it only lately, that they are trying to sort it out and that this is the Government acting tough with the banks.  The fact of the matter is that the Taoiseach's stewardship, as Minister for Finance, has contributed to the hole we are now in economically.  The Taoiseach was at the heart of it.The Revenue Commissioners decided these things should be taxed.  Up to 40% or 50% of transactions were being done in this way.  It was a form of gambling.  These people were taking risks and gambling with the economy and shares.  Why would they not do so?  They did not have to pay tax on it.  No stamp duty was being imposed.  If they had to buy the shares, they would have had to pay the stamp duty.  The Revenue Commissioners said they should have done so but the Taoiseach responded to lobbying from somewhere about which he has yet to tell us which reversed the Revenue Commissioners' decision and they carried on partying, as Charlie McCreevy would say.  Now we know the result.  The banks and the economy are in trouble and the Taoiseach was the Minister for Finance charged with the stewardship of this.  At the very least, he was unwise in the decisions he made and, at worst, he was not doing his job.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	158	In regard to what happened in Anglo Irish Bank, the problem was that the international credit crunch brought about a situation where its business model came under immediate pressure and the market made a decision on that.  Its perceived exposure on the construction side was regarded as another negative but the idea that it was just in regard to the CFD issue is stretching things considerably.I said that the acquiring of a shareholding by Mr. Quinn through the CFD mechanism was causing concern and was referred to me by the Governor in his normal meetings with me as Minister for Finance, which are conducted on a regular basis, and was unwound through 15% of shares being converted to shares for Mr. Quinn and his family.  The other 10% then arose in regard to this other arrangement which is now under investigation by the regulator.That source of instability was dealt with in July but, unfortunately, what we are now finding out is that the nature of the transaction in regard to the shareholding made up of the investors which was referred to the regulator has now been referred to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  It has to be dealt with to see whether it was a commercial loan conducted in the ordinary course of business.  There are indications that perhaps that may not be the case.  That issue has to be resolved by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.However, to make the leap the Deputy just made that the CFD issue has caused all this problem in the banking system is totally exaggerating the case.

Deputy Kenny has suggested that the ultimate amount involved could be of the order of €300 million, but the problems in Anglo Irish Bank were far greater than that.  While it is a very large figure, in the context of overall banking stability it will not have the impact suggested by the Deputy.  It would be better for us to keep things in perspective.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Of course it did not help the situation, but that source of instability was dealt with in July and August through the mechanism we have just been discussing.  However, the problem now is that an aspect of the nature of that transaction is under investigation.  Those are the facts with regard to the CFD position and the unwinding of the shareholding by Quinn in that bank with regard to that matter.  It is an exaggeration to associate with us and CFDs the rest of the problems of the economy, including the international recession and the depreciation in sterling.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.The projected cost of the communications unit in 2009 is €294,083, with €153,038 being a direct cost to my Department and €47,005 on average being borne by three other Departments which have staff seconded to the unit.  The cost for the unit in 2008 was €302,235.  The role of the communications unit is under continuous review in terms of its efficiency and cost effectiveness.Following a review of the unit's work, in conjunction with an audit of Departments' usage of external media monitoring companies, various possibilities were explored with a view to improving efficiency, eliminating duplication and implementing cost savings.  In order to assess whether a viable alternative solution is available that would achieve these objectives, the Department of the Taoiseach issued a tender for a centralised Government contract for the provision of a press cutting and media monitoring service for all Departments.Currently, some Departments have individual contracts with media monitoring companies to provide them with media notifications specific to their areas.  In order to ensure that the most efficient and effective service is utilised across Departments, it was decided to explore the appointment of a single provider that could provide a viable solution, leading to cost savings across the service.  Tenders received are currently being considered and a decision whether to proceed on this basis will be made shortly.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	173	These questions may seem somewhat irrelevant following Leaders'  Questions which dealt with issues on a larger scale.  The last time I raised this issue the Taoiseach said the communications unit was under continual review and that the Department had tendered for a centralised system to be provided by a single provider.  Has that matter been concluded?  Was a tender received and has it been accepted?  Will we see a centralised single provider looking after this area?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	174	Tenders have been received and are currently being considered.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I have been examining whether a viable alternative solution that would achieve the same objectives as the unit is available.  I issued a tender for a centralised Government contract for the provision of a press cutting and media monitoring service for all Departments.  Tenders are being considered currently and a decision will be taken shortly.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	177	The unit is just a listening post for the Government and its use has been questionable from the beginning.  Ministers and their immediate staff are perfectly capable of reading newspapers themselves and there is no need for others to read them for them or send them on transcripts, copies or faxes.  At a time when teaching assistants are being removed from special needs children, the book grant is being taken away from disadvantaged children and vaccinations for 12 year old girls are withdrawn, the communications unit is a luxury the State can do without.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers would be well able to live without it.  I am aware the amount saved would not be large in the overall context, but shutting down the unit would be a signal that the Government is cutting its costs and expenditure at a time when other people are being asked to cut theirs.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I am reviewing the situation to try and centralise the work.  The unit does important work.  The Government must be able to deal with the output of the multiple media that exist now, which produce a greater output than even five years ago.  We must have an interface with the media to do that job.  This unit is part of that interface and it provides services in that regard to the Government.  I am examining whether we can do that work more cost effectively.

The argument for the retention of the unit is also exhausted.  Like Deputy Gilmore, I put it to the Taoiseach that role of the unit is null.  Would the Taoiseach agree that we should now depend on the Government press office for this work?  Given that each Department also has press officers in situ, does he agree that the communications unit is unnecessary triplication of what is required in terms of getting Departments’ messages across?  Does he not agree it is time to close the door on the unit?

I have indicated the work being undertaken by the unit and the ways and means by which we can get the work done more effectively.  I have sought a tender, which is being considered, and we will take it from there.

The total cost is approximately €294,000, but approximately €45,000, on average, is borne by three other Departments with staff seconded to the unit.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together.An Agreed Programme for Government 2007-2012 is, as its title suggests, a programme of priorities to be delivered over a five-year period.  Progress in delivering the programme is kept under review.  The Department of the Taoiseach website published, on 24 September 2008, statements regarding the progress made by Departments in implementing each of the commitments in the programme.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	186	When the Taoiseach announced the national development plan he stated it would be delivered in full, on time and on budget.  Clearly, it is based on projections for economic growth that are a distant memory.  I would like to support the Taoiseach here.  Given the state in which we are now, is it possible to concentrate on elements from the plan which are labour intensive such as building schools, smaller road contracts or public works of one kind or another?  These could employ very sizeable numbers of people and would be a confidence booster in their own way.  They would get people back to work and give them a sense of respect and they could make a contribution to the economy.Every local authority in the country should be in a position to employ sizeable numbers of people.  The salary scales might not be that great but if one will pay €250 or €230 to people on the dole it would be far better to get productive work from them with a contribution or assistance from local authorities.  Has the Government considered the possibilities for employment in the shorter term on this type of contract?  While the development programme itself contains more than 500 commitments many of them, as the Taoiseach knows, cannot and will not be achieved for a very long time.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	187	We have sought to identify labour intensive projects and we have re-oriented some work being done in this respect, including increasing allocations for schools.  A broad estimate of the total number employed through the capital investment programme is 100,000.With regard to local authorities and the question of how one can provide alternatives to receipt of unemployment benefit, Ministers are examining in what way we can assist in this matter through training, the back to education programme and other such programmes within budgetary constraints and using the existing resources available across a number of Departments.  We are also trying to increase the throughput of those who can gain access to these programmes.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	188	A number of other measures could be taken at very short notice.  An entire batch of apprentices in various crafts and trades are blocked.  In the system that operates at present an employer sponsors an apprentice who then goes to FÁS and outreach education centres or colleges of education.  In many cases, the employers are out of business now as they may have been in the construction industry.  On the other side, the decision of the Minister for Education and Science to change the pupil teacher ratio means that teachers in many of these colleges of education will be gone by September.Last week, I was with Deputy Barrett in Deputy Gilmore's constituency visiting the Dún Laoghaire College of Further Education.  I suggest this system could be changed so that apprentices would be able to complete their apprenticeships through the colleges of further education in cases where employers go out of business and where there is nobody else in the region.  It would mean they receive a piece of paper which is an international qualification.  They should be allowed to do this.The Taoiseach should speak with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs about the restriction on the back to education allowance.  A range of people now out of work want to return to education to pursue a career but they are blocked by the system because they must sign on the dole for six or nine months before they can take on a course for which they might be well-qualified and which would keep them occupied in pursuing an alternative career. These suggestions could free up a number of places at very little cost to the Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I understand that we are making arrangements to lessen the time which those made redundant must wait to avail of back to education schemes.  With regard to apprentices, arrangements are being made by the Tánaiste in her Department to ensure those in the process of completing their apprenticeships and who may become unemployed as a result of the downturn can continue with programmes in colleges to be able to complete their apprenticeships and obtain qualifications.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I agree with Deputy Kenny's point on educational opportunities for people coming out of employment.  One of the difficulties now is that a cap on numbers has been operating in the further education sector for some time.  This, combined with the change in the pupil teacher ratio, is causing a reduction in the number of courses being provided.  The Government should examine this with regard to getting people back into education.  Many people are coming out of employment but the opportunities in the further education sector are restricted because of the cap on numbers.I want to ask the Taoiseach about the programme for Government because it is now a work of fiction.  When it was written it was predicated on a growth rate of 4.5%.  Commentators now state the contraction in the economy might be as great as 6% this year.  The programme for Government made reference to reducing class sizes but we see them being increased.  It also made reference to reducing taxes but they are being increased.  This year, for the first time, a formal review of the programme for Government was not published.  Normally, a full compendium review is done of the programme but this did not happen this year.  I understand each Department put a statement on its website about whatever progress was being made.We now have the unusual situation where we do not have a programme for Government on which anyone can rely.  We do not know what are the Government's intentions on a range of areas.  Is it intended to produce a new programme for Government which will set out realistically what the Government intends to do in whatever little time it may have left in office?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I assure the Deputy we intend to complete our tenure if at all possible.  The programme for Government is also predicated on balanced public finances and clearly, the crisis with which we are now contending means this is a major challenge and the top priority of any Government.  As Opposition parties are finding out, their sums must add up if they want to put themselves forward as a credible alternative.  I notice they are having some difficulty in doing so.With regard to the programme for Government, the priorities are being reassessed by Ministers in the context of the budgets now available to them.  As Deputy Gilmore has seen, a considerable slowdown in the growth of current expenditure is unavoidable.  We also have the €2 billion savings which must be completed.  These could have come from social welfare services or pensions.  While Deputy Gilmore agrees with the need for cuts he does not agree to any in practice.  The basic point to be made is that the programme for Government will be used as a means of identifying the priorities under the new circumstances in which we now operate, recognising that all of these commitments are predicated on trying to achieve budgetary balance.With regard to providing more places for people in higher education, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, is in discussions with institutes throughout the country with regard to the potential in the next school year to provide places and courses more suitable and appropriate to the present economic circumstances and for those becoming unemployed.  There is capacity in some of our institutes to achieve this.  The Minister is working away on this in liaison with them.

These are rolling out infrastructure nationwide, combating climate change and, lo and behold, developing a fully modern patient-centred health service.Given that the programme for Government also refers to growth of 4.5% and the roll-out of all the promises in the national development plan, does the Taoiseach agree that, in the current economic circumstances, the programme for Government no longer has relevance and requires revisitation, as I have requested recently?  Does he agree that it requires more accurate reflection on what is achievable in the current circumstances?  There is no point in beating a bold drum here this morning and saying we remain committed to it.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Government will not be in a position to deliver what the programme spelt out at the time of its drafting?What will the Taoiseach do in respect of particular aspects of the programme for Government, including the statement that one of the primary aims is to optimise the value of any oil and gas finds for Ireland?  Does the Taoiseach accept that, against the reality of the dodgy deal regarding the Corrib gas find and the giving away to multinational developers of any potential profit that might accrue from the development of such a find, at the expense of the Irish people, he is not presenting a real prospect, unless the Government decides to make a direct intervention on behalf of the people?What does the Taoiseach intend to do about the commitment I mentioned in respect of the health services?  Given the current trend towards privatisation and centralisation of services, does he not accept that the appropriate response at any time, but certainly in the current circumstances, and perhaps in the Taoiseach's, is to revisit the policy positions being pursued by the Government, including the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and directed and administered by Professor Brendan Drumm, the CEO of the HSE?  Is it not now time to make some gesture towards the promises contained in the programme for Government and to translate some of those promises into real deliverables, even against the backdrop of all the current difficulties?  The current difficulties in regard to health might even offer the Taoiseach an opportunity to better deliver a health service in keeping with the people's wishes rather than in the interests of specific sectors within the health services.

This is more than twice the average in the European Union.  Despite the very serious financial circumstances we face, we have maintained that commitment this year, as difficult as that is, because we believe the capital programme provides the building blocks for future growth.  We could have sought to resolve our present budgetary problem simply by cutting capital expenditure out of existence but we believe it is on the current side that we must engage in further reform and achieve further efficiencies and that it is through the tax system that we must raise more money.On the question on climate change, we continue to pursue policy.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been doing so very well.  On energy policy, I do not know whether Deputy Ó Caoláin's party supports the bringing onshore of oil and gas.  It certainly does not have much interest in bringing them onshore in the west, despite the fact that all the various legal channels have been pursued.  Perhaps the Deputy's idea of ownership of oil and gas for the Irish people is to leave it in the ground for another 5 million years, after which they would still own it.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I hope it is not on the record because I am in possession myself.With regard to oil and gas, we have, pursuant to an Indecon study, changed and updated our oil and gas licensing arrangements in a way that will encourage exploration at the same time as seeking a return for the Irish taxpayer in respect of any resources found.  These arrangements have been very much welcomed and are in line with international trends.  We could have very prohibitive terms if we wished but no one would come near us to drill a bore hole in the ground.  Some people's ideology is such that they believe that is a great idea, but I believe in trying to explore whatever resources we have while, at the same time, obtaining a return on investment and ensuring Irish workers can obtain employment from those resources.  I hope the Deputy will change his position soon on what is happening in Mayo and allow the people there to proceed with the exploitation of a very important national resource and asset that needs to be brought onshore quickly.With regard to the question on the health services, Deputy Ó Caoláin has a particular view of our health service with which I do not agree.  We have seen many improvements in our health services despite continuing problems.  With regard to cancer care in particular, we have noted that the setting up of centres of excellence is in the patients' interest.  Often what is portrayed as a local interest can be in fact a vested interest.  It may be a case of professionals who have built up services in various parts of the country seeking to retain them, regardless of whether there is a sufficient critical mass of activity in the units in question.  There is no doubt that, in a modern health service, the need to plan strategically and provide centres of sufficient activity is critical in clinical terms and in terms of health economics.  In terms of operating in the interest of patients and of having sustainable services, these are the important policy considerations.In a range of areas, we have witnessed increased throughput, increased numbers attending hospitals, and an increase in primary care and community care provision.  I am glad to say that, in respect of the administration and organisation of health services, there is recognition of the need for more local autonomy in decision making so we can have a more customised, customer-responsive service, particularly in respect of community care.  I refer to the establishment of a national hospitals office, the need to consider acute hospital care on a national basis and the effort to reconfigure the delivery of services in the interest of patients and in the interest of ensuring we do not have a recurrence of some of the terrible problems articulated in this House in the past because services were not organised properly.These are challenges that must be dealt with by any Government in the interest of patients, in spite of well organised interests to the contrary, which interests are no doubt sincere.  I noted in my area the ability of people in the system to seek to influence events and this can be just as significant a factor in service delivery as what is objectively in the best interest of patients themselves.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I welcome the Taoiseach's emphasis on labour intensive infrastructural projects.  School buildings were mentioned as a possibility.  To what specific projects does the Taoiseach refer?  Does he consider rail development labour intensive infrastructural development?  If he does, will the Government include rail as a possibility to be rolled out under a new national development plan?In regard to the north west gateway, there are question marks as to whether Project Kelvin is going ahead in terms of location rather than funding.  There are issues around that.  I know the Taoiseach will suggest I table a parliamentary question on the matter but I would like his office to examine the issue because it is a project that affects both sides of the Border.  I ask the Taoiseach to examine that project because of the question marks hanging over it.Other than school buildings, what specific labour intensive infrastructural projects are envisaged and does the Taoiseach consider rail development to be part of that?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	211	All of these capital projects have a labour content but it is clear that school buildings and smaller contracts in regional areas are of assistance to smaller builders.  In that context, I refer to the energy efficiency programmes and what is being done in that regard.  Money is being allocated by Government for the scheme that has been announced and I understand there has been a good response to it.  That is an indication of what can be done for localised building-type projects whether it is for individual housing, group housing or school and health care projects.  It is important to be mindful of that.As the Deputy suggested, I will take up Project Kelvin with the Minister and see what exactly is the situation.  I will let him know the position.Rail is an important part of the Transport 21 programme.  In the next few years in particular we will see a considerable investment in that area as outlined in the plan.  I know the Deputy has a particular interest in trying to extend rail to his constituency and I have heard him articulate that on a number of occasions in the House.  However, the priorities at the moment are to try to meet the existing commitments we have in that area.  We will have a tough job meeting existing commitments rather than seeing what other possibilities there may be.

What are the Taoiseach's plans for reform of the Dáil and Oireachtas?  Is he happy with the current arrangements and procedures in the Dáil and Standing Orders as set down?  Does the Taoiseach have any plans to make changes or is he happy to let the Dáil continue as it is and as it has been doing for many decades?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I have been here a couple of decades myself and there have been changes from time to time.  I know the Deputy has a genuine interest in this area.  The Chief Whip, Deputy Pat Carey, is working on what proposals the Government will bring to the table for consideration on Oireachtas reform.  It is an ongoing item.  Unfortunately, I have said in the past that previously Oireachtas reform has meant to what extent the Government can accommodate the Opposition.  In terms of the best use of all our time, there are definite reforms that I would like to take place that would help me do my job better.  I await with anticipation what the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, will have to say to us.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	214	How soon does the Taoiseach expect to have proposals from Government, given the fact that it is more than a year and a half since the election when those sentences were penned in the agreed programme for Government?  We have seen nothing from the Government side.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the Opposition parties have put forward a number of proposals but we have heard nothing back?  Will he kindly expedite the matter as soon as possible so that we can have a genuine discussion to improve the situation for all of us?

As I said, there is a working party under the direction of the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey and some Ministers who have been former Whips themselves can bring some of their experience and ideas to the table also.  The working party has met and it will meet again shortly.  The Ceann Comhairle, on behalf of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, has also put forward proposals and ideas and all of those are in the mix.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I wish to follow up on Deputy Kenny's question about schools.  One of the best programmes introduced was the devolved scheme through which smaller schools could get jobs expedited more quickly.  We recently visited Laragh school in Cavan where the prefabs have been in place for 37 years.  Would it be possible to reintroduce that scheme as it has been abandoned?  Such a scheme can bring in local builders and get jobs done much quicker than under the other scheme that goes through Templemore.As the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, is sitting beside the Taoiseach, I seek a commitment that the Ulster Canal will go ahead as it is a major cross-Border project that is part of the existing programme.  It is important that it would not slip in this new situation.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	220	Pre-planning work is under way on the first section of the Ulster Canal to Clones.

Co-financing will also be a great help by getting everyone to put in their euro and sterling.  That will be a great opportunity to show what North-South co-operation can do.  I am sure Deputy Crawford will do all he can in that regard also.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I agree the summer school scheme has been a good one.  It was devised at the Cabinet table and is a practical response to the need to empower local boards of management to get on with work themselves rather than going through rigid departmental procedures that are time consuming if nothing else.  A significant amount of remedial work in particular has been done under the summer works scheme.  Literally, thousands——

Hundreds of projects have been carried out under the devolved scheme.  I have seen many instances of it in my constituency.  Such projects gives a great sense of ownership to the community rather than it being something that comes from on high.  It allows many people with various skill sets in local communities to do the work and, as Deputy Crawford indicated, do it more cost effectively with the flexibility and know-how on the ground at home that brings a lot of community support for those projects, which also involve much fundraising.  It is great.  It is another example of how we try to release local initiative, which is something I agree with in many respects in regard to many schemes.

I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the inequality arising from the exemption of judges from the payment of the pension levy which, although appearing to be justified under Article 35° of Bunreacht na hÉireann that safeguards the remuneration of the Judiciary, is open to debate as such a levy could be said to be a form of taxation and the imposition of same is not in fact contravening the constitutional safeguard of said remuneration.

We had been led to believe the Bill would deal only with the so-called pension levy.  It has been considerably widened and includes provisions for changes in the early childhood supplement, the farm waste management scheme and other matters.  The Long Title is also exceptionally wide.  The word "whereas" is used six times, which considerably widens the scope of the legislation compared with what was originally signalled to us.  Will this be the final version of the Bill to be enacted?  Has the Government plans to introduce amendments on Committee or Report Stages?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The Minister for Finance will listen to the debate to see if there will be Government amendments on Committee and Report Stages.  There may be drafting amendments in the normal course of events.  It was indicated, contrary to what the Deputy said, that legislative changes were required in respect of all the elements announced in the €2 billion package, including the early childhood supplement, the levy and the waste management issue and that we would incorporate them in the one Bill.  If he is under a different impression, the record will show I indicated we would have an omnibus Bill on these issues as a matter of urgency.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20429	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	239	A report published earlier highlights a high level of non-compliance with elements of the disclosure provisions of the code of corporate governance and a recommendation that the code should be enforceable in law.  Does the Taoiseach intend to incorporate such enforcement in one of the forthcoming companies Bills because it is important in the context of regulatory confidence in Ireland that we have a regulatory regime that applies to all quoted companies?I refer to the new regulatory legislation he has promised.  Am I to believe the only investigation into regulatory failures is being undertaken by the regulatory authority itself?  Does the Taoiseach agree that is a hopelessly deficient approach to resolving our regulatory failures?  One cannot expect an agency to be judge in its own case or to be the only body hiring consultants to assess what needs to occur.  Could we have a proper, independent assessment, which would inspire confidence that the new regime will be based on much broader consultation than that undertaken by those who have been found to be defective in their roles?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I will mention the Deputy's suggestion on the first matter to the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The report issued by Grant Thornton earlier indicates some companies are not complying with the code and this will be carefully examined to see what policy response is needed to help bolster business and public confidence, which is an important consideration at this time.  We will have to examine carefully the practicality of moving from a voluntary code to a statutory basis in the interest of business efficacy and, as the Deputy said, of upholding corporate governance principles, which are important.With regard to regulatory reform, the Minister for Finance will come to Government in due course with proposals for consideration about changing the regulatory arrangements we have in this country.  There is no question lessons must be learned.  We also have to see both domestically and internationally a response to the present financial crisis that will result in a different type of regulation, not only in regard to structures but also in regard to interaction between regulatory authorities and financial institutions to bolster public confidence and to confirm there is a response commensurate to the challenge we face.Regarding the question of the regulator conducting the investigation, it is important that the regulatory authority is the independent body to investigate.  In respect of any case where an authority is regarded as inadequate or insufficiently speedy, the issues are normally resolved by active boards, which are in a position to ensure the executive of such authorities carry out their missions and work in the way expected by the public whom they serve.  The issue is examining the structures, which has been a matter of debate in recent times.  We have a relatively modern legislative framework but the nature of regulation will change internationally and domestically and we need structures in place, which will satisfy people that we are responding in a commensurate way to the need for oversight and real time knowledge of what is happening.

It is a commercial arrangement with a facility being provided by the banks concerned to the industry and the public generally in respect of assisting in the accessing of finance for important work such as energy efficiency and so on, which can make business more competitive, maintain jobs and contain and cut costs.  The fund does not require a statutory basis.

Would it be possible to have a debate in the House and introduce appropriate legislation to discuss the importance of competitiveness for the future of the economy?  There are two proposed Bills that are purely cosmetic and do not deal with the fundamental issues.There is a social welfare Bill, No. 82 on the list, which proposes to introduce a means-tested payment using the habitual residency clause as a means of qualifying.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Our energy bills are among the highest in Europe.  We all welcome today's announcement by Bord Gáis that it is to enter the domestic electricity market, which hopefully will provide some relief.  However, businesses and domestic consumers are still being crippled by unnecessarily high electricity bills.  The Taoiseach in recognising this made a commitment to ensure that energy prices would come down.  They have not reduced.  The regulator prevaricates——

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The regulator prevaricates and the Minister pontificates and nothing is happening.  I ask the Taoiseach to take charge of the issue.  Legislation is promised.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	269	——there is no reason for this delay.  The Taoiseach understands this — he is the head of Government — and I urge him to take charge.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	271	It is impossible to indicate at this stage when that legislation will be introduced.  I understand there is a consultation process in place.  As the Deputy knows, the electricity industry is a regulated industry.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	272	Over-regulated.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The Commission for Energy Regulation dictates prices.  I have indicated, as has the Minister, that an interaction is going on to see in what way, consistent with the regulatory regime, we can reduce prices as an assistance to business at this time.  I believe that as a result of that work any possible changes that may be envisaged can be brought forward more quickly than would otherwise be the case under current arrangements.However, I emphasise it is a regulated industry and was brought to that point in order to try to facilitate competition, which is now coming into play thankfully.  I hope it will replicate what we are seeing happening in the gas industry, the announcement of which I very much welcome today.  While the Deputy suggests that others pontificate, the Labour Party policy position gestates.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	293	People cannot do business unless the Government does the business.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	297	The Bill being published today that is rather euphemistically titled the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill, which may be a matter of contention, contains an obligation on the Minister for Health and Children to engage in consultation with health bodies on the reduction of payments for health professionals.  As we all know, the Competition Act is an obstacle in that regard as evidenced when the issue involving pharmacists arose last year.  We have also had issues with regard to actors and others.  There is a promise to amend the Competition Act.  Will that now be brought forward as a matter of urgency?  Under the legislation published today, the Minister must consult.  However, under the Competition Act there are difficulties with the Minister consulting with the representatives of doctors, pharmacists, dentists and other health professionals.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Is legislation being introduced to deal with the issue?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	299	The Deputy has raised a legislative issue, which will be dealt with by the Minister for Finance during the course of the debate.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I am pointing out that the Government is trying to do something it will not be able to do under this legislation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	304	When will we see the public transport regulation Bill?  Last week, we were to have a debate on the Deloitte report on bus transport, but it was postponed because of the financial crisis.  Will we have an opportunity to have that discussion, perhaps next week, before there is any industrial action and services are withdrawn from commuters?  As usual, the Minister for Transport seems to be taking a very hands-off approach to the problem.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Is a debate on this issue promised?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I believe the Whips will be meeting this evening.  If this issue is a priority for Members, it can be discussed in that context.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I wish to follow up on a point raised by my Dublin North-East constituency colleague on the loss of 1,400 jobs at Dublin Airport.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach advised me that the Tánaiste was going to try to address the matter.  What initiatives is she taking?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	308	She is taking initiatives.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	312	Everything that can possibly be done is being done in that area.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	313	There is promised legislation in the area of management companies.  A number of management companies have gone belly-up.  There is a lien on the title of the houses in these areas requiring householders to pay the management levy.  As they cannot find anybody to whom to pay it, houses cannot be sold.  Another problem arises with the affordable housing scheme, which is a highly desirable scheme.  People living in affordable houses, who are stretched to meet the repayments, now need to also pay management fees within these areas.  There is no control; there is no limit on the management fee.  There is no regulation of it.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Is legislation promised?

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I ask the Deputy to raise it on the Adjournment.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	319	This is happening in housing estates with no flats or anything else.  Given that this matter has been examined by a committee of Ministers and the Attorney General, and that it has now been decided to introduce a single Bill, when will we see that legislation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Work is continuing.  It was discussed again at Cabinet a couple of weeks ago.  I assure the Deputy that work is continuing on the issue.  It is very difficult, unfortunately.  It is not a simple area.  However, that does not take away from the fact that we need to introduce legislation as soon as possible.  There is more work involved.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	321	Will the Taoiseach give the House some idea of when the PricewaterhouseCoopers report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as promised so that all Members will have the opportunity to read all the details which the Minister for Finance may have missed when he was going through it?  I refer to reports in today's newspapers that the European Commission will more or less take us into an emergency supervision mode——
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	322	The Deputy will have to find another way of raising the matter.

Is the Taoiseach proposing to introduce any legislative measure so that we do not find ourselves in the doghouse vis à vis the European Union on this issue?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	327	Is legislation promised in the latter area and in respect of the report?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Legislation is not required in that area.  If Deputy Costello wishes to show his concern he might support the €2 billion of efficiencies we are bringing forward to help bring our public finances into order and I look forward to his support.

While welcoming the Bill I pointed out the existing inequitable system of payment support for those in long-term residential care and how the Bill offered vastly different levels of support to patients in the public and private systems.  I also pointed out that while every resident in public long-term care has to pay the charges, these are capped regardless of the level of means, whereas the same individual availing of private long-term care may be entitled to a subvention to assist with some of the costs of care but this subvention is subject to rigorous means testing.  Persons in private long-term care may therefore be deemed ineligible for the subvention and may be obliged to meet the full costs of care.  In essence, the current system means that people on the same incomes can end up with vastly different care costs depending on what type of nursing home they use, whether it is public or private.Overall, under the current subvention scheme, the State effectively meets only 40% of the estimated average cost of care in a private facility while meeting approximately 90% of the cost of care in a public facility.  A number of examples were given to the House of patients in private care who now have no savings left, no house to sell and are in a very difficult and vulnerable situation.  Only for the generosity of the owners of those private nursing homes, they would have no place to stay.  It is the case that many patients are in private nursing homes who are not in a position to pay the full costs, which currently run up to €800 to €900 per week.  This is the average cost of keeping a patient, paying the staff and making sure that medical and other needs such as food, are met.  I hope the new arrangement will reverse this imbalance for the sake of our old people.I refer to pressure on the acute hospitals sector.  There are so few places available that patients with very minor ailments have to remain in hospital because there is nowhere else to send them.  Sometimes families refuse to take relatives from hospital and this is putting significant pressure on the acute hospitals sector and is holding up beds that could be used for other procedures.  This issue was raised by a number of previous speakers.  I hope this new fair deal will free up additional places in hospitals for a greater number of people from the community at large.Another issue referred to by a number of speakers is that of standards.  I appeal to the Acting Chairman because I expect silence in the Visitors Gallery.

When Deputy O'Dowd and others highlighted the horrors of the Leas Cross nursing home scandal, the Minister gave a commitment in the House that new standards for residential care would be introduced as a priority.  More than three years later, it has still not occurred.  A number of Deputies have emphasised this point in the House forcibly.  Hopefully, when the Minister replies to the debate, she will be specific in her announcement of the new standards and will provide the House with a date.In January 2007, draft standards for residential care settings for the elderly were published and formally referred to HIQA for finalisation.  On 11 March 2008, HIQA approved the standards and submitted them for the Minister's approval, as required under section 10(2) of the Health Act 2007.  To date, the standards have not been approved and it is unclear as to when that will occur.  It is crucial that they be finalised and enforced as a matter of priority.  The Minister must confirm and clarify whether they will comply compulsorily to both private and public nursing homes and, if so, the timeframe for their implementation.According to the Minister, draft standards and the regulations required to underpin them are subject to a regulatory impact assessment before finalisation.  Will she clarify when that assessment will be finalised and when the approved standards and regulations will be put in place?  It is important that she provide this information in her reply this afternoon or whenever.What plans does the Minister have to ensure that public nursing homes, which are often older than private nursing homes, will be able to cope with the cost of meeting new standards?  From discussions with a number of private nursing home owners, I know that this is a concern for the public homes.  They are worried that they will not be able to meet the new standards.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether there is an intention to help the people in question?Under the new scheme, money will follow the patient.  Public nursing homes will compete with private nursing homes, but the latter already offer more competitive prices.  Will there be a decrease in the number of public beds and a move towards private care?  Ultimately, it is a matter of resources.  Currently, the subvention scheme costs more than €900 million.  Are there enough resources in the 2009 Estimates to ensure that the fair deal is initiated, standards are met and assessments are carried out?   It looks as if there are not, but I look forward to the Minister of State's response to my questions.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  The Bill has been before the House for quite a while and every Deputy who has welcomed it is anxious to see it finalised with a view to its implementation at the earliest possible date.  I welcome the fact that the Government has made an initial allocation of €55 million for that implementation, funding the support scheme for the second half of this year.The Bill would have been welcome during the country's boom period.  Given the economic worldwide recession, it is now more important than ever that it be enacted.  Many of my constituents who present to me, even those couples where both people are in employment, find supporting one or more elderly parents or relatives in private nursing homes difficult.  We allowed this situation to develop despite the significant quantity of money that we were spending on subvention which, it has been stated, amounted to €300 million.  While the spend was welcome, we must recognise the fact that the subvention only covered a small portion of the overall payment required to secure and maintain a nursing home bed for an elderly relative.Even when times were good and there was full employment, many thousands of people were at the pin of their collars supporting their elderly relatives.  We all know of families where some siblings care a great deal about the support they provide whereas others do not care as much.  Many of those to whom I refer must live their own lives, meet their daily, weekly and monthly household bills and, in many instances, pay for their children's third level education.  They are at the pin of their collars trying to make up the balance.  Even with the elderly person's old age pension and the maximum subvention, there is a serious shortfall.  Where only one family member is prepared to support his or her elderly relative, it is a considerable draw on his or her resources.  Many people have found themselves heavily in debt as a result.On the other side of the coin are the public residential care homes, of which there are two in my county, namely, St. Ita's Hospital in Newcastle West and St. Camillus's Hospital in Limerick city.  Both are fine institutions that provide a top level of service, which is so good that everyone requiring residential care wants to be admitted to one or the other, depending on from where they come.  Unfortunately, there are not enough beds to accommodate everyone and there is a significant dependence on the private sector to make up the missing complement.  Most of the private nursing homes in my county with which I am familiar also provide a fine service.While there may have been isolated instances of poor care, one is one too many.  In the Leas Cross case, there was a shameful abuse of the elderly.  This issue must be and is being addressed.  I welcome that the elder abuse service is now in place.  Unfortunately, it is necessary, given the remaining cases of elder abuse.While I welcome the Bill, two buzz words that are being bandied about are "equality" and "equity".  We have neither.  One could develop the argument that there is discrimination, albeit unintentional.  If two patients present to a public residential long-stay hospital, the good system in place assesses their financial means, social circumstances, dependency levels and ailments.  Patient A is admitted to the facility and charged his or her pension minus a certain amount per week, which is rightly returned to the patient as spending money.  It provides the family involved with a sense of consolation.  As well as being guaranteed a top level of care, people are guaranteed that they will not need to put their hands in their pockets to come up with the balance, unlike in the case of patient B.  Through no fault of the case conference but given the recession, the home must tell patient B that he or she cannot be accommodated.As his or her dependency level is one, two or three, A, B or C or whatever, he or she must choose a private nursing home.  While so doing for the level of care is fine, it places a huge financial burden on the family in question.  I welcome the fair deal legislation under discussion today because it will bring about equity and a level of equality that is greatly desired by all.  I understand the National Treatment Purchase Fund will act as the brokers that will agree on a price with such private nursing homes.  I further understand that each elderly patient will pay the same amount, regardless of whether a public residential unit or private nursing home care is chosen, which will be highly welcome.Much play was made of the clawback requirement in respect of a percentage being taken from a person's estate when he or she passes on to his eternal reward.  I have discussed this issue with many constituents who have approached me with difficulties regarding subvention and shortfalls.  While I have stated that the Government at present is in the process of introducing the fair deal system, most people wish to deal with the here and now.  They want to ensure there is no serious draw on their financial resources arising from being obliged to support an elderly relative.  Incidentally, the vast majority of people would love to keep their elderly relatives in their own homes with the support provided by the State and the help of their families and friends.  However, as this is not always possible, unfortunately such people must be placed in long-stay care, which is a serious drain on people's resources.  The clawback will be put in place and people will be well prepared to meet that demand if and when it arises.  Their view is that if they are unable at present to afford to provide the requisite level of care and if an estate is bequeathed subsequently to their family, they then will repay the State in some fashion for what it paid for the care of their elderly relatives.I have encountered another issue that I consider to be wrong.  In respect of assessment for subvention, I meet many people whose elderly relative had been living alone in what was the family home but who suddenly required placement in a nursing home.  It is difficult to ask one's mother, father, sister or brother to leave his or her home to enter long-stay care and it is completely unacceptable to penalise a family, were that home to remain empty.  The HSE assesses the potential value of the income from that family home, were it to be let out as rented property.  I certainly would not like to see an "For Sale" sign being erected beside my mother or father's house on the day after he or she entered a nursing home.  However, in the event that such a family home is retained or not let out and no income accrues from it, a penalty is placed on the elderly relative because that asset and the potential income from it is taken into account.  However, if a single family member still resides in that house, the same penalty does not apply.  This is a difficult situation and while I consider it to be an anomaly that should have been addressed, obviously it was not and it is now too late to so do.I welcome the opportunity afforded by this legislation to eliminate once and for all the discrimination that has taken place.  I do not blame anyone as this is the way in which the system has worked.  We have chosen to subvent private nursing homes at great cost.  Obviously, this will stop and the State will have a system in place in which it will continue to pay for care in the main but in which those in private nursing home settings and public residential units will be asked to pay the same amount.  This is welcome because I understand that approximately 8,000 people are in public long-stay care at present.  I cannot praise such facilities sufficiently highly because I have experienced them in my own constituency.  I also have had personal experience of them in respect of both my parents and the level of care and attention to detail given by those involved is second to none.  Moreover, as I stated previously, in most instances the level of care in the vast majority of Ireland's private nursing homes is second to none.  This also is to be welcomed because although one may criticise the Government for giving tax breaks to people to build such private nursing homes, the public system by itself would not be in a position to provide the requisite public bed capacity.  As this would not have been possible, I greatly welcome that we now will be in a position to support all the people concerned.  While the clawback will be in place, there must be some payback for the State's commitments.This welcome legislation should pass through this House as quickly as possible to allow the Minister to enact this Bill and have the scheme up and running at the earliest possible date.  I believe it will be broadly welcomed and will constitute a huge relief to many people, particularly in difficult economic circumstances in which there is significant demand on such people to pay for their elderly relatives.  I am familiar with families in which one parent each of the husband and wife is in a nursing home.  While having one elderly relative in a nursing home constitutes a major draw on resources, obviously having two relatives in nursing homes doubles that commitment.  It is time to be honest and to note that regardless of whether one likes it, many siblings in many families either cannot or refuse to pay a fair share towards the support of their elderly relatives.Deputy Deenihan made a valid point in his contribution when he referred to the occupancy of acute beds in some instances by elderly patients who cannot be moved from such beds because of the lack of step-down facilities.  However, there is another reason.  Were one obliged to make a decision today, tomorrow or next week about one's elderly relative, who is taking up an acute bed, and were one in a financial position in which one genuinely could not afford to pay for or support that relative in a private nursing home setting and furthermore, if one could not ensure the provision of a public bed in a public residential long-stay unit for one's relative, one would have a problem.  In such cases, perhaps little blame should attach to those who walk away from the acute hospitals saying they could not take home their elderly relatives because they did not have the facilities or wherewithal to provide the requisite level of care.  I refer to cases in which people cannot place their elderly relative in subvented nursing homes because they lack the wherewithal and financial resources to make up that gap of the additional resources required and who have been told that no long-stay beds are available in the public system.  In some cases, the proposed new legislation should alleviate this problem to an extent and should free up some of those public beds.  I believe it will and that this is a win-win situation.While it still will constitute a massive draw on the State's resources, as I noted previously, most people would much rather keep their elderly relatives at home.  In an effort to ensure this preference continues, the Government should at all times support in whatever way it can those families who are good enough to keep their elderly relatives in their own homes.  I refer to measures such as home help and home care packages.  This is being done at present and must continue because a massive saving accrues to the State in all such instances.  Consequently, Members must ensure they do not simply pay lip service but continue to support and to increase support for all those who are good enough to do so, by way of the carer's allowance.  The latter allowance is a payment of which many people can avail.  While I accept it is means tested, it is available and acts as recognition for those who are good enough to care for their elderly mothers, fathers, uncles, aunts and other relatives, which is right and proper.  This payment has been expanded and developed over a number of years and the excess amount that someone can earn has been increased continuously, which also is right and proper.There are others who are good enough to care for elderly relatives in their own homes but do not avail of the carer's allowance.  They take on these caring duties because they consider it their duty and obligation to do so.  They are worthy of our admiration and gratitude.  In the absence of their commitment and goodwill, the State coffers would face additional costs as a result of an even greater demand for long-term care beds.I am glad to have had the opportunity to make a small contribution to the debate on this extremely important legislation.  I welcome it warmly.  In recent years I have made the point that the prevailing situation was not equitable and that people were facing serious financial difficulties because of it.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, who has taken a particular interest in this legislation and has guided it through in recent months.  I understand there were significant legal issues to deal with and that it was not a straightforward matter.  I compliment the Minister of State on the introduction of the Bill in the House and I wish her well in bringing it to the Statute Book.The public is crying out for a change in the system.  We will undoubtedly take some criticism in regard to the claw-back.  We can be sure there will be claims that Fianna Fáil is taking money from the dead.  However, we must be realistic in these difficult economic times.  This Bill seeks to ensure there is a fair and equitable system.  I am confident that the public will ultimately thank us for putting this scheme in place.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	375	This Bill is undoubtedly long overdue but whether it has been worth waiting for is debatable.  I welcome any initiative that will support the elderly and their families.  However, I am concerned that there seems to be a general acceptance of the premise that the elderly should contribute towards their care if they are adjudged capable of affording it, without due regard for what that means.  This is the problem with the Bill.  Ensuring there are equitable procedures in regard to who can afford to pay and who cannot and what they can or should contribute is a delicate balancing act.Adjudging individuals as being capable of affording something and the ability of those persons to make payment without causing harm to themselves and their families are two entirely different matters.  Assessing the elderly and imposing charges on the extent of their income and wealth is not only to impose charges on them but on their children and grandchildren.  How is account taken of years of work and payment of taxes during the employment lives of these people?  The elderly contributed greatly to this State for many years through their hard work.  They made it what it is today, or what it was until recent years, before Fianna Fáil paralysed the economy and blew the boom.Our elderly have a right to pass on the fruits of their labour, including their family homes, to their children and grandchildren.  Where an elderly person signs over his or her home to a son or daughter, the latter is then the legal owner of the property.  However, the State will insist on taking its cut when the elderly person dies in order to cover the cost of care in his or her latter years.  Why should the new owner have to pay 15% of the value of the property under this so-called fair deal given that 80% of the patient's income was already allocated for his or her care?In anticipation of properties being transferred into new ownership in this manner, the Bill contains an anti-avoidance provision, whereby assets and income transferred within a five-year period prior to an application for State support are to be taken into account in the financial assessment.  This, as I said, is a direct attack on the sons and daughters of the elderly who are entitled to inherit their family home which, in many cases, they have worked hard to maintain.  It is unfair that the children of the elderly are being financially penalised due to their lack of ability or qualification to give their parents the care they need and deserve.  The parents in turn are left demoralised and upset by the pressure they are putting on their sons and daughters and the loss of their savings, which they had hoped to pass on to their children.  It has been customary in this State for generations to pass on what was earned in one's lifetime to one's family.Government policy as outlined in Towards 2016 is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes for as long as possible and, when that is no longer possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  In the fair deal scheme published late last year, the Minister promised to make nursing home care "accessible, affordable and anxiety free".  However, the budget effectively put paid to such grand aspirations by reducing tax relief on medical expenses from 41% to 20%, in direct contradiction of the fine words "accessibility" and "affordability".Under the proposals to fund long-term nursing home care, older people could be left with nothing because of the charges that will be levied and the inequitable cap on funding.  The deferred contribution based on the family home will be capped at 15% of the value of the property, but the charges on other assets will apply for the duration of care.  This is blatant robbery and extortion, holding the elderly who are reliant on care to ransom.  It puts a whole new spin on the Robin Hood story.  The Government is robbing the elderly and infirm to balance the books of an Exchequer emptied by its own squandering and mismanagement.  Elderly people displayed the fury they felt at their shabby treatment when they protested outside Leinster House shortly after the budget.  Government Members should hang their heads in shame for the ovation they gave to the Minister for Finance on budget day.To expect full acceptance of this Bill with all its grey areas is to expect too much from the Opposition.  If there is an acceptance of valid points on Committee Stage, perhaps some justice may be achieved for the elderly.  The Minister appears to regard the elderly as a soft touch.  The appalling measures proposed in budget 2009 in regard to medical cards for the over 70s suggest that, in her innocence, she assumed the elderly would accept anything.  That was not the case.  Elderly people are well tuned into what is happening and they came out in their thousands to protest.  They should be applauded.  I hope they will persist in their campaign on behalf of senior citizens.  We will all be in that category some day.  The Minister of State was wrong about that and she is also wrong about the finer details of this Bill.Even talking about payment for care of the elderly is unthinkable when one considers the disgusting state of our nursing homes, which are supposed to be elderly friendly.  There are very good nursing homes throughout the country but some are in a deplorable state.  At a time when the Government is promoting a so-called fair deal for those needing nursing home care, the condition of many homes throughout the country is disgusting.  One in three complaints against nursing homes has been upheld, a shocking statistic outlined in various reports.  In my constituency, Longford-Westmeath, I have made repeated representations in respect of the upgrading of the external and internal built environment at St. Mary's Care Centre, Mullingar.  The situation at the centre is undoubtedly one of perspective.  On the one hand people are crying out for action to upgrade some undeniably basic conditions, and on the other there is a concerted effort to deny any deficiencies exist and to brush the matter under the carpet.  While the reality lies somewhere in the middle, the fact that the cash-strapped HSE has said that a new centre is being planned to replace the current structure at St. Mary's in 2011, is indicative of the recognition of existing problems.Any mid-century building, let alone one that was built as a workhouse and not as a hospital or care centre, is certainly in need of urgent upgrading to bring it to 21st century standards for the care of our elderly.  However, for patients in St. Mary's, who are caught in the middle of the debate on its merits or demerits, the care they received from the very dedicated staff, within the restrictions of Government cutbacks imposed on them, is first class.  Those who work in the hospital — doctors, nurses and staff — give excellent care in a dreadful environment of dilapidated buildings.  This was highlighted in recent media reports.  The actor Gabriel Byrne spoke of the right of all our people to have a degree of respect and dignity in their final years.  That is also the aim of politicians.It would be extremely blinkered to deny that some of the facilities at St. Mary's are in an appalling condition and I have photos to prove this.  I have also seen the evidence that restorative and remedial work needs to be carried out at St. Mary's, with certain areas in the built environment presenting serious health and safety issues.  The centre also came in for criticism in the recent investigative report by the Ombudsman into the care of a patient.  The report highlighted the deterioration of the patient in a short space of time.  The response by the HSE to the complaint by the patient's daughter was extremely badly handled and unacceptable.  The bottom line is that overworked and under-resourced staff members are fighting an uphill struggle to provide necessary care for elderly infirm patients, while being very much at the mercy of HSE cutbacks.  This should be a wake-up call for the Minister of State and the Government.  I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, to visit the dilapidated buildings in the midlands and to put her shoulder to the wheel to ensure they are upgraded.  This is in the interests of patients, relatives and staff.  Nothing is as demoralising for staff as a substandard building.For too many elderly people, remaining in their own homes is not an option as social workers and other heath professionals are just not available to provide the care they need.  This creates a desperate situation for relatives when they cannot access community care.  Deputy Cregan referred to the lack of beds for elderly patients in Limerick.  That is not a problem in Longford, where there is a fine facility in St. Joseph's on the Dublin Road.  When will the Minister of State provide funding to allow the newly-constructed 20 bed unit at St. Joseph's, Dublin Road, Longford, which has been idle for the two a half years, to open?  I was there when Ministers visited the hospital and praised the fine facilities but this Government has failed to provide funding for the staffing of the building.  I ask the Minister of State to do so because it is badly needed to cope with the demand for the elderly throughout the region.One person in 20 in this country is elderly and these people are being asked to bear the burden of the Government mismanagement of our finances.  At a time when they should be enjoying care-free retirement, the Government is doing all it can to fleece them of their savings and entitlements.  The inescapable fact is that the number of people aged over 65 has increased by 7.3% since 2002.  It is set to increase to more than 800,000 by 2025 and will have tripled by 2050.  Add to this the fact that Government spending per head on older people is among the lowest in the OECD countries at 0.67% of GDP, compared to an OECD average of just 1%, and we have a picture of a Government with its head in the sand on the issue.  Life expectancy in Ireland now exceeds the EU average and the requirements associated with such an increased life span will not go away and should be provided for.Nursing home care, medical cards and pensions are all under attack from this uncaring Government.  It is despicable that the elderly and very young have become the perceived soft option target of choice for this Government's savage cutbacks, which are necessitated by their own inadequacies and incompetence.  We have evidence of this on a daily basis in the media and in the performance by Ministers in this Chamber.  They seem jaded and resemble prisoners in a dungeon or people who have been shipwrecked.  They are not performing on behalf of the citizens who elected them.  It is disgusting that the Government has forgotten the elderly, who have paid their way all their lives and earned the right to adequate provision by the State for their later years.  Can the Minister of State reassure us that elderly and vulnerable people will not be thrown out into the streets if they cannot afford charges?  Some people in society are very vulnerable, will not be able to pay and will suffer.  Some provision should be made for them.I await the response of the Minister of State to the issues raised in this important debate.  If God spares us long enough we will all be elderly one day and it is important that we have facilities for people in their retirement years, including those who suffer from disabilities, who cannot cope with life, who suffer from Alzheimer's disease and other age ailments.There is a need for an Alzheimer's unit in County Longford.  Elderly people must travel up to 50 miles outside the county to avail of those facilities.  It is not fair to take people out of the environment they are used to.  Perhaps the Minister will concede and do something to provide a unit for patients with Alzheimer's disease in County Longford.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I will be reasonably brief.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, on her contribution to this Bill and her very deep interest in supporting such a worthwhile Government initiative.  The new fair deal legislation is very welcome, as it stems from the time of the illegal charges in our nursing homes up and down the country.  Much time, effort and work has gone into developing the legislation.I am sure many different Departments were involved in the development of the legislation, which I understand took four years to produce.  Those involved included the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Other bodies, such as local authorities, were also involved in providing information during the preparation of the Bill, which I sincerely welcome.All of us have been touched by the need for change in the nursing home subvention area.  From county to county and even within counties, people were not paid a uniform amount of subvention.  This was not fair or equitable.  As politicians we came across many cases where one person up the road was getting one amount in a bed subvention while a neighbour may have been getting a different amount.  The amount of money depended on who the person was dealing with in the HSE.  This placed some very severe financial difficulties on the children of older people who had to go into nursing homes.I am not so sure the term "nursing home" is the best one to describe where senior citizens go.  In many cases, such people go to places which extend their living facilities — perhaps they should be called senior citizen living centres rather than nursing homes.  Many people who go to nursing homes are in very good health but for different reasons they may decide to leave their homes.  They may live in rural areas, there may be nobody to look after them or the local shop or post office may have closed down.  Many people who go to nursing homes are very active and full of life.  These people, or their families, would have paid large amounts of money for this up to now.  In some cases older people sold their houses or other property and moved into nursing homes.It is important that nursing homes are not just nursing homes.  They should provide recreational facilities for many of the people living there who want to be very much part and parcel of the community.  Such people do not want to be confined to nursing homes — they want to go to bingo, senior citizen outings, the Christmas parties and all of that.  It is important that the owners of nursing homes provide such facilities for people living in them.Most older people want to remain in the community and we should consider this seriously.  It is very traumatic for older people, who have lived in a community all their lives up to the age of 70, 75 or 80, to go into a nursing home for reasons they have no control over.  It is very important that we consider how to facilitate people through home care and other initiatives to allow them stay in their community.  It is very important that the post office network, the rural transport initiative and other areas are continually considered to see how we can ensure facilities remain available for people if they want to stay in their own home or community.  In this way they would retain access to the shops or be able to travel to the nearest town under the rural transport initiative scheme.  It is important that while, on the one hand, we are catering for people who want to go into nursing homes, on the other we should also cater for older people who want to continue living in their community.I see Deputy D'Arcy is present.  We are very lucky in Wexford in that we have the new St. John's Hospital for older people, constructed over the last two years.  The first phase has been completed and is open while the second phase of 54 beds has been completed and will open shortly.  That will give over 100 new bed units in Enniscorthy.  We also have Ely nursing home in Wexford, the two senior citizen hospitals in New Ross and the Gorey hospital.Deputy D'Arcy has been very critical of the HSE because it has not upgraded that hospital.  We hope the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, and the Minister, along with the HSE, will extend and develop the Gorey facility.  Gorey and its surroundings have expanded greatly over the past number of years with people coming from Dublin to live there and commute to work.  In many cases people do not have work but they still live in the community.  It is important we continue to provide the infrastructure, as well as the funds, for the fair deal nursing home scheme.  I put on record my compliments to the people involved in the running of the facilities in the Wexford centres.We also have the valuable and important day care centres, which are important to older people.  I am very annoyed that the HSE has decided to introduce a charge for people going into day care centres.  In many cases the day care centres allow people to stay in the community.  They come to the centre during the day to meet their friends and neighbours, have a meal and play bingo, pool, darts or whatever they want.  It is a very important facility and the HSE should think again about putting a charge on those who use it.  It is not the right way to go.I do not have a major problem with clawback.  During what was perceived as the illegal nursing home charges issue, many people claimed money because their elderly relative was in St. John's Hospital in Wexford or different hospitals around the country.  The administration told me such people did not come to see their relatives very often but when the money was there to be claimed, it was claimed.  I have no problem with clawback.  I understand in the UK there is a clawback system but this system must be fair and equitable.  If the house is to be sold on we will get a clawback but if the family in question continues to reside in the house, that is different.  I do not have a major problem with the process.There is an issue with hospital beds.  At any given time in Wexford hospital there are between ten and 20 elderly patients ready to go home but they have nowhere to go.  These people take up hospital beds through no fault of their own.  There should be a greater participation between the HSE and the private nursing homes in that sense.  Surely it is cheaper to keep people in a nursing home than in a hospital.  There is the cost of the hospital accommodation to consider but other people are also being deprived of the chance to come to hospital for operations or other treatment.  Far greater co-operation is needed between the HSE and the private nursing homes in dealing with the matter.The provisions of the Bill should be administered promptly, fairly and without too much bureaucratic nonsense.  With the old scheme of bed subvention, I have had cases where it has taken three, four or five months to get approval for such subvention.  I hope that will not be the system here and we will not have all kinds of bureaucratic delays.  We need dedicated people in the HSE to deal with the applicants and people involved.  It is very traumatic for older people to have to move out of their home and into a nursing home, only then to find it is taking ages to have their application dealt with.  It adds to the trauma and difficulty.  It is very important, when the Minister is designating the scheme, that there should be little bureaucracy and prompt action.I welcome the Bill and the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, is taking a keen interest in ensuring all aspects of it are approved as quickly as possible.  Inspections of nursing homes, as provided for in the Bill, are very important.  We have some excellent nursing homes, some good nursing homes and some not so good nursing homes.  Some of them simply want to fill the home and get the money while providing little by the way of facilities.  Many of those in nursing homes are still active and it is important that homeowners recognise that and provide such facilities.  From visiting homes in Wexford, I know that many of them provide recreational facilities and parties but it is important that we keep the pressure up through inspections and ensure our nursing homes are run properly and kept clean, with the right numbers of staff and proper procedures in place to look after people, without decisions that will affect patients being made behind closed doors.I welcome this Bill and hope its provisions will be implemented as soon as possible rather than our having to endure a load of bureaucracy.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The position on the subvention in recent years was unsatisfactory.  Arbitrarily, some people got different amounts depending on who made the determination.  Whenever decisions are made like that, they create doubt and uncertainty and that leads to anger.  There have been far too many occasions where one family paid much more than another family in similar circumstances.  This will remove some of the uncertainty, a welcome advance.I thank Deputy Browne for making many of the points I was to make on Wexford already but I will mention some of the services available there, services Deputy Kehoe has pursued since his political career began.  St. John's Hospital is a fantastic facility with excellent staff and backup services.  Every person I have seen there is satisfied with all that is done for them.  Far too often the health services are not too good at telling us how well they do some things.  We should pursue this and provide extra funding to ensure that something done well is replicated.  Phase one of the hospital is reaching a conclusion with more than 100 beds in place.Ely House, just across the bridge in Wexford, is also very good and the New Haughton Hospital in New Ross is excellent.  Deputy Browne, however, mentioned Gorey District Hospital, which is the standard former district hospital that was built during the 1940s.  Only a couple of residential long-stay beds are in place there and there are ten or 12 beds altogether.  This exercises me because a huge number of people have relocated to north Wexford, many of whom did so to retire.  Those people are in their late 60s and in ten years, if we do not extend services, there will be a domino effect.  As good as St. Johns, Ely and New Haughton Hospital are, if we do not provide additional bed space for those who will need it in ten years or so, the entire county will experience major difficulties.The population of Wexford has doubled in the past 25 years.  If we look at the CSO figures, we can see many of those are elderly people who left to work in Dublin in the 1960s and have retired to Wexford.  The savage loves the native sod and this is their native county but it is still a good staging post for contact with children reared in Dublin.  The Minister of State must consider the extension of services for the elderly at Gorey District Hospital.I can only speak about those nursing homes of which I have experience and while they are good, they are not as good as the State services being provided.  Nursing homes exist to make a profit but they are being squeezed because of costs rising in recent years.  Costs are declining now but I appeal to the Minister to consider Gorey District Hospital for extra funding.It is unfortunate that an elderly person from my area can be transferred to State facilities a significant distance away.  One gentleman from Coolgraney, close to the Wicklow border, was transferred to New Haughton Hospital in New Ross, almost 60 miles away.  It was a traumatic experience because the man did not know anyone.  Dublin is closer to Coolgraney than New Ross.  This was the same as moving the man to a nursing home in Dublin.  That is not good enough, we must allow people to stay in their local area if it is at all practical.I have experience of the community volunteer sector in Wexford and it is outstanding.  Volunteers provide a service that is much cheaper than would be the case under the HSE.  Those services, particularly drop-in services, are vital because they help to keep people at home, interacting with other members of the community.  We should facilitate this not cut it; many voluntary groups received a 1% cut in funding.  That was not fair or reasonable, particularly when these sectors do the same work for less than the State sector.The HSE refund scheme can cause problems.  I have dealt with inquiries about overcharging and I did not find those working the scheme helpful.  They were not facilitating people to make inquiries even though the money was obtained illegally by the State.I hope the fair deal will give people the opportunity to enter a State facility safe in the knowledge that everything they have will not be consumed to pay for their care.  I am concerned about assets and the inclusion of land and property, where a 5% contribution based on such assets can be deferred.  In the case of the principal residence only, the deferred contribution will be capped at 15% of the value of the principal residence for a maximum of three years.  That is one issue.  Alarm bells always go off with me when I see a matter of interpretation.Section 10 sets out the terms of the financial assessment of means.  Under the terms of the Bill, the HSE is entitled to seek an assessment which will be conducted by a suitable person of its choosing.  There is a lack of clarity as to whether this suitable person will be a staff member of the HSE who may or may not have the knowledge, experience or the ability to conduct the evaluation.If the HSE wishes to establish the market value of an item, it is not bound by any valuation accompanying an application for State support but it is empowered to select a suitable person.  Will the HSE employ a person from within its own ranks or will it appoint an independent third party?  An independent third party should be chosen but there are concerns.  If a valuer values for a seller or for a purchaser, there is always a disparate gap, which can be significant.  We need to be careful about that.  If independent valuations are to be done, there are sources of information we can use to ensure a correct current evaluation is available and that properties are not overvalued because of the State trying to acquire as much income as it can to defer the cost of people being in the care of the State.If a discrepancy is found between the market value of an asset established by the HSE and that submitted with an application for support, the HSE is not bound to this valuation.  If there is considerable disparity between the values identified, this could have significant implication for the applicant or for the State.  As I said, somebody will be displeased.  Under the legislation, there is no opportunity for recourse to find agreement on the issue.  It is important that suitable provisions are put in place to deal with this eventuality.Also, it is not clear from the section who is considered a suitable person and what is meant by "in such a manner and by such means as it thinks appropriate."  That is open to legal challenge and much interpretation.  We must get clarity and establish exactly what that means.  We should do so in the House rather than let people pursue the matter in the courts which will cost individuals or the State significant funds.Under section 10(5), the Minister must clarify who pays for the valuation and if this cost is incorporated into the repayment of ancillary State support.  Again, we do not know the position in that regard.  Section 10(7) states that any information and-or records requested as part of the assessment of means must be provided within 28 days from the date of the request unless otherwise specified by the HSE.  Applicants might have to request documentation from local authorities, third parties or Government bodies and that might take longer than the four weeks in question.Section 29(7) states a person may not request a financial review unless 12 months has elapsed since the most recent financial assessment and that the HSE must be satisfied of a material change in the financial circumstances of the person.  Again, we are back to interpretation which we should thrash out in the House.  The Minister should be able to come back to us before we complete the Bill so we know exactly what those sections mean.  They are loose and open to interpretation.  God knows, this process has been going on since December 2006.  Loose wording such as this should not be part of the legislation.If anything, the volatility of the financial markets over the past 12 months proves that a person's financial circumstances could fluctuate substantially within a short period of time and that a person's ability to pay could be seriously hindered.  There is a significant reduction in house prices every quarter, contrary to what some of the auctioneering bodies are saying.  Information is available to the State when properties are bought and sold.  That is where people could lose out and be charged more than they should be.  Equally, as we saw during the Celtic boom era, it is possible market values could be out of date.  There is a need to bring clarity to the matter.Section 31 provides for certain decisions of the HSE to be appealed within 60 days of notice of the decision being given to the appellant.  The HSE shall appoint a suitable person to consider the appeal.  The Minister has heard my views about loose language in the Bill; there should be none.  Appeals should be conducted by an independent third party in order that a fair and reliable resolution can be reached with which both the applicant and the HSE are satisfied.  It is important that this third party acts in good faith and to the best of his or her professional ability so that no party feels aggrieved.  I do not expect the State to be done out of funds nor do I expect the State to do anybody out of funds in regard to the value of his or her property.On the assessment of income, is money awarded under the nursing home repayment scheme considered?  Again, there is no clarity in regard to that matter.  Are income assets owned in 2009 assessed on their value or at what stage are they assessed on their value?  Similar to the equity markets, if a person had shares in any of the banking institutions in mid-2007, at what stage will those equities be valued?  Will it be at the 2007 or 2008 rate, or at their market value as at the date the person enters a State facility or a nursing home requiring funds?There is a lack of clarity in regard to the assessment of cash values.  We need clarity in this regard because we certainly do not need another version of the health repayment scheme in a number of years time.  Stocks, investments, art collections and vintage cars all fall within the definition of cash values.  Again, at what rate will they be valued, how will they be valued and who will value them?  The encashment value of a product may be worth less than the actual nominal value.  Will it be the market value on the day or the encashment value?The Fine Gael position is that a financial review should be conducted by independent third parties in order that a fair and reliable estimate may be established with which both the applicant and the HSE are satisfied.  This deals with cash and property values.  Members of the public will not be long in telling the Government if they are not satisfied with the scheme.  I am surprised by the number of occasions we have to revisit legislation.  This process started in December 2006 and we need to get this legislation right.  We do not want to have to amend it in the future.  We must thrash it out in the House and ensure everybody is satisfied.In regard to the foreign property aspect of the legislation, tens of thousands of people in the State own foreign properties.  Is such property assessed as a cash or a relevant asset?  The opinion to defer payment against foreign property assets, as is the case with the principal private residence, is not available.  Therefore, money charged against a foreign asset must be raised each year.  People could find themselves in difficult circumstances with falling asset values in terms of foreign property.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	379	There is no doubt that 2009 is a very challenging year for the global economy.  Ireland is very much a part of the global economy and we are experiencing an international recession of unrivalled severity, prompted in turn by the worst crisis in international financial markets in living memory.  Domestic processes in the Irish economy, in particular, the ongoing contraction in the construction sector and its effect on the wider economy, compound the deterioration in international economic conditions.  Consequently, GNP is forecast to decline by 4.5% this year.  Unfortunately, overall employment levels will decline considerably and, as a result, unemployment, which has increased significantly in recent months, will continue to rise this year.The deterioration in economic conditions has had a significant effect on the public finances.  Due to the unprecedented pace of developments in the global and domestic economic environment, the forecasts contained in the October budget were revised in light of the end-year data.  Consequently, in early January revised forecasts for 2009 and the following years to 2013 were set out in the addendum to Ireland's stability programme update, which was submitted to the European Commission on 9 January 2009.I am happy to report that the relevant recommendation for a Council opinion was published by the Commission this morning.  An inaccurate version appeared in a leading Irish newspaper this morning which is not in accordance with the terms of the opinion.  The Commission has made it clear in the opinion recommended to the Council that the measures adopted by the Government in response to the downturn can be regarded as welcome and adequate, given the high deficit and sharply increasing debt position, and in line with the European economic recovery plan.In terms of tax receipts assumed for this year, my Department expects that tax revenue of just under €37 billion will be collected in 2009.  This means that revenue is expected to contract by 9.25%, thus representing a decline of about 20% from the taxes collected in 2007.  Current expenditure now exceeds revenue and in simple terms this is not sustainable.In overall terms, an Exchequer borrowing requirement of almost €20 billion is expected in 2009 not just to finance capital spending, but also to pay for current expenditure as well as the associated costs from the bank recapitalisation programme.  However, it must be acknowledged that we have a low debt ratio relative to many other EU countries.  At the end of 2008, general Government debt stood at 41% of GDP, well below the 60% average of our EU partners.  This measure does not take account of the significant value of the National Pensions Reserve Fund — which was accumulated in better times — or the substantial cash balances held by the National Treasury Management Agency.  When account is taken of these, our net debt at end-2008 was close to 20% of GDP.  While this will increase in the coming years, our low level of debt has provided us with the leeway to target a restoration of balance to the public finances over a number of years.  In this way, we can avoid placing too great a shock upon the system as we restore order to the public finances and re-position our economy.Consequently, the Government has been clear in its strategy to address the difficulties in the public finances over the medium term and is strongly resolved to do so.  Given the scale of the problem, we have set out a five-year framework for the consideration of the Commission on the restoration of order to the public finances.  In this year's budget, I brought forward various tax measures to secure a substantial amount of additional Exchequer revenue for this year.  On 3 February, the Government announced a series of measures to secure the targeted savings of up to €2 billion on a full year basis that are needed to help restore fiscal balance.  The larger part of these savings is in the area of public sector pay and pension contributions, yielding savings of €1.4 billion in a full year.These measures are focused not just on short term needs, but on the vital need to prepare the ground for economic recovery.  By increasing welfare payments this year in the budget, at a time of easing inflationary pressures, we have sought to protect those less well off and those bearing the brunt of the poorer labour market conditions.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseWe have also sought to maintain capital spending in real terms and redirected some of it to areas that can protect jobs.  More needs to be done in a planned way in 2010, 2011 and beyond.  The Government's Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, published before Christmas, provides the guiding light to show the way.  What is now clear is that further controls on expenditure, ensuring greater value for money and additional taxation will all be required as we work our way through the five-year plan for restoring fiscal sustainability.  In this regard, further budgetary decisions will be informed by the important work being conducted by the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes and the commission on taxation.The budgetary strategy the Government has set out is challenging and will require that we all put our shoulders to the wheel in the national effort to deal with this unprecedented economic downturn.  The fiscal position we take, especially this year and next year, is of fundamental importance to the future of the country.  The stabilisation and sustainability of the public finances is an essential prerequisite to the renewal of the economy and it is for this reason that it is the primary focus of our budgetary strategy.

People are terrified their jobs will be the next to go.  Businesses are fearful they will have to pull down the shutters because they can neither get credit nor paid.  The confidence the Minister expressed that the Government has a strategy that is understood and clear is far from shared by either international markets or people at home.  People feel leaderless and lack direction and this is a core problem.  If we want to protect jobs, people must have confidence the Government knows what it is doing.If the Exchequer position deteriorates relative to the Minister's forecasts, will the Government allow the deterioration to be taken up in extra borrowing or does he intend to introduce other measures?  We need clarity on that issue.While the Minister may dispute the description of the strategy he sent to Europe as "unclear" and "underdeveloped", I would describe it as nothing less.  Would he not agree that if we want people to invest for the future, whether in energy or elsewhere, we need clarity about the direction of Government thinking on taxation and other matters covering the five-year period?  Without that clarity people will continue to postpone investment and wait to see what happens.

That is an endorsement from the Commission.  I worked closely with the Commission——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20429	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I did not mention the Commission.  The Minister should answer the questions he was asked.

We have the support of the Commission on the measures we are taking.The fundamental issue with regard to generating confidence is the need to stabilise our public finances.  This is essential in terms of fostering public confidence.  At all stages, we have taken the necessary measures to stabilise public finances —  last July, last October in the budget and through the announcement made by the Taoiseach in early February with regard to further expenditure adjustments.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20429	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I must beg the Chair's indulgence as the Minister did not answer either of the questions I asked him.  He proceeded to cite inept measures the Government adopted in the past, as if this would in some way demonstrate it has been decisive.  The truth is a flimsy document was submitted to the European Commission, we have no forecast of what the Government believes it will collect under any tax head in the next year, we have no monthly forecast of what it expects to collect each month, and we do not know its view on what will happen if we do not meet the borrowing target of  €20 billion, if that.  Goodbody forecasts the requirement will be at least €2 billion over that.What will happen if it is €2 billion over?  Will the Minister take additional measures?  He did not answer that question.  How does the Minister expect people to make decisions if they do not know the direction of his thinking on key variables that will affect the climate for making decisions?  We need a five-year programme that has credibility.  The Minister has not delivered that.Whoever described the plan as "unclear", "unconvincing" and "underdeveloped" got it right, even if it was someone in Timbuktu.  People are saying the same thing on the streets.  People are losing jobs because there is no leadership from the Minister, his Department or the Government.

The forecast in my Department for the downturn this year is 4.5%  and this forecast is in line with the bulk of other forecasts.  On the question of tax receipts for this year, an overall predictive figure for tax receipts has been produced and the receipts received in January are in line with the overall predicted figures.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20429	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The Minister has not published those figures.

The percentage which January tends to bear to the year as a whole has been confirmed in the receipts received this January.  The predicted overall tax receipts this year, as the Deputy is aware, are well short of what was received last year.With regard to the detailed monthly breakdown and the breakdown under the different heads, my Department is taking particular care with its forecasts this year, but they will be available later this month.  It is a five year programme and it would be a brave person who could predict what will happen in 2011 and beyond.  We need to stabilise our finances now——

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	401	The Taoiseach's statement regarding prospects for the live register and for living standards are consistent with the projections contained in the addendum to the stability programme update, published in early January.In this document, projections for the public finances, and in particular for public expenditure, are based on the assumption that the numbers on the live register reach 400,000 by the end of this year.  The January figures, which have become available since the addendum was published, show a seasonally-adjusted 326,000 persons on the live register.  This figure points to a considerable worsening of labour market conditions and is of concern and my Department is monitoring the position closely.In terms of the potential decline in economic activity, the addendum forecast that GNP would decline by a cumulative 8.5% over the period from 2008 to 2010.  Taking into account likely population developments over this period, living standards — as measured by GNP per capita — could decline by between 10% and 12%.  Ireland is clearly in a very difficult economic environment, but so is virtually every other country in the developed world.  This is a global recession the like of which has not been seen for a very long time.The Deputy will appreciate that the potential for substantial new fiscal incentives is severely limited by current budgetary circumstances and by the pressures on our existing delivery systems due to the surge in unemployment numbers.  Notwithstanding these constraints, a range of measures have been taken to help the unemployed back to work.  This is done through the expansion and re-orientation of training, education and employment programmes and by ensuring that the greatest possible number of the unemployed are facilitated and incentivised to engage in these programmes within existing resource constraints.I understand that FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working together so they can respond quickly to the rising live register numbers.  In this context, I understand the following initiatives are being driven by FÁS: the establishment of a training fund to enable a speedy response to identified re-training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers; gearing up its employment services further to provide increased capacity for expected increased referrals from the live register; providing a range of certified, short, flexible, modular programmes designed to upskill redundant workers so they can enhance their prospects of securing employment.  A number of programmes are already in place and the frequency and range of these will be expanded in the coming months.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Also, in response to the construction slowdown, I am informed that FÁS is focusing on providing retraining opportunities for redundant construction workers in emerging areas within the construction sector and that these include retraining in the following areas: the installation of sustainable technologies, environmental activity and compliance and regulatory work.  I understand that FÁS will also assist individuals in seeking employment abroad in construction in other EU countries and that FÁS has held European construction jobs fairs for employers from other EU countries.In addition, the Government is maintaining capital investment at very high levels, which in itself is a short-term stimulus to the economy and to employment.  This investment will also help raise the future productive capacity of the economy.  More generally, the priority being given by this Government to stabilising and bringing sustainability to the public finances is an essential part of its strategy to provide the basis for long-term investment and job creation in this country.  The framework for sustainable economic renewal, which was published in December, also provides a context and strategy within which employment can be sustained in the medium term.In light of what I have outlined, it is clear that despite severely constrained resources, the Government is giving the highest priority to ensuring that those losing their jobs are best placed to secure future employment as soon as possible, while supporting those in employment to the maximum extent possible.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I thank the Minister for his reply.  Does he agree that the situation outlined by the Taoiseach in his speech of 400,000 people being unemployed later this year is a doomsday scenario for those 400,000 people and their families?  I asked the Minister whether he has any proposals to incentivise businesses and individuals to get back to work and in particular whether the Minister has any proposals on job retention?  Does the Minister agree with the Taoiseach's figures that every additional 100,000 people on the live register will cost approximately €2 billion?  Is the Minister aware that in a more recent statement IBEC suggested that the figures could climb above 400,000 towards 500,000?  In the event of these figures being reached do we require emergency measures to retain jobs such as job-sharing?  Where people have lost jobs, does the Minister have full confidence in FÁS as the lead agency to get people back to work, to education and to training in view of the difficulties that have emerged in recent times in this agency?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	403	Certainly I agree with Deputy Burton that this is a very serious position.  With regard to the IBEC figures I know that recent forecasts in the Department predict a figure of 400,000 for the end of this year.  In January, the seasonally adjusted number was 326,000 and while there was a large increase in the month, some of this was anticipated given sectoral developments in recent months.  January's figure was disappointing.  However, it must be borne in mind that this is just one month.  If the January monthly rate of increase continued, the year end figure would be significantly higher.  At this stage we do not expect this as the reactivation and retraining programmes begin to have their desired effects as we go through the year.With regard to the question of protecting existing jobs, the Cabinet committee on economic recovery is examining this issue.  FÁS has a vital role to play and the Government is working to ensure FÁS refocuses its energies from training those already in the workforce to training those who find themselves outside it.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	404	In the retail sector and in business parks in our large cities and towns, many firms are literally hanging on by their fingernails.  The January sales are over.  Valentine's day, which showed a very small consumer upsurge, is also over.  We have a long road to St. Patrick's day and then Easter.  I fear for many firms because there has been no action — or perhaps there has — from the Government to address the difficulties caused by people going to shop in the North.  The Minister spoke about a Cabinet sub-committee on a strategy to retain jobs.  Is it addressing the issue of people marching with their feet and shopping in the North?In his earlier reply, the Minister suggested that the Exchequer figures for tax receipts in the first two weeks of February are a little better than those for January.  The overall figure he gave for the year was a profile of €37 billion.  I have not seen a report from any analyst who expects this figure to be realised.  Does the Minister have a revised figure for tax receipts?  Is it €34 billion or €33 billion?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	405	As I indicated in reply to Deputy Bruton, the final figures on the particular heads and monthly breakdown will be given later this month.  With regard to the question of shopping in Northern Ireland, I never suggested it was unpatriotic to shop in Northern Ireland.  However, I did suggest that it means a substantial loss to the taxpayer in this country and if people are concerned about reductions in services and other reductions which the Government must implement they should bear this in mind when they purchase goods and services in Northern Ireland.  It is a free country and a free market within the European Union and I know Deputy Burton is well aware of this.  The Government is examining methods of ensuring that the sterling differential, which should make products originating in the sterling zone cheaper in this jurisdiction, can be passed on to the consumer.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	406	In recent months, international markets have experienced turmoil and this has resulted in significant pressure on sources of funding for all banks globally.  The Government has adopted a measured approach to this, pursuing a comprehensive strategy to ensure that funds are available for sound businesses and entrepreneurs to enable them to provide the employment and the output which will be the basis of our economic recovery.The Government moved quickly last September to introduce the guarantee of Irish bank liabilities, which has provided certainty to depositors and investors alike in the Irish banks.  The recapitalisation programme announced in December addresses both the expectations of international markets on the capital levels and the needs of our major financial institutions to cover potential loan losses in the years ahead.In January, against a background of concerns about governance issues and market confidence in Anglo Irish Bank, the Government, following consultation with the Central Bank, the NTMA and the Financial Regulator, decided to take Anglo Irish Bank into public ownership.  This decisive step was taken to safeguard the interest of the depositors of Anglo Irish Bank and the stability of the economy.  I want to assure the House that this decisive step was taken to ensure the new nationalised bank will collect all debts due from persons who owe moneys to the institution.Following the announcement of the recapitalisation programme the Government initiated further intensive discussions with Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland with a view to securing the position of these, our two largest banks.  As a result of these discussions, the Government decided on a comprehensive recapitalisation package which will reinforce the stability of these two banks as core elements in our financial system, increase confidence in the banking system here and facilitate the banks involved in lending to the economy.I will continue to examine various proposals, including risk insurance, for the management and reduction of risks within financial institutions, having regard to international developments and to the best interest of taxpayers.  Ongoing work at the level of the European Central Bank and in the European Union will inform the process.In the context of the six month review of the guarantee scheme to be completed by the middle of April, the Government will examine how the scheme could be revised consistent with European Commission approval and EU State aid requirements in ways which include supporting longer-term bond issues by the covered institutions.  This would be in line with international and EU trends where the average term of State cover for bond issues now extends well beyond 2010.  Overall, the Government's approach is structured and incremental and designed to ensure the interests of the banks, their customers and the State are protected.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20429	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	407	The Minister will understand that, on this side of the House, there is a great deal of scepticism over how the Anglo Irish Bank issue has been handled over a long period.  People did not bother to ask the questions that ought to have been asked.Is it not difficult to believe that confidence in our regulatory system will be restored when it is the regulator itself that is accused of being ineffective, at best, or, according to some accusations, complicit in some of the things that have gone wrong?  Is it not hard to believe an investigation carried out primarily by the regulator will be sufficient to restore confidence?What success can the Minister report from his announcement of recapitalisation last week?  Are recovery and liquidity evident in the banks?  Are there other indicators that the approach is accepted as sufficient to deal with the issue?Will the Minister confirm whether payment by the banks in respect of the coupon on the preferential shares is to be optional or compulsory?  A view now seems to be emerging that it is optional.  Does the Minister believe there should be an entirely clean sweep of the regulatory authority and all banks' top executives and boards that receive State capital so we can start afresh?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I thank the Deputy for his questions.  With regard to confidence in the regulatory system and his concern that it will be left to the system itself to address this matter, I can assure him it will not be left thereto.  From the time of the departure of the chief executive of the regulatory authority, I made clear that I intended to bring proposals to the Government on the reform of the regulatory system.  I will take responsibility for those proposals on the advice of my officials.  I do not propose to subcontract responsibility to any consultancy or other group.  I will hear the views of the regulatory authority and the Central Bank.  Yesterday I received a detailed joint submission from those two bodies and it is now under consideration on the part of my officials.  I intend to introduce definitive proposals on the reform of the regulatory system.While I do not believe there should be any subcontracting of responsibility to a consultancy, I believe it would be in the interest of the country, in view of the damage caused to its international reputation by the activities at Anglo Irish Bank, to have some external validation of what we are proposing and of the interview process that must take place for the recruitment of a replacement regulator.The Deputy asked a number of other important questions.  On the question of the coupon attaching to the preference shares, the rate stands at 8%.  Under the terms of the arrangement, were a bank not to pay the 8%, the value of the coupon would be translated into ordinary shares in the relevant State-owned institution, be it Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Bank.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20429	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Would that happen immediately?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	410	In accordance with the terms defined in the warrant, which the Deputy will appreciate I do not have to hand, the loss to the State caused by non-payment will be compensated for by the allocation to the State of an appropriate amount of ordinary shares from the institution, above and beyond the allocation already envisaged in the share warrant arrangement.  As Deputy Bruton knows, this arrangement assures the State of a 25% stake in the institutions, exercisable at the option of the State after five years.On the capitalisation announcement, the question of liquidity and the provision of funds to the Irish banks is still very difficult.  As I stated in my reply, it is difficult for all institutions worldwide, as is the case with many of the measures that had to be taken to stabilise our banking system, including the guarantee, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and capitalisation.  These are not options available to us but essential steps necessary if we are to secure the stability of our financial institutions.  The share prices of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland have remained low and have been such for some time.  To sustain international confidence in these institutions, it was essential that capitalisation take place, such that markets would be assured there was adequate capital and that the institutions would be in a position to meet potential losses.  I do not refer to an adequate position but to a full position.  Capitalisation has generated this confidence and this has been commented on by reputable commentators on banking matters.On the question on the boards and executives of the two capitalised institutions, as Deputy Bruton is aware, the chief executive of the Bank of Ireland has announced his intentions.  I understand from the governor and the board that it is intended to replace the executive in a matter of three weeks.With regard to the chairman and the chief executive of Allied Irish Bank, the State will obtain not only four directors, appointed directly by the preferential shareholder, the Minister, but also 25% of the voting rights at the annual meeting.  At that stage, the Minister can exercise voting rights and influence in regard to the composition of the boards——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20429	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	411	What about the clean sweep?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	412	The suggestion that the State should engage in direct interference in the management of the two major institutions would be dangerous in international markets.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	413	The importance of having a regulatory system that provides financial stability and fosters probity has become all the more clear to us now in a time of severe financial dislocation, both nationally and internationally.  A new and better co-ordinated approach to ensuring financial stability and regulation is now required, with greater focus on areas such as risk management, compliance, corporate governance and general control processes.As the Deputy will appreciate, steps have been taken in that regard in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme Act and, as a result, the oversight of the banks concerned has been intensified greatly.  This new regime provides for heightened direct engagement with each of the covered institutions and new reporting arrangements, including the provision of scheme compliance certificates by the covered institutions themselves and by their external auditors.The bank guarantee scheme requirements and conditions are the first step in a new system of financial regulation and supervision.  The joint boards of the Central Bank and Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority have written to me and have outlined their views on the reform of the system.  This reply does not reflect that fact as I received their opinions only yesterday.  They are under consideration in my Department.Regulatory reviews, both domestic and international, are under way: The regulatory authority is reviewing its overall strategic regulatory approach; the Financial Regulator business process review is now close to finalisation; the Financial Regulator is processing a strategic plan for 2009; at EU level, new regulatory proposals, including improvements to the capital requirements directive, are due for adoption in early 2009; and, at ECOFIN, work is being done to incorporate, at wider international level, the role and mandates of national regulators.I will take account of the various reviews under way on regulatory reform but I accept that, as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the legislative framework within which the regulator operates.  When I have considered the issues fully, I will bring my proposals for reform to Government.I indicated I propose to have external international validation of any proposals I bring to the Government or of any process for the selection of a replacement regulator.  At the time of the departure of the chief executive of the Financial Regulator, I made clear no replacement was to be appointed before the completion of the review.  It is an urgent matter.  I am not conducting a review — I am formulating proposals to bring to the Government.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Did it not cross the Minister's mind to sack the board of the Financial Regulator given its absolutely abject failure to deal properly with the regulation of Irish banks in that there has been a series of disastrous failures in Anglo Irish Bank, which in turn has impacted on the rest of the banking system?  Does the Minister believe the board of the Financial Regulator and former regulator should apologise to the people over what the latter will have to pay for the regulatory failure?  Will anybody on the regulatory board be brought to account for what has happened there?The Minister is aware that the reputational damage caused by the affairs of Anglo Irish Bank to Ireland is immense.  What inquiries are being made in the counterparty banks to the activities in Anglo Irish Bank, namely, Irish Life & Permanent and Irish Nationwide Building Society, given that on his announcement of recapitalisation before Christmas the Minister indicated that approximately €3 billion of taxpayers' money would be made available to those institutions?What is the Minister's response to the bond markets given that Irish Nationwide Building Society has bonds coming due between May and July of more than €2 billion?  That information is freely available.  If we do not restore our reputation who, other than the Irish taxpayer, will replace those €2 billion of bonds?  Does the Minister have any strategy to deal with that?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	415	First, in regard to the position of the board of the Financial Regulator, one of the options under consideration by the Government is the fusion of that board with the board of the Central Bank.  I am not saying the Government has decided to adopt that conclusion but it is a matter under consideration.  In the circumstances the best course is to await the bringing of proposals to Government before addressing the question of the board of the Financial Regulator.In regard to the reputational damage done to the good name of Ireland in banking circles, I am pleased Deputy Burton has acknowledged that that is the core issue in regard to what happened in Anglo Irish Bank.  The various practices that have come to light, that are coming to light and that will come to light in the regulatory reports, have done serious damage to our reputation abroad.  In the case of a small country financial institutions are not readily distinguished by overseas markets and investors.Specifically in regard to the question on Irish Life & Permanent, the regulator is continuing to make inquiries in regard to the full circumstances of the back-to-back arrangement.  Incidentally, I have checked the records in my Department and while there was a reference to the back-to-back arrangement in an early draft of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, the formal summary submitted to me did not contain any reference to that back-to-back arrangement.The regulator is making intensive inquiries about the circumstances of transactions in the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Deputy Burton also raised the status and position of the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  I am arranging to meet the chairman who resigned and I will discuss those matters with him.  I assure Deputy Burton that a close surveillance of this institution is being maintained by my officials and by the regulator and the Central Bank, as is the case with all six covered guaranteed institutions.

I am neither a yachtsman nor a golfer but Deputy Burton seems to have an unwonted interest in them.One matter I am pleased the Deputy asked me about is the question of an alleged promise of €3 billion to put money into the Irish Nationwide Building Society and Irish Life & Permanent.  No such undertaking or statement was made by the Government.  We said we would consider capitalisation of those institutions but we never indicated a precise figure.Irish Life & Permanent is a well capitalised institution and any capital requirements it might have are marginal at best.  As Deputy Burton is aware, the institution has a valuable life company as well as a banking business and all of the market information available about the company suggests that it is a well capitalised bank.  There is no suggestion either that there is any exposure to excessive commercial lending at Irish Life & Permanent.  That is far from the case as it is an institution that did not engage in such.  I wish to make that clear on the record of the House.

I am about to deal with it.  The position is that there have been no discussions about capitalisation between my Department and that society.  I indicated that the retiring chairman will discuss his views with me later this week.  To date there has been no investment of capital by the State in Anglo Irish Bank either.

The approach to this deduction is that it applies generally given the fact that all public servants enjoy the benefits of a public service pension, which provides for greater security and more favourable terms than the generality of private sector pensions.  The graduated approach to the payment is to ameliorate somewhat the impact on lower paid public servants.Owing to the availability of tax relief at the marginal rate for pension contributions, in certain circumstances an individual on a higher gross income may incur a lower net loss than an individual on a lower income as a result of the new pension-related deduction.However, it is important to note that the income tax, PRSI and health levy system is highly progressive.  Those on higher incomes pay higher rates of tax.  Across the entire public service, on all grades and on all pay scales, the total deductions, which include income tax, PRSI, health levy and the new pension levy, will be higher as a percentage of gross pay as pay levels increase.

The first relates to the lower paid.  Does the Minister consider it fair that a single person working in the public service earning €25,000 will only qualify for the contributory old age pension and will get no benefit from 5% of the contribution he or she is making to the public sector?Does the Minister consider it fair that a married person who is the sole earner on approximately €45,000 a year who will qualify for the contributory old age pension will get no benefit from the 7.2% gross he or she is paying?A single person earning €40,000 a year will make a net payment of 3.7% even though he or she pays 7% gross.  Is it fair that a married person who is the sole earner will pay the same gross but he or she will pay 5.2%, which is a higher net payment?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	432	All systems for the extraction of income from a taxpayer or levies paid on a pension involve graduation and progression.  Inevitably, cases can be highlighted that distort the overall picture, which is that we need to make savings in the public service pay bill.  The bands my Department circulated to the social partners represent a reasonable attempt to reconcile the need to achieve the necessary savings while seeking to ameliorate somewhat the impact on lower paid staff.  The banding was the result of significant deliberation on the part of my officials.Deputy O'Donnell will appreciate that given the scale of the savings required any banding arrangement must result in the great bulk of public servants paying the marginal rate on at least some of their earnings.  I would not rule out consideration of other banding options that may be introduced once the savings are equivalent but the savings must be equivalent.  That is fundamental to the operation of the levy.  The new pension-related deduction will operate under what is known as a net pay arrangement, whereby pension contributions for PAYE employees, including those in the public sector, are deducted from gross pay before applying income tax, PRSI and the health levy.

The State will only recoup €800 million rather than the €1.4 billion the Taoiseach stated when the measure was announced.  It, therefore, will not work.  The word "emergency" is used in the Title to the Bill.  The term "emergency" normally indicates something short-term.  Is this a long-term pension levy?  The Minister needs to let public servants know.  Section 8 gives the Minister powers to exempt people.  Will he exempt low paid public servants who will only qualify for the contributory old age pension when they retire from the levy?

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	447	The National Treasury Management Agency has advised that Ireland has a net financing need of €24.5 billion in 2009.  This is based on the forecast Exchequer borrowing requirement of €18 billion set out in the addendum to the stability programme update, the refinancing of a €5 billion bond that matures in April and a sum of €1.4 billion in respect of the frontloading of the Exchequer contribution for 2010 for the National Pensions Reserve Fund relating to the bank recapitalisation programme.  The NTMA estimates that the associated debt servicing cost in 2009 will be €4.5 billion and has advised that it considers the revisions to the debt service estimate included in the addendum are adequate in the context of the current market conditions.The NTMA has also advised that the main reasons for the increase in the forecast cost of servicing the national debt for 2009 over previous years are the increase in the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the higher interest rates prevailing on government bonds.  While the increase in borrowing is the major factor, the current elevated yields on government bonds also contribute to increased debt service costs.  Many factors underlie these yields, including global factors, which are affecting all euro sovereign borrowers benchmarked to the German bond, and national specific factors.The NTMA intends to raise funds on the long-term government bond market through a combination of auctions and syndicated loans.  It successfully raised a 5-year €6 billion bond at a coupon of 4% in early January.  Ireland is rated as AAA by the credit rating agencies.  In addition, we have a relatively low debt level.  The general government debt to GDP ratio was 41% at the end of 2008, which is well below the EU average of 60%.  At the end of 2008, when account was taken of the cash balances held by the NTMA and the value of the NPRF and other funds managed by the agency, the debt to GDP ratio was reduced to approximately 20% of GDP.Our favourable debt level will remain below the EU and euro area averages over the coming years.  While our debt level will increase in the coming years, our low starting point gives us the leeway to target a restoration of balance to the public finances in the next year.  In this way, we can avoid placing too great a shock upon the system as we restore order to the public finances and reposition our economy.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20429	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is alarming that the new debt servicing cost of €4.5 billion is almost three times the amount in 2008 and it is 33% higher than the Minister's forecast last October for 2009.  This reflects the rapid deterioration both in the public finances and in the funding markets.  What premium over long-term German bonds was estimated by the NTMA when it reached this figure?  Ireland currently pays 2.8% more for ten-year German bonds.  Is the agency basing its figure on that or is it more optimistic?When will the agency have to go to the markets again with a funding offer?  It raised funds in January but I understand Irish institutions were very much at the core of subscribing to the offer and they may not be available again.  What is the next test of our ability to raise funds?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	449	There was no preponderance of Irish institutions in the bond issue in January.  There was considerable international interest in it.  One of the unfortunate features of the bond issue while it was being completed was the appearance of an entirely inaccurate story by the national broadcaster about the IMF.  Happily, the story did not affect its completion.The yield on Ireland's ten-year government bonds is approximately 275 basis points over the German equivalent.  This spread over Germany is due to a number of factors and it is impossible to quantify the impact of each.  These include global factors, which are affecting all euro sovereign borrowers benchmarked to the German bond, and national specific factors.  Earlier this year, Germany had considerable difficulty issuing bonds at the stated levels.  The NTMA offered 4% on its bond issue on the basis it was confident market expectations would be met, which was the case.I agree with the Deputy regarding the worrying trend that our gross borrowing requirements this year are far in excess of last year and that is why the Government has brought forward measures to stabilise the public finances.  It is essential we do so.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	450	The Minister said the cost of servicing the national debt is estimated at €4.5 billion, which is almost 100% more than in 2008, when it cost €2.4 billion.  In reply to an earlier question, the Minister suggested the taxpayer had not to pay anything to bail out the banks.  However, he also said one of the reasons for the significant increase in the cost of servicing the national debt was the higher interest rates being charged on government bonds, which has almost entirely been caused by our banking crisis and the fact that our reputation has been shredded internationally.  Is it true that the additional financing cost attributable so far to bailing out the banks is approximately €544 million and, by the end of the year, it will be a considerable part of the additional €2.5 billion needed to service our national debt?

Second, the best market advice I can obtain is that the major difficulty with increasing the spreads lies with apprehensions about Ireland's economic position and our anticipated economic performance given the substantial declines in growth rates that are anticipated and the fear in markets that the Government will not control the public finances.  Happily, the Government is determined to control the finances as the Government is determined to secure the stability of the banking system.  The steps we have taken in recent weeks regarding the public service pensions levy will assure markets that the Government is determined to address the imbalances in the public finances.

I referred to six in an earlier reply.  I should have said that Postbank is also a guaranteed institution.  The covered institutions are AIB, Bank of Ireland, EBS, Irish Life & Permanent, Irish Nationwide Building Society, Anglo Irish Bank and Postbank, their branches and certain named subsidiaries.Under the terms of the guarantee each covered institution pays the charge quarterly, in advance, payable no later than five working days after the beginning of each quarter, during the period in which the covered institution avails of the guarantee.  The charge is calculated by reference to the composition of the covered institution's average month-end covered liabilities during the preceding quarter.  Payment in respect of the first quarter was payable at the end of that quarter.  That payment was in respect of a covered institution's outstanding covered liabilities as at 30 September 2008.  We have received payments from all the institutions for two quarters to date.  As of 4 February, €225,709,643.86 is in the mandated account which is held in the Central Bank.With regard to any planned changes, there is provision in the Act for amendments to certain elements in the scheme, including the charge to the covered institutions.  For example, I am empowered to review the application of the guarantee charging model every six months and to make such adjustments as I deem necessary to ensure the recovery of the aggregate cost to be borne by the State as a consequence of the provision of the guarantee, and that the overall objectives of the Act are achieved.In the context of the six-month review of the guarantee scheme to be completed by mid-April 2009, we will examine how the scheme can be revised subject to European Commission approval and consistent with EU state aid requirements, in ways which include supporting longer-term bond issuance by the covered institutions.  This would be in line with international and EU trends where the average term of state cover for bond issues extends beyond 2010.

I would have thought that after two quarters €250 million should have been raised at this stage, which indicates a shortage of €25 million.  Which of the banks has not provided that €25 million?  The Minister also spoke about extending the scheme.  What period of extension does he have in mind?  Given that he can review the charges in the terms of the scheme within a six-month period, and given the increased borrowing cost to the State involved, will the Minister be making such an increase in the charge under the guarantee scheme to the banks?  What increase does he intend to make?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The purpose of the charge is to cover the long-term cost of borrowing to the Exchequer that arises out of the provision of the guarantee.  These additional costs were initially reckoned to be approximately €1 billion.  The charging model was based on covered liabilities of approximately €450 billion.  As I have pointed out previously, approximately €90 billion of this is covered by the enhanced deposit protection scheme.  The covered institutions do not pay the quarterly charge on liabilities covered by the scheme.  The total of covered liabilities will naturally adjust over time as bank balance sheets change in the normal course of business.  It is fully within my powers to amend the charge to reflect changing events and economic realities.  There is provision in paragraph 19 of the scheme to revise the charge if the long-term cost to the Exchequer funding proves higher than initially estimated.In the first five months of the operation of the charge, it is important that we consider the matter in the context of the review.  I did not believe it appropriate to vary the charge to date.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The Minister spoke about the moneys received to date being lodged with the Central Bank and also indicated that one of the banks may be in arrears.  From the figures he gave, it appears that he is still due approximately €25 million on one of the quarterly payments.  What does the Minister intend to do with this money?  We have a situation in the public finances particularly regarding people who are unemployed.  We also know that small and medium-sized businesses desperately need access to credit.  Does the Minister plan on simply holding the money in the Central Bank until the end of the guarantee period — probably at around the time of a general election — at which point a large amount of money would become freely available for the Government?  The Minister said he would put it back in some way into the national debt.  However, that could mean anything.  I would hate to think it could possibly become some kind of slush fund particularly when at the moment we need dedicated funds available to get credit flowing to small and medium businesses to keep jobs alive.

I was about to ask a very similar question.  The long-term objective is to cover the long-term cost to Government.  However, the short-term immediate need is to free up credit for SMEs in particular to allow them to continue trading, thereby keeping people in employment.  We all know businesses in our constituencies that are closing on a daily basis because they cannot get overdraft facilities or borrow from the banks.  Has any analysis been done as to whether credit is now beginning to flow?  There was little or no evidence of this in the first few months of the guarantee scheme or following the recapitalisation of the banks.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	461	There appears to be €25 million of arrears.  Are any of the institutions in arrears at the moment and, if so, by how much?  The cost of borrowing for the State has increased significantly.  Will the Minister adjust it on the six-month review to take account of this increase?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	462	All the covered institutions have paid the charge in a prompt and timely manner and are up to date.  In response to Deputy Creighton, of course the difficulty for small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining credit is a very serious matter and is taken into the Government's consideration.  We are at an advanced stage in drawing down the European investment bank facility for a number of our financial institutions.Regarding the deposit of the money in the Central Bank, it is important that the moneys obtained on foot of the guarantee are seen by international markets to be on deposit in a secure place for any honouring of the guarantee.  The credibility of the guarantee is important; partly it rests on the deposit of the funds collected in respect of it at the Central Bank.  That said, as I indicated in reply to Deputy Burton, I am open to constructive suggestions about the eventual deployment of these funds on the lapse of the guarantee scheme.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The importance of having a regulatory system that provides financial stability and fosters probity has become all the more clear to us in these times of financial turmoil.  I have already indicated that it is my view that the current approach to financial regulation needs to be reformed.  The Central Bank Board and the Financial Regulatory Authority have examined the approach to financial regulation in Ireland and submitted their views to me yesterday.  I apologise that this information is not in the official reply which was prepared before receipt of the letter.In addition, an independent and reputable firm of consultants has been conducting a detailed assessment of the authority's business processes and procedures.  I asked the board of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulatory Authority for their views, which they submitted yesterday.  I have read their views and referred them for further consideration in the Department.  Relevant developments are taking place at an EU and wider international level.  New regulatory proposals, including improvements to the capital requirements directive, are due for adoption in early 2009 and the Ecofin Council, incorporating work being carried out at a wider international level, is giving consideration to the role and mandates of national regulators as well as other related issues such as prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight.As the Deputy will appreciate, steps have already been taken in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme to improve regulation and arising from this, the oversight of the covered institutions has been greatly intensified.  However, these arrangements will need to be developed further in light of both national and international considerations for further regulatory reform.As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the legislative framework within which the Financial Regulator operates.  When I have considered the issues fully, I will bring my proposals for reform to Government.With regard to investigations of particular events in financial institutions, the legislative framework provides significant powers to the regulatory authority to pursue these matters.  In addition, Deputies will be aware that matters can also be investigated and are being investigated by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20429	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I wish to return to this issue.  There is no one looking at the way in which the regulator performed its duties.  The Minister is talking about new reform and new institutions being put in place.  The only one looking at how the regulator conducted its duties is itself and this is not acceptable.  There has been too much gross failure.  The public are appalled at the golden handshake for the former regulator and the regulatory system cannot be left to itself.Is there not a question about the role played by the regulator when the Quinn shareholding was unwound?  It would appear the regulator accepted legal advice without probing it.  Is there not a question about the role of the regulator with regard to Irish Life & Permanent when it was in possession of that information and according to the Minister, it was allowing him to proceed to put money into Irish Life & Permanent without alerting him to the seriousness of the situation?  The Minister decided on nationalisation later, but in December the regulator had been in possession of this information for months and nothing was done.The only time we saw swift and effective action was when the Irish Life & Permanent issue came into the public domain and immediately, three executives were gone in one institution.  is that not the kind of activity in which the regulator should be involved?  It should not be left to the force of public opinion to effect change.

Some of the leaks of material about this matter may come from parties who have an interest in the outcome of the investigations being carried out by the regulator.With regard to the Irish Life & Permanent transaction, I asked to meet the chairman and the chief executive last Thursday when the media reports appeared which suggested that the regulator had some prior knowledge or notice of the particular transaction of the back-to-back arrangement between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life & Permanent.  When I met the chairman and the chief executive in the Department at lunchtime last Thursday after I left this House, they informed me there was no question of the regulator giving any prior approval or sanction or approbation to that transaction.  The regulator is entitled to complete its investigations and bring the full facts to public light.

The regulator has to be afforded an opportunity of putting the full facts on the record as to whether it obtained independent legal advice of its own.  I remind Deputies that many of these reports are necessarily selective with regard to the complete picture of the transaction and the role of the regulator because there are persons at large who have a vested interest in spreading the blame for transactions in which they were involved.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	468	When Deputy Brian Lenihan became Minister for Finance, who told him about the difficulties arising from the overhang of the Quinn shares?  The Taoiseach said earlier this week that the Minister was advised after he became Minister.  Was the advice given by the regulator, the Central Bank, his departmental officials or someone else?  If it was not the regulator or a message conveyed from the regulator via other sources, why was it not the regulator?  The Taoiseach said that the regulator had become aware and the Central Bank had advised the Taoiseach on 17 March.  That date became referred to in the popular media as the St. Patrick's day massacre as a result of the plummeting in value of the Anglo Irish shares.  The Taoiseach was told when he was Minister for Finance.  If the Taoiseach read the newspapers he could not have missed the St. Patrick's day massacre as it was such an outstanding event.Who told the Minister for Finance and what has been the role of the regulator?  The regulator seems to have had a central role in unravelling the difficulty of the Quinn share overhang.  Therefore, how can the regulator be investigating the unknown circle of ten millionaires who got loans of €30 million from Anglo Irish Bank, without recourse for the shares, to prop up the share price of the bank?  This is one of the events at the heart of the international shredding of our reputation.  I ask the Minister to explain this to the House so there is some clarity about what happened.

I was advised that the existence of this contract for difference, which Mr. Quinn had not committed himself at that stage to purchasing, was a serious threat to the stability of the bank and that the Department had been in communication with the regulator and the Central Bank to ensure that this matter was unwound as soon as practicable.  Beyond that, I was not furnished with any information of a written character about this issue, other than it was a critical issue for the share price of the institution.  Subsequently, I was advised in late July that a group of investors had invested in Anglo Irish Bank to resolve these problems and that legal advice obtained by the bank indicated that the transaction was compliant.  This is the extent of my knowledge of these matters.

The Department referred the matter to the Financial Regulator, who initiated an investigation.On 18 November, the Governor of the Central Bank wrote to me and sent a final summary of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which did not refer to the Irish Life & Permanent transaction.  At no stage was the transaction in respect of the Quinn Group dealt with in the report.  I want the record of the House to be clear in that regard.

The loans total €300 million at €30 million per head among the ten individuals.  Even for Anglo Irish Bank, this is a significant loan exposure in terms of individuals.  How is it possible that the loans were not listed for examination or advised to the Minister as to their status, given the fact that the collateral used for them was shares?

Last week when questions on the back-to-back transaction with Irish Life & Permanent were raised, I tried to be helpful to the House, somewhat to my own discredit, by putting as much of the information as possible into the public domain and outlining the nature of the transaction.  It was a simple transaction and, while it remains under investigation by the regulator, its essential features could be easily disclosed.  This is not the case in respect of the Quinn Group transaction, which is complex.  We await the report of the regulator on it.

Did he not believe this to be material information that would affect the opinion of the House and the shape of the legislation?  One of the proposals that we sought to adopt was to the effect that any write-off of loans by the bank would be put into the public domain.  It was not even reached as an issue, but knowing the ten names would have resolved some concerns.Regarding the defence used, namely, that the investigation could have been prejudiced, all of the information is in the public domain, but no one is suggesting that the investigation is being abandoned because it has been prejudiced and cannot reach a fair conclusion.

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	504	I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which I welcome.  However, we will oppose it on a number of bases.I checked the Citizens Information website regarding nursing homes and found informative web pages.  Were every nursing home to be of the standard referred to on that website, every elderly person in a nursing home would be happy.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  The Bill tries to set certain standards, but I will address this matter later.The care of the elderly is important because they are the people who built the State.  Unfortunately, some are not being cared for as they should be.  In some homes, they are being neglected.  The Minister of State is aware of a number of the homes in question.  Deputy O'Dowd deserves praise for the due diligence he displayed in going about his business highlighting the Leas Cross issue and many other cases in which the elderly were not looked after.Like every Deputy, I visit nursing homes frequently, albeit not regularly.  The minute I walk through a home's door, I can judge whether people are being cared for correctly.  It is obvious when people are happy.  Other nursing homes do not have nice surroundings and the people therein could be cared for much better.I will compare public and private facilities.  Some of my colleagues from County Wexford have already mentioned care of the elderly in the public geriatric hospitals in our county.  For example, when I was elected to the House in 2002, I campaigned for the new St. John's Hospital in Enniscorthy.  Thanks to my work and that of my colleagues, construction on the hospital is at an advanced stage in phase three.  Given the care and attention provided in a public nursing home, there is a considerable difference between the public and private sectors.  The care and attention afforded to patients at St. John's Hospital, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree, are second to none.  However, I criticise the other care centres and geriatric hospitals in my county.  While doing so would be expensive, the Minister of State could use St. John's Hospital as a template for every major town.For example, although the top floor of Ely House, Wexford, is used to provide care for elderly geriatric patients, it is completely unsuitable for such a purpose as it is up four storeys.  Although the care and attention provided by its staff are second to none, it is not a suitable facility for the care of the elderly.  Deputy D'Arcy also referred to Gorey in this regard and the Minister must consider the care centres, facilities and hospitals that are available to the elderly in those locations.Since becoming a public representative following my election to this House in 2002, I hear of subvention cases in my constituency office that are an absolute mess on a weekly basis.  Some previous speakers have noted that one person may receive a particular amount of money while someone else, who lives down the road or perhaps is a relative of the first person, receives a different amount.  The variation in the sums of money that people receive as subventions is amazing.  As Deputy D'Arcy noted this morning, the amount of subvention often depends on whom one happens on within the HSE while making a case for the person concerned.  Although the proposed fair deal should make a great difference in this regard, I fear the Minister for Health and Children is being shortchanged, in that a sum of €110 million was to be put aside for this purpose but it has been reduced to €55 million.  The elderly will suffer because of this shortfall and this is one reason people are highly annoyed.  While they welcome the Bill, people become annoyed when promises are made by the Government but shortfalls arise months later.  Ultimately, the elderly will be affected.I wish to raise a number of issues pertaining to subvention and Deputy D'Arcy referred to loose wording in the legislation this morning.  I refer to an elderly person who goes into care but who has a son or daughter living in the house who is less than 21 years of age.  Will this 21 year old be kicked out of the house when the person passes away and when the HSE looks for 5% of the property?  A 21 year old may not have a job, as he or she could be a student or whatever, and will not have the money or financial support to give 5% of the holding to the HSE.  Similarly, what of a case in which a disabled person, who was in receipt of disability allowance of some kind, lived in the house?  No straight language is being used and this will cause enormous problems in the future after this Bill has been enacted.  All Members have raised delays in subvention for families and huge delays have occurred.  I have dealt with people in nursing homes who were admitted months before any major decision was made on their subvention claims.  I already have mentioned the varying amounts that are being awarded and the existing shortfalls, which ultimately will hit the elderly.I refer to respite for families.  Undoubtedly, all Members are familiar with families being given grants for respite care for two weeks annually.  This is very little to any family who cares for either an elderly person or one with a significant disability.  Throughout the economic boom and for many years, the Government neglected this issue and people have been left without proper respite facilities.  In my native county, I fight and make representations on behalf of constituents to ensure their families are being looked after, especially those with serious disabilities rather than the elderly.  Two weeks in the year is not much to offer to a parent or guardian who cares for a child or an adult with a disability and this issue is not being addressed properly within this Bill either.I also wish to raise the issue of sheltered housing.  My native town of Enniscorthy has an excellent facility for sheltered housing for the elderly, which is run by a voluntary group.  In many cases, voluntary groups and organisations have come together to try to put in place a sheltered housing facility.  Although they do their best, they happen upon a complete brick wall in respect of the amount of red tape through which they are obliged to go.  This has not been made any easier for them although sheltered housing offers an alternative, whereby people can have their own independence while living in a small community village in which doctors, care assistants and care facilities are available to them.This is an excellent facility for elderly people and 90% of such facilities are run by community organisations.  If more sheltered housing in our communities is to be encouraged, matters must be simplified for the community groups and other applicants.  In the main, these voluntary organisations meet at night because those involved are in full-time jobs but, for the good of the community and for the care of the elderly, give up their free time to try to get such facilities up and running.  However, they are not encouraged to so do by the red tape through which they must go with the Department when trying to draw down different stages of funding.  This process could be made considerably easier for such groups to facilitate sheltered housing in their localities.Previously, I referred to Deputy O'Dowd's role in highlighting neglect in the care of the elderly in some nursing homes.  Regrettably, I do not believe sufficient progress has been made in respect of checking nursing home standards.  Sadly, some nursing homes are still in a similar position to that which obtained in Leas Cross and other nursing homes that have been highlighted in recent years.  Undoubtedly, some nursing homes are perpetrating the same neglect in respect of the care of the elderly.  While this issue has been highlighted in "Prime Time" and so on, it is sad to encounter cases in which the elderly are being completely neglected, even though cash-strapped families are paying for their elderly mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles or the elderly in their households to be cared for in such nursing homes.  While the best display always is made for the benefit of visitors, major work is still outstanding in respect of standardisation of nursing home practice nationwide when no visitors are present, during night-time care and when nurses or care assistants are on duty.  Undoubtedly, given the tax incentives that were made available for the building of nursing homes in recent years, the standards that should be in place are not.The Minister of State's closing remarks should outline to the House how the shortfalls will affect the implementation of this Bill.  As for the care of the elderly in some public hospitals, the Minister of State should examine care of the elderly in Wexford and Gorey towns in particular because excellent facilities exist in New Ross and Enniscorthy.  However, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree that the Minister must examine the existing facilities in Wexford town and in Gorey, because families from the southern end of County Wexford travel 30 or 40 miles to visit their elderly family members in St. John's Hospital, Enniscorthy and people from the north of the county travel south to Enniscorthy.Distance may no longer be the obstacle it once was but it nevertheless presents a significant difficulty for some of the relatives of patients in St. John's Hospital.  If such patients could avail of care facilities in Wexford or Enniscorthy, it would be of great benefit to them and their families.  The current economic situation undoubtedly presents significant challenges.  However, there are also opportunities through public private partnership and other means by which the Minister may be able to explore the possibility of providing these facilities.  Such a facility is an absolute necessity for Wexford town, in particular.  Its provision must be fast-tracked.I referred to the prospect of family members being presented with demands from the Health Service Executive and the Department for their share of the family home when the elderly person passes away.  There are major faults in the Bill in this regard which must be clarified.  The language must be more straightforward so that it is clear what will happen in cases where a relative is living in the family home.  These people may include persons with a disability or other type of dependency who are cared for in the family home.  Will the Minister of State clarify this aspect?There remains an issue in regard to the standardisation of care in residential facilities throughout the State.  While some people receive excellent care in privately-owned nursing homes, other facilities are getting away with providing an inferior quality of care.  The elderly are the most important people in this State.  It is they who built the State and raised our living standards to the level we enjoy today.  This is an issue about which I have strong views.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  Not many of us on this side of the House agree with the Minister that the so-called fair deal lives up to its name.  The Labour Party has major concerns about some of the unfair aspects of the scheme.The purpose of the scheme is to provide for those requiring long-term institutional care.  The legislation is explicit in stating that it is intended almost exclusively for the care of the elderly.  Individuals will be assessed on the basis of their care needs and also on a financial basis, and the scheme will be administered by the Health Service Executive.  As Deputy Kehoe observed, the legislation envisages a funding allocation of €103 million, but only half that amount will be made immediately available.  In total, the estimated funding requirement is €820 million.  Therefore, the scheme is labouring under a negative equity before it is even operational, despite the fact that we have been examining this issue for a considerable time.Section 5 of the Bill includes an enigmatic reference to the capping of resources, with the implication that the scheme will come to an abrupt end if there are insufficient resources to fund it.  This is a strange way to put in place a scheme that is designed to deal with long-term institutional care and has many far-reaching implications for the individuals concerned and their assets, ancillary services and so on.  It is a strange statement to include in the legislation.  Will the Minister offer reassurance in terms of the viability of the scheme, with reference to how the subvention is being put together and the issue of resources being capped?The provision of long-term residential care is a critical issue.  All Members frequently encounter constituents who are experiencing difficulty in accessing long-term care, respite care in their homes and so on.  Families are doing their best to provide support and to finance the care needs of their elderly relatives.  In fairness to the Minister, she has at least made an effort to deal with this issue.  However, it is ironic that virtually everything the Minister has touched has turned to dust.  She has not been successful in dealing with any of the issues she identified as requiring action when she assumed her Ministry almost six years ago.  Her first action was to produce a ten-point plan to deal with the crisis in accident and emergency services.  After six months she said the crisis could not be resolved in such a short timeframe and that she needed another year or two to address it.  Six years later, she is still addressing the problems with accident and emergency services.  Reports in yesterday's newspapers indicate that the situation has deteriorated substantially.The basic issue of management has not been addressed.  Accident and emergency services continue to operate in a dysfunctional fashion.  I am well aware of what is happening in my local hospital, the Mater Hospital, where the situation is worse than it was when the Minister came into office.  If, after six years, a Minister is unable to address what is essentially a management issue, we cannot be confident when she attempts to address something as complicated as long-term institutional care.  There is little hope of her devising a solution that will be adequate in this case.  All that is required in regard to the accident and emergency situation is to provide proper access to hospitals, proper treatment therein and proper discharge mechanisms.  Patients are entitled to that but they are not getting it.  This is not rocket science, it is merely a question of management.The Minister made her first fundamental mistake in introducing the Health Service Executive in the manner in which she did before finding herself unable to modify it in a manner that might allow it to become a functional entity.  Every effort she has made has worsened the situation.  It is amazing to comprehend that in 2009, some 30 to 40 people are on chairs and trolleys in the Mater Hospital on a daily basis.  In 2008, on average, 80 people were waiting to leave the hospital but could not do so because the Minister has done nothing to provide for step-down facilities, adaptation grants and so on.  The Minister talks a good talk but she does not deliver.The situation is similar in regard to the Minister's plans for co-located hospitals.  She has made reference to 1,000 private beds being taken out of the public sector, thus increasing capacity for public patients.  However, today's report by Goodbody Economic Consultants indicates a further 25% increase in the cost of private health insurance, which is expected to pay for the Minister's co-location plans.  That is combined with a 23% increase since last November.  In the space of four months there has been an increase of almost 50% in voluntary health insurance and very little to show for it, as well as the enormous annual budget given in this House to the health service.  The situation regarding co-located hospitals is turning into a mismanaged exercise that will not provide extra beds but will simply mean that the subsidy goes to the private sector and ordinary patients in the ordinary hospital will lose out.I would like the Minister of State to answer whether the private sector will pay the full costs of private health care in private hospitals.  Will co-located use remain as a major subsidy to the private sector?  Does the Minister of State mean what she says or is this another guise for tax breaks to the private sector in terms of property and profit that the Progressive Democrats ideology is so good at providing?  An example of this is in legislation concerning the pensions levy.  It is amazing that the private sector, in the form of private schools, will not be subject to the pension levy.  The State provides the subsidy but staff will not be subject to the pension levy.  An anomaly exists that the State has not bothered to address whereby the private sector receives a State subsidy that should be considered for pension purposes but is not being treated in the same fashion.The Minister's grand plan for private health is fundamentally flawed because it exists on ideological grounds, which is part and parcel of the overall Thatcherite and Reagan economics and thinking.  Everything private is good and everything public is bad.  This results in the denigration and degradation of the public sector.  The idea is that there is no such thing as society or social solidarity, therefore, everything that can be privatised is privatised.  The concept of free education and universal free health does not come within the Minister's ambit.  That is the fundamental flaw in her thinking.  There is nothing in the Minister's book about a caring social order that requires universal health care to be provided by society.This is why it is particularly inequitable that the current proposals single out the elderly.  The elderly were singled out in the 2008 budget in terms of the loss of the medical card to those over 70.  That was the Minister's first step towards balancing the books.  The elderly have been targeted to an inordinate degree by this Minister as if they are a burden on the State that she is not prepared to tolerate.  The Health Act 1970 makes provision for free health care but it is more honoured in the breach than in its implementation.The elderly in need of long-term care are the new pariahs in our society.  This includes the over-70s and the elderly who are in hospital, who are bed blocking as it is put by the HSE, and those in need of long-term institutional nursing home care.  These people will be treated in a different fashion to any other sector of society in need of health care.  Anyone else who requires health treatment is treated in the normal fashion but the elderly must be dealt with in terms of their means and their assets.  That is the fundamental flaw in this argument.However, from the Minister's point of view this is the strength of her position because she can avail of the assets before or after the death of the patient in institutional care.  Let us imagine how cold and calculating this is.  Anyone facing long-term care is also facing the family home being taken from the person, either before or after death, in deferred payment and the assets must be dealt with in such a way as to make payments according to the assessment of the HSE.  In a caring social order this should not be part of the solution to a difficult problem.The elderly have been singled out and it imposes an extra burden on them.  They are now seen as problems and pariahs in society.  They are a burden on their children and on their inheritance.  Elderly people who want to see how this legislation will operate and what they will leave behind as their children's inheritance and legacy in their final days will see themselves as depriving their children the longer they live.  This is what long-term institutional care will do under this legislation.  It will make the elderly, in their own eyes, a burden on their families.  Their health will deteriorate because they see themselves as part of the problem.  That is the uncaring aspect of this legislation.  It has a negative impact on the elderly, who see themselves as part of the problem rather than part of the solution.  This is why Age Action Ireland and the Senior Citizens Parliament have expressed concerns about this legislation.  On the one hand they see the benefit of it but on the other hand, they also see the human imposition and the damage that might be caused by it.How is the scheme resource to be capped?  There was an initial contribution of €103 million, which dwindled down to half that amount.  The Government is reneging on its resource commitment.  Is it possible that the scheme will run out of money?  It seems that under the terms of the legislation the HSE is in a position to recoup sufficient funds from the estate of the patient through its financial assessment.  However, the State does not provide further subvention.  Is the State admitting that the capping is as a result of scarcity of resources and that it can pull the plug at any time if it does not wish to make a contribution?  What are the implications for the HSE assessment and what are the parameters of the assessments of the individual's means?  There are criteria and there is a formula.  How far can they go and how far can they meet the failure of the State to fulfil its side of the bargain?  There is a major question over this part of the scheme currently.  If the money runs out, does the care run out?  How robust is the scheme from the Department's perspective?The question from the other side is what happens to the people who do not qualify for the scheme when they are not sufficiently dependent to meet the criteria.  There are very few health care packages in the community currently as all that funding has dried up.  If one operates with a local authority, one may find it very difficult to find one that is prepared to put any adaptation package together for a home, whether it is to adapt a bathroom or toilet or install a ramp for somebody who is seriously ill or in need of any kind of long-term care.  The HSE does not seem to have the funding to provide the service either.This is part of the reason there are so many bed blockers, as there is no integration of services for people coming out of hospital.  The term "bed blocker" is terrible as it implies it is the patient's fault for blocking a bed.  It is in the best interest of everybody to get out of hospital as quickly as possible after treatment.  There are no step-down facilities in the community or adaptation grants available.  There is no integration of services either — the biggest issue — because there is no line of communication between the HSE and any of the community-based services.  Nobody bothered to establish it so the health service operates in a limbo.Tax relief relating to nursing home care, as I understand from the latest budget, is now at a standard 20% rate rather than the previous rate of 41%.  That will be detrimental to the earner's finances in providing care.  All the nursing homes which come within the ambit of this legislation must be approved separately by the HSE.  This will be a major issue because we have had so much fall-out from so-called approved nursing homes, which were not very well approved.  We need a strong code of conduct, criteria and standards in this area.  There are no provisions in the legislation dealing with approval, the criteria for the HSE to assess all the homes that will be approved and how to ensure that in the future, the level of supervision and monitoring will be up to the required standard for a service that is not currently provided.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	506	A number of my constituents have contacted me who are concerned about this Bill.  Some were confused, others did not know what was proposed by the Government and some were very worried about what the Government would propose.  Going back a very short time, I remember the Minister for Health and Children and the Government making big announcements relating to home care packages.  In my county last year the programme had to be abandoned as no new applications could be accepted nor funding guaranteed this year for people who got the packages.Elderly people are very worried about their future.  With regard to home help, surveys have shown that many people would like to stay, be supported and die at home.  The Government and the Minister have produced much talk but there is little action.  This Government has let down the elderly, particularly with regard to home help and home care packages.  Many people would love to stay at home and their families would support them if they got some back-up from the State.As a practising politician I am contacted every day or weekend by somebody who cannot get support from the health authorities that they need.  Nevertheless, Ministers issue press releases and programme managers are feeding the media, telling all the good news.  It does not translate to action on the ground.There are two or three points regarding nursing homes that worry me.  I attended a meeting recently between representatives of the HSE and local representatives.  One issue relating to care needs assessment is significant now and will continue to be significant in the future.  Who will make that decision?  We already have problems in the system where people may know they are not mentally or physically able to go home but a doctor may not think the person is entitled to a State bed.  The person in question may have nobody to go home to or may require other support and may need and want the bed.  The problem is the person in question will not get a bed because an assessment has been done.  In future there will be more stringent assessments.  There will be funding pressures on the system and a directive will be issued — we do not yet know who will do the assessment — to make the procedure as tough as possible in order to keep as many people as is required out of nursing home care.Another issue relates to means.  People are already confused about this and feeling pressure.  Elderly people have made a contribution to the State and look forward to the State providing for, helping and protecting them in whatever way is possible in their last number of years.  That is not happening and people are worried about it.In rural Ireland there are many brothers and sisters and people who never married living together.  If a brother or sister, or a mother or father, goes to a home, there may be family members living at home who are over 21.  If the mother, father, brother or sister dies, such people would have to find funding for the State.  Everyone here knows the pressure this will create for people who do not have the necessary resources.Many people who have come to me over the past few months have put a lot of money away.  Some invested in Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.  These were very bad decisions.  These people were living off those investments and hoping that the money they had worked hard for and invested, which they gave to the banks, would be protected in their interest.  We have seen what has happened in that respect.Even if people's income, land or property value or shares were to be examined since this Bill came to the Dáil, one would find that every single one has devalued in the last number of months, with many at a crisis stage now.  People have entered into agreements with private nursing homes and they do not know what will happen in the future.  They are worried, nervous and afraid and they wonder what will happen to them or if they will be thrown out on the road.I have discussed this before with Deputy James Reilly, who was a practising doctor before his election to this Dáil.  Some people need to go into a nursing home because of medical or mental health reasons.  People may have no loved ones or relatives at home.  They may be feeble and they may feel the best place for them to be looked after is in a nursing home.  They might fall under these criteria and find themselves in a position where their medical need does not match the case for them.The Minister has indicated that this will not affect those people currently in nursing homes but we could go through all the promises made in the last election and the promises from the Department of Health and Children in the past ten years.  We would tick them off one by one and find that the vast majority of them would have been broken or not carried through.  Those in the Department of Health and Children, and the Minister in particular, speak well but do not deliver on the ground, which is part of the problem.People pay their taxes, from which they get a PPS number, and work hard.  They are beginning to wonder if they are a burden to the State and if it has any obligation to them.  I am glad we oppose this legislation because it will not work and we will be back again to deal with the very serious problems in it.  Elderly people who have put money away and who have to go into a nursing home will be under tremendous pressure, as will their families.  They paid taxes all their lives and will pay death duty when they die.  Now they will have a further death tax, which is precisely what this is.  They will have to go through probate and if they die in a nursing home, they will have to pay a further death tax.  This puts pressure on families.  If there was help from the State, many people would not need to go to nursing homes or be dependent on nursing home care.  This is anything but fair; it is unfair and will cause many problems.  We will be back discussing this within two years if it is passed.Many years ago, when Gay Mitchell was senior spokesman for Fine Gael and I was junior spokesman, I used to raise on a regular basis the idea of an inspectorate for public nursing homes.  There is an inspectorate for private nursing homes but where is the inspectorate for public nursing homes?  Even ten years later we have done nothing about this.  People in public nursing homes deserve the same protection as people in private nursing homes.I once raised a case in my constituency and received a lot of flak from the health board.  I saw the conditions people were living in and I raised the issue in the Dáil, getting the health and safety inspectorate in and, lo and behold, the Western Health Board was able to spend £600,000 on the facility.  The people on the ground knew I was right, even though the PR people did a clean up job and brought the local radio station down.  They did not cod anyone though and in the following election I increased my vote by 500.  At every house I was told that I was 100% right and that they were embarrassed when they went to see their loved ones in this facility.  When people highlight problems they are lashed for it, but we want an inspectorate to protect our elderly.There is an inspectorate for the Prison Service.  No one will ever look for any taxes from someone who is in prison for life and they will not have to pay the State for their upkeep.  They are well looked after and protected, there is no doubt about it.  Our elderly people should be looked after, protected and assisted.  If they have paid their dues to the State, the least we can do is look after them.I compliment Deputy James Reilly on raising so many important issues in this Bill.  I am concerned about our elderly.  They have made a major contribution and it is serious that they have to worry about more taxes after their deaths, having paid taxes all their lives and provided for their care.  Now it is possible that their homes must be sold and their families will not be able to inherit them because they will owe so much money to the State.  There are many questions to ask about this Bill and I know Deputy Reilly will raise them on Committee Stage.  In a perfect world, the State would provide a bed for everyone and although that is not possible, the State has a duty to ensure people who want to make a contribution to their own upkeep are supported and helped instead of taxing them after their deaths.This Bill is not good legislation and it will not work.  We will be back to discuss it again in the future.  I would prefer it to work.  I would like people to be assured that if they go into a State home or nursing home, they will not have to look over their shoulders, wondering if their resources will be taken and what will happen to their property and their families after they die.  It is wrong and that is why this will be proven to be bad legislation.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate — more than 40 Deputies spoke, an indication of the interest in this Bill that addresses the care of older people in the future.As mentioned at the outset, the purpose of the Bill is to establish a new scheme which will equalise State support for public and private nursing home residents, ensure that long-term care is affordable and anxiety-free and that no one has to sell his or her home during their lifetime to pay for their care.The Bill addresses the reality that two thirds of all nursing home beds are in the private sector and puts in place for the first time a uniform system of financial support for individuals in public and private nursing home beds.  We have worked hard to ensure that this system contains strong safeguards not only for the care recipient, but also for his or her spouse or partner.The new nursing homes support scheme, however, is only one component of the overall Government commitment to ensuring access to quality nursing home care for all who need it.  While the new scheme addresses the issues of access and affordability, the new draft standards will address the fundamental issue of quality; I know many Deputies alluded to the standards in their contributions.A core principle of the health service reform programme is to put the users of health and personal social services at the centre of the services.  We must ensure the protection of residents, safeguard and promote their health, welfare and quality of life, and ensure that there is a focus on the dignity and autonomy of older people.  These are the core objectives behind the draft national quality standards for residential care settings which are currently under consideration within the Department of Health and Children.  Regulations will be required to underpin the standards and the Minister plans to approve those standards and have the necessary regulations in place in 2009.As is evident, this is a time of great change within the nursing home sector.  In 2009, for the first time, there will be a single comprehensive system of registration and inspection for all nursing homes — public, private and voluntary — and a single comprehensive system of financial support covering all nursing homes.  Moreover, both systems have the nursing home resident firmly at the heart of their service.This is also a time of great change within our population; life expectancy in Ireland is increasing.  This longevity is something to be celebrated, but it also presents policy challenges which we must recognise.  The latest statistics tell us that today 11% of people living in Ireland are aged 65 years or over.  It has been estimated that this figure will rise to 20% by 2036, and to 29% by 2056.  Thus, over the years ahead, our nation's age profile will change.  It is now, while our nation is still young, that we must consider the long-term care services needed to support us over the next half-century and the funding model that, by virtue of financial sustainability, might ensure the long-term provision of such supports.The fair deal represents a response to the immediate situation faced by private nursing home residents.  The Government is also committed to further analysis to identify a financially sustainable funding model which will support the future infrastructure of all long-term care services, both community and residential.  This work is critical to all our futures, both as the recipients of care services and as taxpayers.I would now like to respond to some of the points raised by Deputies in the course of the debate.  Unfortunately, there is not sufficient time to address all the issues raised.There appears to be some concern regarding the care needs assessment and people of medium dependency.  I emphasise that all current residents in approved nursing homes on the commencement of the scheme will be eligible to apply for State support regardless of dependency.  They will not have to qualify under the care needs assessment.The nursing homes support scheme, in line with Government policy, is based on the premise that long-term residential care is not an older person's first choice and should only be considered as a last option.  As such, the scheme encompasses a care needs assessment to determine whether a person needs to be in long-term residential care.The care needs assessment is holistic in nature.  In addition to medical needs, it provides for a person's family and community supports to be taken into account, thus allowing for social factors to be taken into consideration.  For example, a person who historically may have been classed as being of medium dependency, but who lives in an isolated area, may be assessed as requiring long-term residential care.I have been asked to clarify a number of points in regard to the treatment of assets.  First, there seems to be a concern that the HSE will have sole authority for valuing assets.  This is not the case.  The Bill provides that a person will submit a valuation with his or her application form.  The HSE also has the authority to undertake its own valuation at its own expense.  If a person is subsequently concerned about changes in the value of his or her property, he or she can seek a financial review from the HSE at any time during his or her stay in care.Second, where a property has multiple owners, the financial assessment will only relate to the actual interest of the applicant or applicants in the property.  Third, I would like to clarify that foreign property is not excluded from the financial assessment.  The assessment takes account of all relevant assets, including foreign properties.  However, it is not possible for the State to offer ancillary State support in respect of foreign assets.  Ancillary State support, or the loan element of the scheme, can only be availed of in respect of Irish land-based assets.Fourth, the repayment of ancillary State support will be the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.  Revenue will only seek to recover moneys actually paid by way of ancillary State support in respect of the cost of care.  However, in order to take account of the time value of money, the amounts will be adjusted in accordance with the consumer price Index.  This is what is meant by the references to interest in Schedule 2 of the Bill.  Where repayment is overdue or problematic, Revenue will have the power to apply interest or to apply its existing care and management procedures.  However, in line with the provisions of the Statute of Limitations Act, the power of recovery will expire 12 years after the debt falls due.On the issue of quality of care, the Leas Cross Commission of Inquiry has been raised in the course of the debate.  I can confirm that the commission is due to report to the Minister for Health and Children at the end of March and the report will be published after consideration by the Minister.  I wish to confirm that an applicant to the scheme has recourse to the Ombudsman.  The latter can examine complaints against the HSE under the Ombudsman Act, as amended.I thank Deputies again for their contributions.  I look forward to the further Stages of this legislation at which time the views put forward will be considered in detail.  I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.

For those Members who do not remember, I represent Dublin South-West which embraces Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills, Brittas and Bohernabreena.I was interested to hear during the previous debate on this Bill that colleagues have mixed views on the legislation.  I made the point then, in the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, that he is, to some extent, damned if he does and damned if he does not legislate.  People suggest the Bill was struck in a different time and that times have now changed.  Times have changed, but at the same time it is important that employment compliance remains a priority.  This Bill may be subject to some tweaking and I was impressed by the Minister of State on another occasion when he said that he was prepared to listen,  In fairness to him, he has demonstrated that this is the case.  For those who do not know, I am a fan of the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, and I will not apologise for it.It is important that we understand that workers have rights.  On other occasions I have stated — I should probably hesitate before stating it in this company — that I bring my life experiences to politics and that in other times I worked in companies.  I was made redundant on three separate occasions.  I do not know whether it will happen to me again.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I know what it is like to go home to tell one's family about the difficulties one is experiencing as far as one's working life is concerned.  It is a challenge and it is something about which we should all be concerned.  In the times we are in, it is easy to suggest taking the brakes off as far as labour law is concerned, but those of us who have commitments and trade union backgrounds understand that many workers still believe that no matter what the times are or what they bring, we should still protect workers' rights.  In fairness to the Minister of State he has made this point.He also made the point, which I articulated previously, that he was responding as far as he could to representations made to him from many colleagues across the floor on the protection of employees.  It is fair that those colleagues on the other side of the House who state that he might do things differently remember where this started and from where the impetus for the legislation came.  The Minister of State must make up his mind and decide what is best for the workers of this country.  I suspect he will get much support in this regard.I note that when the Minister of State introduced the Bill, he stated its main provisions included the establishment of NERA on a statutory basis with a tripartite advisory board.  He also mentioned the strengthening of the inspection and enforcement powers of NERA together with provisions designed to secure compliance, including the protection of employees against penalisation for claiming their entitlements or "whistleblowing", such as reporting breaches of employment legislation to NERA.The Minister of State also referred to specifying the statutory employment records.  Colleagues across the floor have queried this and I will be interested to hear how the Minister of State reacts.  In a very eloquent address to the House, Deputy Seán Barrett made that point that we should be trying to help employers as much as possible.  I will not be two-faced about this legislation but I take the point.  It is important to understand the need to protect employers.  However, at the same time, this should not be to the detriment of workers.  It is easy in these changed times — I will state this from the Fianna Fáil benches — to state that we should go easy on employers.  I am sure their representative bodies will make these points.  Let us not forget that workers have rights and entitlements and let us find a balance as far as the Bill is concerned.The Minister of State also spoke about fostering increased co-operation at workplace level so as to safeguard employment rights and to make provision for the exchange of information between statutory enforcement authorities to facilitate joint investigations where breaches of the law are suspected.  The Minister of State made the point that he was committed to strengthening the powers of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to initiate investigations and to publish the outcomes in cases of public interest.  He referred, as many colleagues did, to the Gama case which upset everybody and it is important to state this fact.  The Minister of State also spoke about the involvement of labour inspectors, for the first time, in the enforcement of provisions of the Employment Permits Acts and the strengthening of those Acts as regards records and other obligations of employers.This Bill needs to find a balance.  I can speak about my constituency as much as anybody else and I do not wish to be particularly parochial about this legislation, but I live in the third largest population centre in the country.  The beginnings of my community endeavours and political career can be traced back to representing workers' rights.  Colleagues sitting slightly to my left might be surprised at this but that is where I came from — in 1994, I was a founder member of Get Tallaght Working, which still survives and is doing a tremendous job under the name Partas.  It represents the need for jobs and enterprise in my town.As colleagues know, Tallaght has a record of job losses over the years.  In another debate I stated that at present everybody is speaking about the need for jobs in his or her own area.  I have no difficulty with this and I heard the case being made for Limerick after the Dell calamity and for Donegal and other regions.  Every colleague in the country has my sympathy as he or she makes the case for his or her region.  I can certainly do this because Tallaght has more than 7,500 people who are unemployed.  We have a young population and we must continue to do what we can to create employment and to shout as loudly as we can, even in these difficult and challenging times, about the job creation needs of our constituencies.I am old enough to remember other times of recession.  I am certainly old enough to remember when conditions for workers were not as good as have been developed in recent years.  I am certain the Minister of State will take account of the fact that we should not roll back on progress made in labour legislation over the past decade.  I listened very carefully to the debate and to points made by my colleagues, and I respect many of these points of view and hear what is stated about another organisation being established.However, I am struck by the Minister of State's commitment to respond to what colleagues stated.  I recall he had a great line in which he stated that Deputies on all sides of the House had many parliamentary questions and debates when the Government was condemned for having "more dog wardens than labour inspectors".  The Minister of State put on record, I am sure in a very accurate way, that this has changed.It is important that the Minister of State understands that he will have much support.  I suspect that even colleagues giving counter views will also understand the need for this legislation and will not oppose him as far as the thrust of the Bill is concerned.  It will be interesting to see how various colleagues make different points and what position is formed.  I suspect this will be a unique occasion as far as the development of legislation is concerned where it is necessary for the Minister of State to listen very carefully to the various points being made and take account of how the times have changed since the Bill was prepared.  I wish the Minister of State well in this regard.  He knows he will have my continued support.  I will have time on other occasions to press him for more jobs for Tallaght and I am sure he will not mind this.

It has been in the pipeline for a long time and I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs is in the House.  As he knows well, I have raised a number of these issues with him over the past 12 or 18 months.  Will the Minister of State indicate where we are with the labour inspectorate?  Do we have the complement of 90?

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	516	We are still short more than 12 months after the agreement in Towards 2016.There are a number of issues pertaining to migrant workers that I want to raise.  I raised a specific issue last September that was highlighted in the Quarterly National Household Survey.  It concerned certain sectors in which migrant workers were out-competing Irish workers in respect of particular jobs.  These sectors included the financial and business services sector, the wholesale and retail sectors and even the construction sector.  When I raised this with the Minister, he stated the underpayment of foreign workers and the large number of foreign students comprised a significant reason for the differential.  There is no doubt that part of the differential arises because of migrant workers with third level skills moving here.  It must be acknowledged that the vast majority of migrant workers who come here are more skilled than our own population.  Some 50% of migrant workers have a third level qualification compared to one third of our own workers.  Naturally, as the migrants gain English language skills, they will be able to compete for certain jobs.The point I was trying to make to the Minister has been lost, that is, that there is obviously a need to ensure Irish members of the labour force are able to compete for some of the jobs.  If there are jobs being created in the economy, we must ensure everyone has the skills necessary to compete for them.  I do not believe my saying this is racist and I am not trying to be such.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Conor Lenihan, branded me a racist for making those points but it is crucial that we be perceived to have a level playing pitch in respect of competition for jobs.  This works both ways.  In regard to some aspects of the economy, it is a question of migrant workers out-competing the Irish while, in regard to other aspects, it is the other way around.  If a level playing pitch is not put in place, we are opening up a can of worms or what could be a powder keg.  No one wants to see this.Last summer I raised the need for migrants to have language skills.  They have the potential to improve our economic competitiveness if we can tap into their skill base.  The language barrier is a problem for some migrants.  The decision taken by the Minister for Finance before the summer to cut the funding available for language education for adults was disgraceful, as was the cut on budget day affecting migrant children in schools.  The reality is that, over the past two years, we have spent more than €300 million on language training for children in schools, never mind adult language training.  While this policy has not worked and while it needs to be reviewed to ensure proper delivery, the cutting of the resources in this area will not help anyone.  Having cut the budget for language support, the Minister for Finance is wondering why migrants cannot get jobs.  He must get his act together on this issue if we are to deal with it seriously and support the integration of all groups into society.  This not only involves the provision of language skills to migrant workers but also the provision of numeracy and literacy skills and speech and language and resource supports to our own unemployed.  Our children should also be included in this regard as they, too, are left at the back of the classroom.Last September I spoke about the competitiveness of our economy and the potential of migrants to improve it.  I referred to three specific barriers to competitiveness but none has been addressed.  The first is the issue of language training.  The availably of language courses is the issue for many migrants because many ended up joining literacy classes because they could not join language classes through the vocational education committees.The second issue is that of business permission.  If a person from outside the European Union has a good business idea and wants to establish a company here, he cannot do so without going through a very bureaucratic system and obtaining permission from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Instead of basing a decision on the applicant's business idea and the potential to create jobs, the Department asks the applicant to prove he has €300,000 available to him and that he will employ two EU citizens.  There is not an entrepreneur in the country at present who could provide this.  Why are migrants being discriminated against in this regard?  The regulations should not be in place and they pertain to a different era.  I presume they relate to the sale of passports some years ago but surely we have progressed beyond that.The third issue concerns tapping into the skilled labour pool.  Quite a number of migrants in Ireland have third level qualifications but, because they are not recognised here, they cannot gain employment that reflects their skill level.  This is because they may have obtained their third level qualifications outside the European Union.  FETAC and HETAC are involved in recognising the qualifications.I met a young man recently who told me he applied to HETAC to have his third level qualification recognised and was told it was the equivalent of grade 7.  He appealed this and received a letter stating his qualification had been upgraded to grade 8.  Surely this raises concerns.  Why did he not receive a grade 8 in the first instance?  The anomalies in the system need to be addressed.  In tandem, we need to identify and upskill vulnerable workers, regardless of nationality.We need to ensure we properly regulate and enforce employment law.  It is disappointing we do not yet have the full complement of labour inspectors that we should have.  I hope the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will ensure the full complement is appointed.The issue of undocumented workers is of fundamental importance.  I do not refer to illegal workers but to immigrants from outside the European Union who had residency and work permits and contributed to the Irish economy but who, through no fault of their own, fell out of the system and are now undocumented.  Many are in the black economy, which is having an impact on the legal economy in that it is undermining the survival of legitimate businesses that are trying to employ people in an above-board manner.  The black economy is facilitating cowboys and ensuring that the undocumented are exploited.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a commitment in the House 12 months ago that he would introduce a bridging visa to allow those who have become undocumented to have a six-month residency visa to allow them to return to a legal form of employment.I cannot understand the National Employment Rights Authority's double standard regarding the enforcement of employment law.  As far as the authority is concerned, an employer who is exploiting an undocumented worker, or worker with no papers who has entered the country illegally, is not in breach of employment law and will not be prosecuted.As far as NERA is concerned, if one is exploiting an undocumented worker or one who has entered the country illegally and does not have any papers, the employer is not in breach of employment law and will not be prosecuted.  The law needs to change in that regard.  I hope the Minister will ensure that matter is addressed on Committee Stage.  I am aware he received a submission from the Migrant Rights Centre on this issue.  The Minister has met that organisation on many occasions.  It is an advocate in regard to many practices that should not be tolerated in this country but, sadly, are.  It made the point that in the United States undocumented aliens have the exact same rights in regard to labour exploitation as legally resident workers.  In effect, we are facilitating employers who wish to exploit employees who do not have proper documentation and that is undercutting legitimate employers and jobs.I understand the system that operates in the United States also operates in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Spain in the sense that workplace rights are not based on the status of the employee.  I hope the Minister will address the issue on Committee Stage and ensure that employees' rights are protected, regardless of their status.  Otherwise, we are only facilitating the development of a black market sector and undermining legitimate jobs and employers by doing so.  The ESRI study of immigrants at work in the Irish labour market found that there have been significant cases of discrimination against them.  The work permit system is in need of serious examination.  I acknowledge the announcement by the Minister last week during his contribution on Second Stage that he is reviewing the work permit system.  However, that should have been done 12 months ago not now that we are discussing the Bill.  It is vitally important that we examine the matter.The non-transferability of work permits is causing problems.  I refer to the fact that they are specific to the employer.  If an employer lays off an individual that person is, in effect, in limbo.  I came across a case recently that relates to section 54 where a person from outside the European Union who was on a work permit was laid off but he could not get his P45 and redundancy letters from his employer in order to get a new work permit.  Time was running out for him when he came to me.  I pleaded with the employee's accountant to release the documentation.  He explained that the difficulty was that the employer did not have the money to pay the redundancy due to the employee.  The main concern of the employee was to get his documentation.  He could not have cared less about the redundancy payment.  He wanted to submit the documentation to the Department to ensure he could be issued with a new employment permit.  In effect, he had a guillotine hanging over his head while the employer was concerned about another aspect of the matter.That case almost resulted in another person becoming part of the undocumented system or requiring a bridging visa.  The frustrating aspect of the matter is that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform facilitates individuals who seek a temporary visa to allow them to get work but that has not been put on a formalised structure within the Department.  It is 12 months since the commitment by the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, currently Minister for Finance, that such a system would be put in place without further delay.  I urge the Minister to speak to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and expedite that single issue which would bring about a significant reduction in the vulnerability of some of these workers who, inadvertently, are undermining legitimate employment also.I hope the review of the work permit system will encompass the transferability of work permits.  Photographs and headlines concerning some of the Minister's colleagues appeared in newspapers in recent weeks in connection with the number of new work permits issued in the past 12 months.  We must examine how the permits are being issued, who is getting them and whether there are people — either migrants or non-migrants — who could take up some of the vacant positions should they be offered them.  I accept documentation must be provided to support requests for work permits but in the current climate it is difficult to accept that we cannot find people for jobs.  However, some of the positions are specialised ones in the health or IT sectors and we need those people to keep the economy going.Another issue that causes problems for migrant workers is the fact that in many cases, especially at the lower end of the spectrum involving non-skilled or domestic work, accommodation is offered with the job so that if such persons lose their jobs or complain about their employers, potentially they could be out on the street also and have questionable legal status.We need to put in place a fair balance.  We should not hound employers who perhaps have not dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's but concentrate on employers who blatantly exploit people, in many cases purely because of their nationality.  It is vitally important that we deal with such people quickly and make an example of those involved in such cases.Other speakers referred to the cases of the Gama workers and Polish workers employed in Moneypoint.  Legitimate companies in this country have distanced themselves from that practice by employing subcontractors who employ people from outside the European Union at much lower rates and who may not be in compliance with the law.  We need to change the law to ensure the main contractor knows what is going on.  It must be as obvious as the nose on one's face if a subcontractor is coming in with a price that no one can match.An employer recently related an experience to me of where he had tendered for a State contract at cost price.  He cut out everything.  He said it was not physically possible for someone to comply with the law at a lower price than his, but he did not get the contract as somebody was cheaper.  The only way that could be done was through not paying people a fair rate or the going rate.An issue was raised with me about the bureaucracy associated with this area.  I refer to an organisation called EPACE, which is being ring-fenced specifically according to section 45 to carry out policing of the electrical contracting sector.  I have a letter dated approximately 12 months ago from EPACE to an employer who was given eight days to provide a huge volume of documentation to it.  The organisation was established to monitor and ensure compliance with the registered employment agreement for the electrical contracting industry.  I do not know what legislation provided for the establishment of the body.  It is my understanding that it is a private company established by a trade union.  Surely if NERA is good enough to enforce employment law across every other sector within the economy it has the competency to do it within the electrical contracting industry also.  In some way NERA will be accountable to this House through the Minister but it is my understanding that this other organisation will not be accountable to anyone.  I hope the Minister will examine the matter prior to Committee Stage.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I wish to share time with Deputy Calleary.I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation designed by the Government and the social partners to strengthen worker protection, which we all want, particularly in a recession, with many people unemployed or being made redundant while others are not working in the best environment.  We want to make sure employees are treated with respect wherever they work, that they are paid the correct amount and that employers are cognisant of all their duties to their employees.  The statutory footing being provided to NERA, which is based in Carlow in my constituency, is an important step in the enforcement of employment legislation and workers' rights.  NERA has been, and remains, a success and the increased resources for the authority are vital.People are concerned about many workers' issues relating to pay slips, working time and the minimum wage and the authority is in place to monitor employers, to persuade at times and enforce at other times and to initiate legal proceedings, where necessary.  It is staggering that NERA received an additional 20,000 calls last year compared to 2007 and this is testament to the important point of contact it has become for workers with queries about their employment who want to obtain information about the obligations and responsibilities of employers to them.  The new obligations on employers are necessary and welcome, as is the protection provided for whistleblowers.  Where unsavoury practices are taking place in an employment, it is important that whistleblowers are given protection.The punishments outlined for summary offences and convictions are adequate and strong deterrents exist for those considering exploitation of workers.  There has been criticism of the lack of convictions against exploitative employers.  Some of this is justified but the approach of NERA and labour inspectors to the cases they deal with, which is to give employers the opportunity to comply before rushing to file for prosecution, is reasonable and cognisant of the fact that employment law is so vast that employers will not always know the extent of their obligations.  We hope they do not take short cuts but the agency's role is partly to create awareness and to effect change in an approachable manner.  The legislation supports this.One aspect of employment law compliance that must be considered in the context of the Bill is the exploitation of migrant workers and the smuggling of workers into the State without permits.  We have all heard ghastly stories of people working in terrible conditions; in some cases, their accommodation is linked to their jobs and they are afraid to highlight their conditions in case they lose their job and the facility to send money home.  It must be ensured those stories are not replicated in the press.  I hope there will be cross-government cohesion in this area and the Immigration Bill 2008 will, in its final state, complement the spirit of this legislation.  I also hope the law will ensure compassion, sensibility and common sense in dealing with the vulnerable in the labour market, whether workers are here legally or illegally.An important development arising from the new framework is the monitoring of labour market trends, which will be important in assisting the Government to understand changing economic and demographic characteristics in the State.  Understanding the trends better will help us plan for the short, medium and long term with greater precision and coherence, particularly in the context of job losses.  Last week was dreadful in the context of unemployment.The Bill provides us with a timely opportunity to conduct a fundamental review of our employment architecture.  Many agencies are involved in enforcing employment law and employers should get up to speed with them all, including NERA, rights commissioners, the Labour Court, employment appeals tribunals, the Equality Tribunal, the Health and Safety Authority and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs.  All these organisations should dovetail with each other to make sure the best work environment is delivered for employees.  All agencies have a major role in ensuring we are not bedevilled with red tape and we mean business in dealing with the important issue of employees' rights and ensuring employers are familiar with the role they must play in looking after them.This may be a good time for the Government to redefine what each agency does if there are overlaps and duplication and to ensure greater efficiency and streamlining can be achieved in the system without undoing the important regulation and enforcement of workers' rights.  I am hopeful the Bill will do a great deal for workers and encourage employers to get up to speed because NERA is in place to support employees.  Let us create a better work environment, particularly in this deepening recession.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I also welcome the spirit and ethos of the legislation.  The fact that it emerged from the social partnership process demonstrates the model can still work, in spite of the difficult circumstances we are experiencing.  Nobody could disagree with the need to strengthen inspection of workplaces and enforcement of legislation, particularly in light of the more high profile cases involving Irish Ferries and Gama, which led to this necessary legislation.  Equally, however, it is important to recall that 95% of employers operate in a fair manner and in full co-operation with their employees.  Trends and practices have developed over the years, which follow the spirit of legislation and partnership, although they may not strictly adhere to legislation.  It would be dangerous and unfair if the agencies established under the Bill led to such partnership being thrown out.I welcome section 36 because, for the first time, the powers of labour inspectors under various employment statutes have been merged and it is positive to consolidate and broaden them in order that NERA's inspectors have all the powers they need.  While I welcome this section, I am concerned about section 38 and, in particular, the provision that gives the director of the agency the authority to summon an employer to his or her office for cross-examination in a quasi-court setting with oaths and so on being involved.  I appreciate there might be a need to do this but there are ways that can be done in the current judicial system.  Is it necessary to introduce another element of hostility into the system when the Employment Appeals Tribunal and so on can be used to address issues?Many Members, including myself, have received representations about the work of NERA and the way in which a number of inspectors have operated in recent months.  The majority of inspectors have done a great job but the legislation provides for no restriction on the time of inspections other than that it should be reasonable in the view of the inspector.  "Reasonable" is not 9 p.m. on a Saturday in a busy restaurant in the middle of the tourism season or at peak times when employers are trying to keep their businesses going.  Employers with something to hide will do so at any time.  The majority of those who have nothing to hide will make their records available at appropriate times and this provision should be re-examined.Deputy Naughten referred to EPACE.  It is important that the role of this organisation be clarified.  Who is involved?  Is it a private company with shareholdings, as in the unions?  If so, why has it such an important role and authority?  Could these be subsumed into NERA?I commend the Minister of State on his work in recent weeks and months on the JLC issue, particularly in the catering sector.  That system was allowed to continue for decades but it is completely outdated in a modern economy.  This has impacted on the ability of people to work and businesses to employ in recent months.  I commend the Minister of State on the speedy action he took and I hope he will bring the issue to a resolution before long.The Government is committed to reducing the red tape burden on businesses by 25%.  This burden is costing jobs.  We are not absolving people of their rights.  However, there are more efficient ways to proceed.  At some point I would like to see a regulatory impact assessment of the Bill.  What additional red tape will be involved from the perspectives of both employers and employees?  It is often the employees who get hit.  The less red tape we have, the better.One of the Bill's aims is to foster increased co-operation in the workplace.  However, we need to be very careful.  We often do things in this House with good intentions and then pass the ball to an external agency such as we are creating in this case.  Our good intentions tend to be enacted in very different ways.  Fostering co-operation in the workplace means protecting jobs.  However, it also means protecting good employers.  I would say that 95% of employers in the country are good reputable people.  We do not need to criminalise them.

I hope this principle would be accepted across all sides of the House and particularly by all spokespersons.  The principle is that all workers have an unequivocal right to be free and protected from exploitation.  That right should not be conditional on one's status.  It should be capable of being vindicated and should not be conditional on economic circumstances.  If it is made conditional on one's status, it is not a labour right in the fullest sense.  If it is made conditional on conditions in the economy, it is a camouflage.I intend to speak in support of the Bill, in the full knowledge that the Government side and our side have tabled amendments to improve the legislation, which will happen.  I regret that Deputy Varadkar has said he does not intend to support the Bill and suggested in a fit of hubris that in Government he would repeal the legislation, which would require his party having a majority because it would not have the support of my party.Lest it be mentioned afterwards, I wish to state that one of my sons, who is a human rights graduate, works as an intern for the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland.  While my views are my own, my son has worked on providing documentation for a number of cases.I have listened carefully to the contributions that have been made.  This legislation is being introduced to protect labour rights.  I have a position that is broader than this.  I regularly ask the Government — I believe I have asked five times — when it proposes to ratify the United Nations Convention on Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1990 and which came into being as a legal instrument internationally on 1 July 2003.  I am not sure whether any countries in the European Union have yet ratified the convention.  The usual answer is that sufficient protections for migrant workers exist within domestic legislation.  I disagree with that.  It would be in everybody's interest to have the international instrument implemented.I wish to say something that is also interesting to me — I have been around for long enough to be able to say it.  One of the most successful appointments we made to the position of European Commissioner was that of the late President, Dr. Patrick Hillery.  He led the case.  It was one of the distinguished contributions he made but is insufficiently noted.  He took the first steps at European Union level to establish rights for all workers and all migrants.  I remember discussing it and contrasting his contribution in favour of workers with that of the undistinguished current occupant who is in favour of regulation with a light touch.It is extraordinary that people speak about this legislation as if it is introduced as some form of discomfiture to employers or will somehow be of some disability to them.  The opposite is the case.  The majority of employers are good employers and have nothing to fear from good legislation.  They have nothing to fear from all workers being equally protected.  If one wants to go down that road, it is probably one of the great bulwarks of proper competitiveness to be dealing on a level playing field.  I cannot understand people riding two horses in this regard.People have referred to the new circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I would be a fool if I did not recognise what is staring me in the face, which is the attempt by many people to use the present economic conditions to introduce a version of competitiveness that would result in a low-wage economy.  That would be correctly opposed tooth and nail by anyone in favour of fair working conditions.  We can have an opportunity on Committee State to review the Bill in some detail.Before Christmas we got a presentation from the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland that gave descriptions of people working more than 75 hours and being paid €2 an hour.  In addition, even where decisions have been made in favour of the worker, it is often very difficult to get the money from the employer.  It is not simply a case of Irish people exploiting migrant workers who come from outside Ireland or the European Union.  Many of the migrants are facing oppression from the country from which they came.  Some have paid people for their job — paid to be exploited.  When they raise the issue with the person who has exploited them, sanctions are sometimes visited on their families, extended families and communities back in their country of origin.  We need to realise that what we are doing should form part of an international pattern.  A worker's status should not be a condition of recognising his or her fundamental right to be protected as a worker.I do not agree that it is an unfair imposition on the employer to ask for documentation.  I read the section to which speakers have referred.  The employer has the right to be accompanied by a solicitor, member of the legal profession or a member of a professional organisation.  Equally on the other side the worker has the right to be accompanied by a trade union official and so on.  There are ways in which we can refine all of this.  I listened with care and read the letters that I received regarding the Employment Permits Acts because it seems that if NERA is to be vindicated, it is hard to argue that the one agency should not work across the board.  This is a matter to which we can return on Committee Stage.I have a difficulty with some other parts of the legislation.  I do not believe all 81 inspectors in NERA should be asked to fulfil functions that are aspects of the immigration authority's functions.  The GNIB has a number of difficulties in cleaning up its operation.  It should do what the GNIB is supposed to do.  I am not throwing out any aside about the GNIB, but I believe there is total confusion on the specificity of what it seeks.  For example, when it comes to proof of identity, what document is acceptable?  It is sometimes suggested that a person should have a document of the status of a passport or equivalent, that they should leave the jurisdiction and renew one that is out of date, and that a utility bill or a driving licence is not acceptable.  This is all nonsense and it is only a matter of time until the courts make a strong ruling on that matter.At the moment there is a vigilante interpretation of that rule.  I would like to see the labour inspectorate with statutory powers under the legislation.  I am willing to take a benign view.  We will see in the fullness of time how successful the legislation has been.  The view that everything can be solved in the workplace is a benign version of what takes place.  We must wait and see how it works out.I wish to see certain omissions in the Bill addressed on Committee Stage.  I refer to the specific measures that should fall on repeat offenders.  I am sure when the full reports come from the inspectorates they will show a considerable amount of recidivism on the part of those who are offenders in this regard.  With regard to the documentation sought, we should ask for more specificity on Committee Stage, particularly with regard to the information sought.  I refer to dates, hours worked, specific rates, access to overtime and so forth.  This would all help.I welcome the introduction of legislation which is not aimed at making anything more difficult in economic terms or anything more discomfiting for employers but creates a framework of labour rights and compliance.  It is a commitment in Towards 2016 which may need amendment but I am happy to support it.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I welcome the Bill.  It is unfortunate that it took two and a half years to come before the House from the time of the Gama and Irish Ferries debacles.  I welcome the stated intention of the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to have an open attitude and that he will consider carefully constructive amendments from this side of the House.  I welcome his attitude.  I hope other Ministers follow suit.I should declare to the House that I am an employer but I am also my party's spokesperson on workers' rights so I am wearing a couple of hats in this debate.  In our operation at home, we do not regard it as a case of worker versus employer or the other way round.  In our view, the development of a culture of teamwork is important and this is also important in Leinster House or in any place where there is work to be done.  It is much better to achieve teamwork and harmony and a good working relationship as this results in a more constructive approach and better productivity.  I echo the words of the two previous speakers in that I believe the vast majority of employers are fairly decent people who are trying to achieve a reasonable objective and have no intention of exploiting workers.Unfortunately, confrontational attitudes exist.  These attitudes go back centuries but some of them can be traced back to Thatcher and Reagan and the tone that was set internationally when those two monsters were in office on either side of the Atlantic.  It is unfortunate that this attitude took hold and became currency and we can see the fruits of it now in our banking system.This legislation will protect good employers.  In the absence of this type of legislation, people will undercut and will breach the minimum wage rates and breach all sorts of employee rights in order to become more competitive but on an uneven playing field.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, has made substantial moves to bring about a level playing pitch.  I hope that a culture of compliance can be achieved because such a culture is crucial to developing the harmony we all want to see in the workplace.I refer to the lack of prosecutions.  NERA has recorded a total of 2,334 breaches of employment law with one prosecution in 2007.  In 2008, some 4,629 breaches were detected.  Despite the number of prosecutions increasing to 80, this is still a tiny proportion of what was found, at less than 0.2% of the violations of employment legislation.  This is a concern.  It may be that NERA is adopting a softly-softly approach in its early days in order to become established.  If this is the case, I hope it will have a step change fairly quickly and up the ante to try and deal with these wayward employers who are clearly in breach.We all know that proceeding to prosecution is a very bureaucratic and costly endeavour.  I will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with this.  I suggest a scheme of on-the-spot fines for some of the minor breaches.  It would not be too difficult to work out the minutiae of such a scheme.  It could be a scheme to ensure there are proper wages slips or proper documentation on display within the work premises.  Such a scheme would ensure the inspectors could work more speedily and effectively in those minor cases.  If an employer were found to be in breach of more serious matters and ended up in court, the judge could take cognisance of the earlier breaches which had been dealt with by way of on-the-spot fines.  It is important to facilitate the inspectors by allowing them deal with these breaches in that way.Other speakers referred to undocumented workers and this issue is also of great concern to me.  While the issue has been elaborated by others, I will not develop it substantially but suffice to say I am concerned that undocumented workers have no rights at all.  This is an area which needs to be dealt with in this legislation and we must provide for those people.Another section of workers of concern to me are the domestic workers.  While this issue has been discussed in previous debates, it is very difficult to reach these people because they tend to be isolated.  They are like the servants of old in that they are ensconced in a private house and are hidden away and may not have access to the information they require in order to be able to substantiate their rights and entitlements.A number of other areas are also of concern.  At the recent launch of NERA's campaign, one employer said she did not know the proper rates nor had she proper information about employment rights.  There is need for a publicity campaign in order to make employers and employees aware of the information at hand.  This could be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners or some such avenue.  This might be more cost-effective than a big media campaign.  A publicity campaign is required to make people more aware of their responsibilities.  I took that employer at face value on the day and she sounded genuine.  People who are new to enterprise and new to employment situations require some enhanced information.Will the Minister of State consider having NERA publish in multiple languages a series of the various documents required in the workplace and making them available to employers at cost price?  This would enhance people's knowledge of their responsibilities.While I welcome section 26, which requires that a report shall be sent to the Minister annually, could the report be laid before both Houses?  This would be a useful addition to the Bill.  I have dealt with the notices on domestic workers, a matter that I hope the Minister of State will consider.Compliance with registered employment agreements, REAs, is another issue, but I do not know why it is such a concern for some employers.  REAs are arrived at by consensus between workers' representatives and employers.

People should stop whingeing about something that has already been agreed.Some people are making the case that the Bill is an additional burden on employers, but I do not believe that for one moment.  Why would employers not have proper documentation for workers?  Since there is no excuse for not having any, it is not an extra burden.  There is no reason for employers being unable to display the notices required under the Bill.  I hope that we can move to a situation in which employers would accept their responsibilities and get on with them, thus providing a level playing field for everyone in the sector.

Not only is it being introduced at the worst possible time, it contradicts everything that we as a Government should be doing for the honest, decent and hard-working business people in this time of economic crisis.I will attempt to outline just a few of my issues with the Bill and begin with the most obvious, namely, the setting up of a board called the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, on a statutory basis.  At a time when we are attempting to reduce the number of quangos, the Bill will introduce a new one.  When we should be reducing the number of directors, we will put a new one in place.In its short existence since its establishment on a non-statutory basis, NERA has earned itself a reputation for using strong, bully boy tactics, barging in on hard-working business people late in the evening and during their busiest periods, often as late as 10 p.m., and demanding to see their books in the middle of busy functions when their secretarial staff might not be available.  Often, the owner-manager is the secretary.  We need to support our small indigenous firms, not allow them to be treated like criminals by officials who do not know what it is like to run a small business while trying to make ends meet.  I know what it is like to run a small business and to work through all of the extra worries and pressures that come with it.  Many of the businesses in question are run by families.The Bill will add more worries to those already struggling businesses and put an end to small businesses, entrepreneurs and any hope of job creation.  It will create 23 new criminal offences with a maximum fine not exceeding €250,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to three years.  Why would a business owner or manager in his or her right mind want to become subject to 23 new criminal offences?  As Deputies have commented, most business people and employers are honest and hard-working and abide by current legislation.  While we will always have a minority of rogue employers who exploit workers, we are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.As a Government, we should be focusing more on encouraging business owners and helping them with their struggles without punishing them and putting them under unnecessary extra burdens.  We need our business people to focus not only on surviving, but on becoming more competitive instead of worrying about paying their employees untenable wages on a Sunday to satisfy an employment regulation order.  Regarding the order, I compliment the Minister of State on his efforts in negotiating with many people and on his work in trying to level the playing field between Dublin and the rest of the country.We all acknowledge employees' rights and the need for legislation in this area, but that legislation is already in place under the provisions of a number of different Acts and has served the State and employees well by being strong during times of need.  Under the legislation, officials are empowered to visit businesses and many people who were doing wrong or exploiting others rightly ended up in court.  There must be a balance between employee and employer rights, but the Bill is out of balance.  We should encourage employers and employees to work together to survive these rough times, not drive a wedge between them, which I believe the Bill will do.I appeal to the Minister of State to refrain from introducing the Bill.  We are putting ourselves more and more at risk of over-regulating and scaring away any foreign industries that may want to consider Ireland as a place in which to invest or any indigenous entrepreneurs who want to go into business.  The Bill, which is aimed at protecting employees, will do the complete opposite.  It will put them out of work because businesses will not be able to afford the new costs and will not want to risk taking on new employees.  Too often, we only realise that we have got something wrong when it is too late.  It is not yet too late to re-examine what we are doing.NERA has existed on an interim basis since 2007 and we can already see the damage and trauma that it is causing.  We have witnessed many hotels and other catering outlets cease Sunday trading as a result of their strict enforcement of the hotel employment regulation orders.  It is not too late to put an end to this, but it will be much more difficult to stop NERA after it has been put on a statutory basis.The Bill has got it wrong and it is not the time to focus on these matters.  I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to park it and to stop wasting our time focusing on legislating small businesses out of business.  Instead, we should focus on supporting those businesses and getting ourselves out of our current situation.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I am happy to speak on this Bill.  While I will table my concerns, I am in favour of the legislation's total cast and its intention.Over the years, the trade union movement, which we delightfully like to call our social partners, has sought the codification and rationalisation of all of the measures accruing to it.  We do not hear anything afterwards.  The unions demand and get the measures, but when those measures are run to excess, it is left to us to pick up the pieces.In this Bill and during the launch of a report, the Minister of State played up the role of an organisation called NERA.  With tongue in cheek, I praise NERA's utter zeal in descending upon people at 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. and demanding to see their books, demanding to know who they are employing, demanding and demanding and demanding while the proprietors and their staff try to keep their businesses open and to make some money.  I am in favour of people being zealous and committed to their jobs.  In this case, however — not even tongue in cheek — I cannot commend the type of zeal that leads to the complete harassment of people.I wish to recount a story that I have already related to the Minister of State.  I also have been in correspondence with him but have got nowhere.  Perhaps I will, but this issue has been dragged out for a long time.  A small rural restaurant, of the type with which the Acting Chairman will be familiar, was set up in south County Westmeath.  It is adjacent to, but not part of, a pub, which is run by the pub's owners.  I expect the operators of the restaurant part of the building took out a kind of franchise or whatever.  In any event, they run a lovely and highly interesting rural restaurant that is beautifully appointed, with good cuisine of good quality.  However, people from NERA descended upon them.  As the restaurant only opens five days a week, the owners fondly understood that Sunday would be one of their five days, in which case they would operate on Sundays in the same fashion on their other open days, namely, from Wednesday to Saturday.  The restaurant did not open on Monday or Tuesday.  The restaurant is located five miles from both Athlone and Moate and, therefore, those who wish to have a nice time and a treat there must either take taxis or nominate some poor outsider to be their driver for the night.The restaurant owners were told they were obliged to pay double time on Sundays, which is extraordinary.  The staff who worked in the restaurant told the proprietor that while they did not want double time, they did want their jobs.  I do not know what the Minister of State intends to do in this regard.  It is quite the most ridiculous situation I have ever heard of.  The workers emphasised that they wanted their jobs, which they loved.  They were earning some money, were getting a few decent tips and wished to keep their jobs.  However, they were informed that they must get and take double time.  Consequently, the restaurant, which was not going to keep that up, closed.  If it has not closed, such extraordinary carry-on has brought it close to closure.  Equally, no hotel in Athlone now offers Sunday lunch because of double time.  However, I understand that in the city of Dublin, and perhaps in Cork, the rate for Sunday trading is time and one third.  The Minister of State has assured me this is correct.I had the Minister of State's job for three years and never came across anything as extraordinarily stupid as this.  I do not understand the reason some outdated joint labour committees, JLCs, which were set up in 1931 or some extraordinarily long time ago, are still sitting.  Moreover, there has been no change to their operations or functions.  I fault the representatives of both employers and employees who have allowed matters to continue in this ridiculous fashion.  Why should time and one third apply in the city of Dublin while double time applies in rural Westmeath and elsewhere, as well as urban Athlone and Mullingar?  There is no longer a  raison d’être for such carry-on, because of the many subsequent innovations, such as rights commissioners, various tribunals, labour services and so on ad nauseam.  Then, plunged into the middle of this, came the prima donnas from NERA.  These men and women decided they would come in the dead of night to scare the bejasus out of both the employers and the employees, to force double time down their necks and tell the former that if they do not give it, NERA will close them.As I said at the outset, I am all for this legislation.  It contains many good things and I am in favour of a good spirit between employers and employees.  That is the way I have lived my life.  Although I really enjoyed having responsibility for labour affairs, on completion of this Bill, unless the Minister of State succeeds in fixing this issue, he will have been a failure in his job.  I am making this point plainly because why should the people put up with such nonsense?  This is a total nonsense.  Is NERA only able to go around the country with jackboots and an overbearing attitude to people?  While I am sure that in ordinary life each man and woman in NERA is a decent bloke or woman, they are not when they are exercising this stupid regulation.  The Minister of State simply should get rid of the outdated JLCs, which bear no relation to everyday life or to what now passes for decent living in Ireland.There is no incentive for anyone to set up a business or restaurant when the rates one must pay are stuffed down one's neck on pain of closure.  Moreover, the manner in which NERA conducts its business is highly ominous.  While I took the opportunity to speak in the Chamber today simply to discuss this issue, I am tired of doing so.  I raised it at a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting approximately six months ago but nothing has happened.  While I received several letters, and I thank the Minister of State for his courtesy, nothing came out of the letters and the same carry-on continues.  Perhaps NERA will take on more duties that will make it somewhat busier and it would make a great change were it to pester someone else for a while.  However, the next thing I wish to hear from the Minister of State is an end to time and one third in Dublin and double time in County Westmeath.The Minister of State should outline exactly what he intends to do about this issue in his response.  Members of the parliamentary party have been driven daft with it.  It is a topic that keeps arising and about which Members continue to hear.  I understand exactly the points made by Deputy Mattie McGrath.  Lest Opposition Members lose the run of themselves, this does not betoken opposition to trade unions or decent wages on the part of Fianna Fáil Members, or that they are in favour of exploitation — far from it.  How could one be in favour of exploitation when those who are receiving the wages have stated that they do not want double time but do want their jobs?  It is called common sense in the year 2009 and I hope someone is listening.

I have been in this House for a long time and have always tried to be moderate in my approach to legislation and to affairs in the House.  However, I feel like raising the flag of revolution about legislation of this nature.  Are Members living in the real world?  Has the Government lost touch with reality?The House is now in the process of pushing through legislation to establish 23 criminal offences to both persecute and prosecute employers.  Members do so against a backdrop of an unemployment level that, according to the Taoiseach the other day, is heading towards 400,000 people, although that may be an underestimate.  Are Members out of their minds?  They are on course to establish a situation in which employers will become an endangered species.  We should treasure the employers we have and should encourage new ones.  We will never get out of the economic travails we face unless we adopt such an approach.  As for this ridiculous approach of introducing legislation to hit employers on the head with a sledgehammer for not putting up notices and so on, are Members out of their minds?I wish to address, in the strongest possible terms, a plea to the Government to get real.  While Members wish to ensure that workers are not exploited, a raft of agencies already exists to ensure this does not happen.  I refer to the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, rights commissioners, the Equality Tribunal and other tribunals, the Health and Safety Authority and the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, all of which have a role to play in ensuring that workers are not exploited.  We have a multitude of agencies and what we should combine their functions under a single agency.The inspectors should operate under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and should be allowed to deal with complaints as they arise.  As for setting up a formal agency, I was about to call it Nero's agency but it is called NERA.  Its sole purpose, as far as I can see, is to eliminate employers.  It simply does not make sense.  I have been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for some time.  Recent meetings of that committee have opened our eyes to what goes on in some State boards.  I hope the report we publish tomorrow on events at FÁS will open many more people's eyes.The interim board of the National Employment Rights Authority has been established and already there is evidence of empire-building.  The headquarters are in Carlow and I have no particular objection to that location.  However, I see from the report that the Minister launched some days ago that the authority has already spread its tentacles throughout the State, with regional offices established in Dublin, Cork, Sligo and Shannon.  Each of these five facilities supports separate staffs.Another proud boast of the Government is that the labour inspectorate has been increased from 50 to 80.  Is the Government living in the real world?

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I am concerned at the attitude of a Government that proudly trots out yet another agency of this type.  I read the review the Minister launched with great fanfare some weeks ago.  It included no balance sheets or costings and no indication of staff numbers.  I discovered in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill that we are talking about a figure in the order of €14 million or €15 million.  However, there is no exact figure.  I will pursue this matter through the Committee of Public Accounts and otherwise.  Spending €14 million or €15 million on setting up this agency is unacceptable when all that is required is the appointment of additional inspectors to the Department.  That would have done the job in a manner that is reasonable to those who are trying to maintain their businesses.  That is far preferable to descending on such persons in the darkness of night to persecute them.What a worker needs above all is work.  However, we are in the process of introducing legislation that may curtail the availability of employment.  Our entire approach in this crisis should be to find incentives to work and to encourage employers, that endangered species, to take on more employees.  We should not be imposing a cost on the public purse in introducing measures that will persecute employers.We do not need another statutory agency, nor do we need the interim agency.  It is entirely unnecessary and out of kilter with the needs of our time.  Moreover, the Bill provides for the establishment of an advisory board with representatives of employers, employees and the Minister.  This resonates with the situation at FÁS.  We certainly should not look to that particular board as an example of how a State body should be run.Holding out to employers the prospect of a fine of up to €250,000 and imprisonment for three years as a consequence of breaking employment law is not the way we should proceed in the current climate.  The message from this House, if not from the Government, should be to encourage employment.  We must offer assurances that we want to see people working and that we will ensure in a sensible, moderate and reasoned way that there will be sufficient departmental inspectors to ensure workers are not exploited.  The message should be that we will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that but we will not set up this new empire which represents a waste of taxpayers' money and may ultimately serve only to squash employment.The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, is a genuine, decent Cork man.  I urge him to focus on the actions he can take to encourage employment.  Will he ask his Government colleagues to face reality instead of pushing for the establishment of another unnecessary quango?  Will he seek to rectify the ridiculous situation of pubs, restaurants and hotels being obliged to close on Sundays, as eloquently highlighted by Deputy O'Rourke?  Why is there not urgent action to remedy this situation?  I have spoken to employers who are pleading to open for business on Sundays and whose employees are eager to work.  It is absurd that they cannot do so.There are other areas in which we can encourage development.  The word "developer" is a dirty word these days.  I am of the view that developers who properly develop do a good job for the State.  However, there is a difficulty with our planning laws.  For example, An Bord Pleanála is supposed to complete planning appeals within 18 weeks but a recent report indicates that only 25% are disposed of within that timeframe.  We should remove the obstacles to development and employment.  This is not to argue for lower planning standards, but to encourage those involved in the process to do the job as prescribed for them by this House.We should not prescribe this type of legislation.  If there is €15 million to spare, it should be allocated to a more worthy cause.  The Minister of State is aware of efforts to get the Cork-Swansea ferry up and running.  An allocation of €2 million would allow it to commence operation, thus providing employment and helping to win back some of the tourists we have lost.  That is the type of project that should be prioritised rather than wasting money on operations of the type proposed in this Bill.I urge the Minister of State and his colleagues to stand back for a moment.  They must make a realistic assessment of the situation throughout the State.  If they come out of their ivory towers for a moment, they will see the wreckage and devastation wrought by the collapse of the economy.  The first step in the Government's efforts to encourage employment should be to put this Bill in cold storage.  Second, the National Employment Rights Authority should be given a long holiday.

The Government should abandon this Bill because it does precisely the opposite.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the employment law compliance Bill.  Like every Member of the House, I have mixed views on this legislation.  I am taken by the last paragraph in the explanatory memorandum: "In summary, the Bill is intended to benefit low-paid and other vulnerable employees in particular, by securing vindication of their employment-related rights: this should have clear benefits in terms of alleviating poverty and preventing exploitation and distortion of competition from non-compliance with employment legislation, and generally improving relations in the workplace."  This is all very noble but it is a total contradiction of the contents of the Bill.  I support the reading of this Bill on Second Stage on the basis of two reasons.  One, that it will be totally emasculated on Committee Stage——

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	544	——two, if the legislation makes it out of the House in a reasonable period, any commencement orders for the majority of sections should be held off for as long as possible until economic reality prevails.We all know why this employment rights organisation was set up.  We heard about Gama and about people not being paid properly and the various investigations under way.  When the Irish economy was booming, there was certainly abuse.  Many Irish and non-Irish workers were not paid what they were entitled to.  I do not refer to the minimum wage but rates that prevailed in the construction industry at the time.  People did not receive these rates and there was abuse.  These matters were investigated and people are much wiser.  There are many statutory bodies, agencies and resources of the Department to investigate these matters.  The idea was to set up an agency, and this was done with a budget of some €14 million.  Then it was decided to put the agency on a statutory footing.  This occurred a few years ago but times have changed.  The reality of the economic situation has changed.  I do not refer only to the downturn in the national finances but to the whole perspective of Irish people.I have never seen such a negative item of legislation.  Almost every sentence in the explanatory memorandum is out to do an employer or someone.  If the Department is producing legislation, it should be about promoting employment, but this is guaranteed to lose employment.  The activities of NERA have cost more people their jobs than assisted people in getting their rights in recent months.  I speak from practical experience of cases I have heard about.  We all know of hotels and restaurants which have stopped serving lunches on Sundays.  This is a mishmash.JLCs are part of the core problem.  I accept that NERA has a job to do, that it was given a brief by the Oireachtas and this is the statutory legislation for the agency.  I have never spoken directly to the agency but I know people involved in it.  It is close to my constituency as I live quite close to Carlow.  I have refrained from raising this matter because the obvious answer is that the agency is only implementing what it was told to do by the Government.  This is the case, but much of what we are dealing with is so minute and detailed that we need perspective.  Having been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, one must see the introduction of this legislation, setting up the agency on an interim basis and then passing the legislation for the statutory existence of the agency as a project.  When a project takes a number of years, the first thing one must do is to have a built-in review mechanism and ask whether the objective on the first day is still valid.  Times change and I do not believe this legislation will pass that test if there is a review.  It was initiated with good intentions and was needed when it was introduced, but it is not needed now.I listened to a taxi driver on national radio during the week.  There may be all sorts of innuendo behind this.  He had a matchbox-sized Irish flag on the taxi sign on his roof.  An inspector from the taxi regulator told him he would be prosecuted if he did not take down the matchbox-sized flag.  He said that he was Irish and asked what was wrong with it.  If we have regulatory authorities, such as the taxi regulator, with staff to do this, then we have lost the plot.  I would prefer to see resources in such a Department made available for training those who are stranded someway through an apprentice programme rather than in situations as I have outlined.  This concept must be reconsidered.We have had good discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, who inherited this legislation.  The agency was part of the Department before he was appointed.  People referred to new legislation and new quangos.  An authority has been set up by statute, a director is being set up by statute and advisory boards are set up by statute.  I question why these cannot be done by the main Department.I have a bee in my bonnet about JLCs.  They should all be dissolved for the following reason.  Somebody somewhere meets intermittently in order to set a rate, which goes to the Labour Court, which has a mechanism for dealing with it.  I was contacted by employers at several hotels and restaurants in my constituency in south Leinster.  Perhaps we are unfortunate to be within driving distance of the NERA headquarters in Carlow.  None of these employers had heard of the JLCs and none of them knew they had a representative on it.  I do not believe the employers who participate in JLCs are representative of the people they purport to represent.  They are a fraud.  They are not operating in a democratic manner.I am equally critical on the other side of the equation.  I do not want to single out any trade union.  The ballpark figure for the Irish workforce is 2 million, of which 300,000 people are in the public sector.  All of these are unionised and the total number of unionised staff in Ireland is 600,000.  Over 1.7 million people are in the private sector and some 300,000 of them are in a union.  This means that over 80% of the workforce in the private sector are not in a union.  Unions do not have any mandate to represent an organisation where the majority have little or no membership.  The employer side of the JLCs is unrepresentative of who they purport to represent and the union representatives are equally unrepresentative because they are not their members.  The JLCs process is a fraud and should be declared null and void.I refer to the idea of these groups of people making recommendations to the Labour Court.  It would be different if employers in hotels and restaurants had been in contact with representatives and had attended regional or national executive meetings.  None of the hotel and restaurant employers knew who was the regional representative on the JLCs.  People have got into positions, are sitting there and they are getting rights.  There are remnants of FÁS attached to this, where there are tripartite advisory boards, soft handed jobs for IBEC, ICTU and a few people in the Departments.  These people sit in the quango but they are not elected or representative.  We must be careful about new tripartite bodies because they are not as representative as they purport to be.I would prefer to see more accountability of this organisation to the Oireachtas.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, section 25 is hopelessly insufficient.  This section is the standard section written by those setting up bodies by Departments to ensure there is no accountability to the House.Section 25(1) states:The Director shall, whenever required to do so by—(a) a committee appointed by either House of the Oireachtas, or(b) a committee appointed jointly by both Houses of the Oireachtas,the business of which committee includes examination of policy relating to employment legislation, attend before such committee to discuss his or her general activities.The word "accountability" does not appear in that.  If we are setting up bodies such as this, the director of such organisations must be made in law what we all understand a Secretary General to be — the Accounting Officer.  The buck should stop with him or her, but it does not as this stands.  He or she is only required to attend to "discuss general activities".  That is not reporting; it is a con job that makes little of this House if that is all a committee can do.Section 25(2) indicates that the director should not discuss any information relating to a specific inquiry or do anything to express a comment on the policies of the Government or Minister of the day.  The attendance of the director will not even amount to a talking shop and there will be no accountability.  With FÁS, the Committee of Public Accounts found it could not name an individual because there was no Accounting Officer.  There is a beautiful term out there where a public servant is called an "accountable officer" rather than the Accounting Officer.  It is a new phrase heard in this building recently.  I do not know what it means but I know it means nothing, as it does not amount to an Accounting Officer.There is no accountability to this House by the director, so the person will be able to act unilaterally and come here to discuss general issues.  I am not satisfied because there is no accountability in that.  We should not set this up but if we must set up some of these bodies, the accountable officer should be made accountable and personally responsible to the House not just for doing his or her duties, but in the case where he or she does not carry out his or her duties.If we have learned anything in public life in the past few months, it is that people can walk out of the public service with grand payments that are driving the country mad.  Such people may not have done anything wrong or illegal, but they may not have done their job either.  There should be a requirement in the legislation that the director do the required job.  I consider not doing one's job — malfeasance or whatever — as serious as doing a job badly.  There is no requirement in the legislation for the director to do the job to an acceptable standard but we should learn a lesson from recent times.There will be different views on this legislation but all new bodies should be subject to freedom of information provisions from the start.  It puts in place a proper culture of accountability for actions.  Those in the organisation should know from the first day that they will be made account for their actions under the Freedom of Information Act.  There is no suggestion in the legislation that it will happen in this case and that seems to be the format.  Perhaps people do not like freedom of information and it may suit the system, but it would help make an organisation a little more open in its work if the people in it knew they would be subject to the Freedom of Information Act as well.I am here after months of frustration hearing about this National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, in Carlow.  I had not paid much heed to it until I started getting phone calls from various hotels and restaurants.  These businesses wanted to operate on Sundays with employees who wanted to work on the weekends.  They may have been students who wanted work for Saturdays and Sundays and were happy to work for €10 or €12 per hour.  Some JLC, which neither the employer nor the employee knew about, dictated that certain persons cannot be employed at certain times.  NERA's job is to enforce that legislation, which has caused enormous difficulty.I was in a restaurant last Saturday night — St. Valentine's night — for a quiet meal with my wife but the restaurateur rightly took advantage of me being on the premises to give me a lecture about NERA.  Only a few weeks earlier some of its representatives had arrived on the premises at approximately 8.45 p.m on a Saturday when the entire restaurant was full.  The inspector told the head chef and proprietor that food could not be served until she had finished her paperwork.  For 45 minutes the manager had to go around plying people with drink trying to ameliorate them.  He explained there were inspectors on the premises and assured customers there was nothing wrong and the food was safe.  He was not allowed budge until the paperwork was cleared.  That was on the busiest night of the week.Another hotel in Laois specialises in Saturday weddings, with some dragging on until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. on the Sunday morning.  The NERA inspectors came and although no staff would be brought in on a Sunday — the hotel does not do Sunday lunches — they wanted to check the Saturday records to see who came in for the wedding on a Saturday afternoon but had not left the premises by midnight.  They wanted to see the records of those people on the premises at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. on Sunday, although there was no further work.  The employer had no option but to pay up and staff who had left long before had to be contacted and told they were due a refund.In another restaurant in Portlaoise, the lady who runs it has a great interest in people with disabilities, if I can put it that way.  As she was friendly with two people who were on a disability allowance, she employed them on a part-time basis for rehabilitative purposes.  These people have Down's syndrome and were able to clean tables — I have a sister with Down's syndrome and there is nothing wrong with that.  The people in question worked to their ability and were not allowed handle hot water, tea or saucepans because they were incapable of doing so.  NERA instructed her to pay these people the full rate or they had to leave her employment; the lady in question was almost obliging the people by giving them whatever payment they were getting.Those two people with Down's syndrome had outlets for a couple of hours for two or three days in the week, doing a bit of work which made them feel worthwhile in their lives.  They were deprived of this by NERA, which does not care about such issues.  Perhaps it is the job of the organisation not to care.  Our job as legislators is to ensure that we do not create legislation which facilitates this, as the body only implements legislation.I do not normally criticise Government legislation to this extent but times have changed.  I do not want people to think I am not in favour of employees getting a fair rate — I am all in favour of that.  However, in the current climate, I would like to see the emphasis of everybody involved in setting up NERA working towards the creation of employment rather than over-regulating compliance.There are a number of other aspects of the legislation that I will mention.  I know it is standard practice in legislation that when a director leaves a public sector office, they cannot take up a position in the private sector for 12 months following cessation of appointment in case of conflict of interest.  There are mixed views on this, but such a provision enshrines in legislation that the public sector is one thing and the private sector is another, and we dare not have proper cross-over and cross-fertilisation of good practices in both sides.  Having legislation which dictates that when a director leaves a public sector job, he or she cannot contemplate taking a job in the private sector in the foreseeable future almost indicates that those in the public sector are above working in the private sector.I know there can be conflicts of interest but part of the problem is there is too much demarcation between the public and private sectors.  Most families in Ireland have public and private sector workers and they get on, yet we continue to enshrine this demarcation line in legislation.  It is unnecessary and perpetuates a difference in opinion between public and private sector.I mentioned earlier the question of advisory boards for Ministers but I do not know why we need such an advisory board if we are to have a board of the agency.  It is a duplication to which I cannot see a benefit.Part 5 of the legislation has a provision for legal protection of those people who make a complaint in good faith.  It is indicated that is an offence for anybody to report in bad faith.  Perhaps there is a shortcut in the explanatory note but there appears to be details of penalties for the protection of people but I do not see any penalties for people reporting in bad faith.  Will NERA be as diligent in prosecuting employees with bad-faith reports to the agency as it is with employers?

#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The purpose of this Bill is to establish NERA on a statutory footing and the Minister has consistently stated that it does not need a statutory basis to carry out its full functions. Studying this Bill, I would equate the National Employment Regulatory Authority with another body that was recently established, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  I have a pet name for the employees of this body, ninjas, and this is another body that will employ more ninjas.They do not have to announce any visit.  I do not eat out as often as Deputy Fleming but, as he pointed out, when he was in a restaurant, they came in and demanded paperwork, leading customers to think there was something wrong with the food.  These people have enough powers.  When the authority was initially established, there were 13 employees but that rose to 90.  Those are probably the only jobs this Government has created since it came into office.  In doing so, it is making life miserable for employers.There have been calls here for the Government to do something about the property market, but the Taoiseach has told us consistently that the property market will find its own floor.  At present, there are more than 300,000 people unemployed, a figure that is expected to rise to 500,000 by the end of the year.  Employment will find its own floor.  I have seen the businesses in my constituency that are closed on Sundays or have closed completely because of regulation and red tape that makes employers feel like criminals.  They are made criminals by NERA.I have always believed that one should be paid what one is worth and I believe the minimum wage should be looked at.  I cannot understand how someone can buy a cup of coffee for 70 cent in Portugal or Spain but it is €2.50 here.  Why?  The answer is regulation.  I spoke to a shop owner recently who told me that on a bank holiday, any staff working must get double time and the permanent staff who will not work that day get a paid day off.  Effectively, a nine hour day costs him 27 hours pay.I am very pro-business and we need to look at circumstances now.  It was a different story two years ago and we must get back to basics.  We must have room not only to create jobs, but to hold and consolidate those jobs that exist at the moment.  We must be more realistic.  I spoke to a public servant who said to me, in response to a question about the pension levy, that he had looked out at his neighbour who had spent €320,000 on a house a year ago and he thought to himself that at least he had a job to go to.We must stop putting so much regulation in front of employers; they are sick of it.  The finest restaurant in Killarney now closes on Sunday.  It would have served 300 plates on a Sunday but it is now closed.  Deputy Fleming made a good point about the restaurant owner with a disabled member of staff, who was doing the right thing by giving the individual some self-worth with the permission of the disabled person's parents.  I employed 22 people before I entered the Dáil and regularly the parent of a disabled person would ask me to give that person a few hours.  I told them I would but I would not be able to pay him or her the full whack.  Some of them did not even want payment; they just wanted to give their children an outlet, somewhere to be rather than stuck at home in front of the television all day, every day.  Some were better than others but it was the right thing to do and I did it regularly.There is no due process with NERA.  They come in the door and they will nail the business owner.  That is why I call them ninjas; they come in with the intention of nailing him or her.  It is like Revenue coming in to do an audit, telling a person things about himself or herself they had forgotten years ago.  The owner of the restaurant Deputy Fleming was in had to provide all this paperwork on the spot.  It has been stated that NERA does not need statutory footing but it could become too powerful and, in the current climate, we must be pro-active and pro-business.During the month of January alone, 1,000 people a day lost their jobs, many in high-tech industries and others in service industries.  Those people would be glad to go to work at a decent workplace for a decent wage because they are worried about their houses, their children's education, their bills and that they are now dependent on social welfare.  Those who were self-employed and are now out of work, having paid PAYE and PRSI for ten or 20 staff for ten years, will get nothing for 12 months.  We must be pro-business and pro-job and this is the wrong way to go about it.I have a 14 year old daughter and she said last night that she wanted to work for the summer.  I asked her what she wanted to do and she said she would work in her uncle's hotel four or five hours a day for four days a week because she wants to start saving for college.  Under this regulation, even if I give her permission and my brother employs her, it is not enough.  Under this regulation, he could be fined up to €250,000 for failure to keep adequate records, €5,000 for offences or receive a prison sentence of up to five years.This Bill gives NERA extraordinary new powers similar to those of the gardaí, the customs authorities and the Competition Authority.  The authority will be able to enter and inspect a work place, seal it off and remove documents from it.  It does not need any basis for doing so and does not need to be acting on a complaint.  This legislation is anti-business and anti-employment and should be reconsidered.

Those who contributed most to the crisis should be required to contribute most to its solution.  People should be asked to contribute according to their ability to pay.  I deplore the attempt to scapegoat public service workers and to create divisions between those who work in the public and private sectors.I attended meetings last week with Members from Counties Leitrim and Roscommon.  There was anger among workers who have given great service to the country and who feel let down and neglected by this Government.  I wish to read into the record one of more than 1,000 e-mails and letters which my office has received in the past three weeks conveying the anger of normally law-abiding people.  It states:I am a clerical officer in [a] motor tax office . . . I am contacting you in relation to the recent imposition of a pensions levy on my salary.  This levy will introduce a grossly unreasonable burden on my finances.At present my take home pay is approximately €440 a week far below the kind of wages the government refers to when discussing public service [salaries].  The financial position of the majority of public servants has been misrepresented to the general public who [believe] we all earn upwards of €30000 [a year].I have a mortgage, personal loans and substantial childcare costs.  My [partner's] employment is not secure given the economic conditions and even with both incomes increases in insurance, motor tax, salary levy to name but a few represent a major challenge to us.I [previously worked] for the private sector and had superior pay, health cover and pension plan.I chose to join the public sector for job security and financial security despite a net loss in salary of €4500 at the time.  I have been betrayed by the government and any party that endorses [inequitable] cuts in my take home pay. . .It is your duty to ensure that you do [your] upmost to protect the economy but not by [excessively] reducing the take home pay of public sector workers without [regard] for the contribution that everyone who remains employed through these difficult times could make.This levy must be reconsidered and [adjusted] to distribute the cost most fairly.I have met hundreds of public sector workers who believe there is a campaign by this Government to outline a position that they are protected and cosseted.  This message is wrong and, under bench marking two, they were deprived increases of up to 12.5% on the basis that the State was providing a pension for them and, as a consequence, they found themselves with less money, and they now face this inequitable measure.  Each one is put to the pin of his or her collar to manage family budgets.Our policy should not be one of a class war between the public and private sectors.  More than 160,000 people have been made unemployed in the past year and our thoughts are with them.  We need to come up with solutions, but tackling the public sector, which has been very loyal to this country, is not the way to do so.  We need a plan and a roadmap from this Government, which cannot be ham-fisted, to get us out of this problem.Fine Gael has long argued that the only way to restore confidence in the country is a root and branch reform of the way Government does its business.  We need to break up the cosy relationship between Fianna Fáil, the big banks, the developers, the regulators and senior public servants which has concealed waste and the failures of this Government and destroyed the fundamentals of our economy.I am very concerned that unless the Government acts fairly and reasonably, there could be blood on the streets.  This is a law-abiding nation, but I have never witnessed such anger.  The Government must climb down from its ivory tower and treat the people who work in this country with respect and dignity and ensure this situation is redressed.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	550	The Government's public sector pension levy is unfair, imbalanced and ill-conceived.  It is designed to hit low and middle income earners, a repetitive feature of the economic policies of the current Government.  Ireland is once again the sick man of Europe.  Our economy will shrink by at least 5% this year.  With an unprecedented 36,500 people signing on the dole in January, double the previous record, the Taoiseach has admitted that the live register will rise to at least 400,000 by Christmas, twice the level of when he took office.Low and middle level public servants, small businesses and PAYE workers are now bearing the brunt of the problems created by huge failures on the part of Government politicians, some bankers, some business leaders and regulators.The root of Ireland's unique difficulties is the cronyism of Fianna Fáil over the years.  The economic principles that delivered the prosperity of the Celtic tiger under Fine Gael in the 1990s — keeping costs down through competition, high productivity, export-led growth, tight budgeting and strong regulation of the financial sector and housing market — were all abandoned by corrupt Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1997.  Instead, the wealth generating power of the private sector and the public service mission of the State were bent by Fianna Fáil to serve the interests of a new golden circle of banks, property developers, big businesses, senior public servants and regulators.Instead of continuously harassing the Opposition for lack of co-operation with a scheme designed to penalise those least able to pay, the Taoiseach and his Government would have been better advised to seek the co-operation of Opposition parties for a revised levy designed to save €1 billion and aimed at those earning in excess of, say, €100,000 and then look to the main Opposition parties for ideas on how to save the other €1 billion without driving low paid workers on to the dole and out of their homes.  Irrespective of whether the Taoiseach wants to admit it, proposals by Fine Gael to make the necessary savings through such measures as a pay, increment and bonus freezes in the public sector and pay cuts for those earning €100,000 plus, the overhaul of FÁS operations, efficiency reviews and bureaucratic streamlining would be an effective means of achieving what the Government has lumped into inequitable penalties on those least able to cope or bear the brunt.In the past few months, the Taoiseach has perfected the art of talking the talk without saying anything.  His Government has wasted valuable time and money talking around the issue of recession without delivering solutions.  For the Taoiseach to expect low and middle earners to once again bear the brunt of cutbacks is unfair and untenable.  What does it take to make him realise that the loss of €450 to an already hard pressed worker on €15,000 is far more crippling than the €28,750 annual levy for those on a salary of €300,000 and more.  It is extremely puzzling to low paid workers that judges are exempt from the levy.  I hope the Taoiseach can give a reasonable explanation as to why that is the case.Fine Gael has consistently called for the reform of the public service, which is imperative and vital to the national interest.  Public service reform is not a criticism of the Civil Service.  Our public service has a fine tradition of dedication and makes a major contribution to the economic and social life of Ireland.  We must improve structures to make it more citizen-centred in the delivery of services and in the provision of essential infrastructure.  The public must be given an input into policy-making to ensure services are designed and delivered to meet the highest standards, greater knowledge of services and to ensure access to them with greater ease.  This would attract the confidence of our citizens in the system.It is also important to improve technologies to help in the delivery of services, to provide better value for money and greater efficiencies.  There is nothing wrong with radical reform and transformation of the Civil Service to bring a system, which we essentially inherited and utilised since the foundation of the State, up to 21st century standards.

A sense of fairness is important too, but the acknowledged difficulties in achieving a consensus on how that is to be reflected cannot be an alibi for inaction or delay or for arguing that the responsibility falls on other people, not ourselves.As the chief economist at the Commerzbank in Germany stated in the Financial Times of 14 February, “The lesson of the past six months is that every country has been affected — whether it had a bubble in the property market or not.”  The main story in today’s Le Figaro, headlined, The Collapse of the Japanese Economy, reports on an annualised drop in growth of 12.7% and a fall in industrial production of 21% between December 2008 and December 2009.  We are not uniquely to blame for our situation, but we bear responsibility, past and present.We have a great belief in our exceptionalism, but it is a pity all of us did not learn more from the Asian tiger economies when they became defunct.  Even though providentially overflowing revenue was put aside into the National Pensions Reserve Fund, some of which will be used to recapitalise the banks, and private savings were incentivised, former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, is often criticised for his remark, "When we have it, we spend it."  During those years, the Government was often urged by those opposite to spend still more of it.  If there were prophetic voices crying in the wilderness, they did not include any party that put before the electorate in 2007 ambitious plans to spend more and tax less.Nearly everyone was glad of the Celtic tiger.  Some gained only moderately, others a good deal, and a few gained spectacular runaway wealth.  Child benefit and pensions increased far beyond inflation.  We have the second highest minimum wage.  In no other country has 38% of the workforce been exempt from tax.  Unfortunately, we allowed a culture to develop where, higher up, people's value has too often been defined by their salaries and their bonuses.Public servants participated in the good times as well.  Salaries since 1997 have increased from 20% to 60% in real terms.  Numbers went up from 219,000 to 317,000.  The conviction that private sector wages were increasing even faster was responsible for the first benchmarking exercise.  Only Professor Ed Walsh is calling for benchmarking today, because all-round wage cuts would be the outcome.Earlier today, I was speaking to executives of an indigenous company, employing 80 people.  To preserve employment, and against union advice, the workforce agreed recently to a 5% cut in wages for anyone earning more than €25,000 a year, a 7.5% cut for those earning more than €60,000 a year, a 10% cut for those earning more than €80,000 a year and a 17% cut for the two top earners.  Last weekend, I spoke to the vice-president of a US multinational outside my constituency.  Leaving aside low-wage competition, he told me the average wage for their Irish workers was €58,000 a year, €45,000 a year for their US workers and about €34,000 a year for their English workers, with implications for their ability to maintain their workforce unless something is done to change costs.In the past, real wages could be adjusted downwards by inflation and devaluation and competitiveness could be restored.  Today, deflation may help preserve spending power, but that is all.  As members of the eurozone, our currency has appreciated and we are committed to tight budgeting disciplines to which we must return if we want to retain control over our destiny.  Currently, established public sector employees are guaranteed a high degree of job security.  If we do not face the fact that all our wage costs must be lowered, at least in weighted proportion according to ability to pay, we will exacerbate our situation.I accept that it is very difficult to ask trade unions, whose job it is to defend their members and to negotiate better conditions, to accept this.  It also asks much of the majority of us who spend what we have and run up debt.  However, the reality is that unless we are ruthless with ourselves and adapt quickly to the new situation without excessive arguing and fighting, we will endure a worse experience and stay on the floor longer.What of the really wealthy?  In 1932 at the time of the Great Depression, de Valera famously declared that no man was worth more than €1,000 a year.

I am surprised the urgency of the problem is not getting through to some people.  The bottom line is that revenues are falling at an inordinate rate and the economy is shrinking.  Two years ago we were talking about potential growth of 4%, but now we are talking about a potential contraction of the economy of between 4% and 6%.Whatever Government is in power will have to deal with this problem.  If we do not generate finance, the only options are to borrow it or cut spending, or try a combination of both.  This is what the Government is trying to do.  The challenge facing the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and their colleagues is significant.  They must save €2 billion or cut spending by that amount this year and save or cut a further €4 billion next year.  If we think our problems as public representatives are difficult this year, I fear for the situation next year.  Hopefully, we will see an improvement in the world economy and will, to an extent, benefit from that upturn.The sheer speed of the economic downturn has caught everybody, not just here but internationally, by surprise.  Ireland, as such an open economy, is doubly exposed to the downturn.  The shortfall in the public finances will put significant pressure on all Ministers with regard to their spending budgets.I agree with some previous speakers that this debate should not go down the road of public versus private sector workers.  This attitude is being generated in certain media quarters, but cultivation of it would be unfortunate because it divides workers and families.  The majority of individual workers are concerned and serious about trying to find a resolution to the problem.What we see in the financial and banking sector is a cause of concern for people.  The case is made that over the past 15 years banks have operated a cosy cartel for senior managers.  Much of what is coming out of late tends to suggest there were some very close relationships between individuals at a high level in banking and business in particular.One area I ask the Minister and the Government to examine seriously is that of families and individuals who have run into serious debt and are having problems with their mortgage repayments.  They paid at the top of the market to buy themselves a house and now they find themselves having problems with repayments.  I encourage the Minister and the Government to ensure that the banks look leniently on all those who find themselves in this unfortunate position.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	561	I welcome the opportunity to address this motion and in particular to support the amendment.  It is difficult for all of us to comprehend the scale of the problem in our public finances at present.  The gap of €18 billion is difficult to comprehend when one considers that we had surpluses recently.  We must recognise and accept that the cost of running the State for the coming year will be €55 billion while we will try to operate on the basis of revenues of €37 billion.  It will be an enormous task for the Government to try to bring about a resolution over a period of time.  It is coping with this as best it can in very difficult circumstances.It is clear that Ireland is not alone in this regard although there has been an exercise by some to suggest that a couple of builders, politicians and bankers caused this problem.  This is an international crisis.  As Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs I was in Brussels last week to attend a joint parliamentary meeting.  If we think we have problems, it is clear from speaking with parliamentarians from throughout Europe that they have similar situations and, in some cases, more severe difficulties than we have.  If it was our problem alone we could trade out of it but this is not the situation.  Our trading partners are severely restricted because of the state of their finances and this makes the problems for us far more difficult.We are where we are I suppose and as Bill Clinton stated, one must play the hand of cards one is dealt rather than the hand one would like.  The Government has to take action and is doing so to address this crisis.  It has put in place a plan to chart a route back to a balanced budget.  The reason it has to do this is a requirement to balance the books.  We are part of the Growth and Stability Pact in Europe and it is a requirement to get back into line with the recommendations of this.  We have sought and received an accommodation that will allow us to do this over a period of time.  We cannot borrow to the extent that some on the Opposition benches want.  We cannot do so because it would affect our capacity to borrow and pay back in the future.  The greater the borrowing we do now, the greater the burden we put on future generations.  Those who saw how we traded out of it in the past would not want to see it again.The decision to place the levy will burden all public sector workers.  Among the people I have met there is as much annoyance among those on €60,000 as there is among those on €25,000.  Anybody who has an income in any of these brackets has developed a lifestyle which requires this money to be spent.  The money is not there to meet their demands.  It is unfortunate but this is the situation.  Nobody in either the public or private sector can afford a reduction in income but unfortunately it must happen in this case.We must implement cost savings and I suppose over time we will see an increase in taxation to try to bring about equilibrium between what it costs to run the State and what we raise.  The levy is just the beginning in many cases and the Government has indicated that over the next four to five years significant steps will have to be taken to bring back the notion of a balanced budget.The public servants I have met are prepared to play their part but they want equality.  They believe it is vital that equality is the bedrock of the system.  They want to see those who have damaged the reputation of our banking system brought to book and I am confident that this will happen.  I am delighted that the Taoiseach today outlined his vision and his views on this.While the Opposition is attempting to fool or mislead the public——

The rest of the world faces the same problems we do but we are taking a bigger hit than many other countries because of our trading situation, especially with regard to trading with our neighbours across the Irish Sea.  Up to 20% of our exports go to the sterling area and the 33% devaluation of sterling has had a serious effect on this country's income.At home, we have had a downward spiral in purchases in the retail trade and in all other businesses.  On top of this, with regard to house building, people could buy houses at equivalent prices to 1994 or 1995 due to interest rates and the drop in prices but it is not happening.

VAT, income tax, corporation tax and stamp duty intakes are shrinking.  In the long term this means that the funds available to the Government to pay wages and to pay for all services are reducing.Those who watched the news at 6 p.m. saw that the debt ratio is due to climb to 65% in the next year or two.  This is not acceptable in that it will mean we will pay up to one third of our income tax to pay the interest on our debt.  We will be heading back to the situation we had in the 1980s when all our PAYE intake went to pay the interest on our debt.  We do not want to face back into this situation.  The Government must take serious decisions to ensure our economy is brought back into a stable position and we do not throw away the gains we made over the past 20 years.As the Minister stated, the Government will borrow €4,500 for every man, woman and child in the State.  More than one quarter of our current bills, including pay, will be paid with borrowed money and the money we need to borrow will use up one third of income tax receipts.  This is why the Government made the decisions it did over the past year.  In the coming years, more unpalatable decisions must be made if we want to bring our economy back into equilibrium.  Nobody likes to make those types of decisions but they must be made.  I am confident the decisions that will be made will ensure each and every citizen will be treated equitably and that the burden will not fall disproportionately on those on lower incomes, who should not be made pay more than their fair share.

I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on the Private Members' motion and to support the Fianna Fáil amendment.With regard to the pension levy, this is certainly no easy time for any family.  My colleague has depicted the global scene, including the European scene, and it is evident from this that our difficulties are no different from those of any other country.  Deputy Michael Ahern referred to exports to the United Kingdom and the depreciation of sterling, which has made trade very awkward in this country.We have been very lucky that the number of public sector employees increased significantly in recent years.  We all welcomed this but with it comes the burden of additional pay.  While there is to be expenditure of €54 billion this year, more than one third, approximately €20 billion, will be on public sector pay.  Anybody with a commonsense approach will know this is not sustainable.  It is for this reason, and also because nobody has any alternative, that the levy was introduced.The pension levy does two things: it protects existing public service jobs and it protects pensions.  Despite what we heard tonight and last night, nobody on the opposite side of the House has come up with any worthwhile proposal that will meet the shortfall of €2 billion.  We can cry and scream all we like and criticise this and that, but one should not be allowed to have one's say unless one can step up to the plate.  The parties opposite have not done so and this must be emphasised.I congratulate the Minister for Finance on the code of conduct introduced for the banking sector.  For the first time, very strong protection measures are being introduced in respect of the making of mortgage repayments and banks trying to repossess houses.  This offers comfort to many mortgage holders.  Given time, confidence will grow among first-time buyers, many of whom are waiting for prices to fall further.  I am sure they will fall.Despite all the negativity, we must recognise how much the cost of running a car, for example, has decreased in recent years.  Insurance costs have decreased considerably, as have the costs of petrol and tax.  Home heating oil prices have decreased considerably also.  There are major savings to be made.  If one listened to all the doom and gloom, one would conclude there are no savings to be made, but there are.  When times are difficult, there are positive developments.  I find it hard to read a motion that criticises every measure but fails in every way to state how the required €2 billion could be saved.There has been much talk about the ten individuals in Anglo Irish Bank.  Considerable pressure was placed on the Taoiseach all day to name them.  I hope the Taoiseach and this House do not to find out who the individuals are.  If the recklessness in this House over recent weeks is repeated when the names are discovered, the individuals will not be prosecuted.I listened last week to the leader of Fine Gael talking about banks going bust and to the Labour Party finance spokesperson talking about a particular bank going bust.  They do not seem to know how reckless their statements are.  They are causing markets to fall further.

Our public service performs a crucially important role in this State and it will play a very important part in ensuring that Ireland comes through this global economic crisis.Over the past few weeks, I have received many representations from the public sector in my constituency of Dublin North.  The vast majority of these people have said very clearly to me that they are willing to make a contribution towards resolving the current economic difficulty.  They also want to make sure that their contribution is fair and that other sectors within the country pay their fair share also.  This was of no surprise to me because, in my day-to-day dealings with public sector staff, I have found them to be professional and courteous.  At all times, they act in the interest of the State.The decision to introduce the pensions levy was not taken easily but in the clear knowledge that it would not be popular initially or be supported by the public sector.  The Minister himself said today that we know the levy will impose a burden on public servants and their families.  Many of my constituents in Dublin North are public servants but I must act responsibly as a Deputy in this Dáil to support what will best protect the future of all citizens of the State.The Government endeavoured to reach an agreement with the social partners, including the unions.

It spent over a month doing so.  I did not have an opportunity to interrupt the Deputy yet.As part of the framework agreed in the discussions, the social partners and the Government were at one in agreeing that €2 billion in additional savings were required this year.  That is a fact.What is required to deal with the €18 billion hole in our public finances is urgent and decisive action. We could wait no longer to bring about these changes for the good of the country and to ensure that these measures form a part of stabilising our public finances.

Is the Labour Party being fair in its evaluation of the pensions levy?  It has even stated it would introduce one but it has not produced any figures on what its proposal would save.  Urgent action is needed and the Labour Party appeared to agree with this approach just a month ago.The Government is committed to remaining engaged with the social partners over the coming years to bring about the required savings of €18 billion.  The scaled pensions levy is the fairest way to try to deal with the public sector pay bill, which cannot be sustained at present.  The levy is scaled based on earnings, from 3% for those on €15,000, to 9.6% for those on €300,000 and over.  The levy attracts full tax relief at the marginal rate and will also have the effect of securing the defined benefit pensions held by the public service.  A pay cut would have done neither.  It is not a question of singling out the public service.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	621	For example, the cleaning staff in one section of Leinster House will have to pay the levy on their miserable income while similar staff in another part of this House are not covered by the levy.  One group is in the private sector and the other group is in the public sector, both are badly paid, but the levy only applies to one group.  The proposal seeks to divide workers and set them against one another.The other example of unfairness is the different rates payable within the targeted group.  For example, a public service worker on €39,000 a year will pay €2,120 while his or her colleague on €44,000 will pay only €1,858.  How can that be justified?  It cannot.  It is unfair and unacceptable.  The strongest case against the levy is the application to those who cannot afford to pay.  The levy applies to part-time workers, sole earners in families that are in receipt of family income supplement — a payment made to people who are on the breadline — and it is payable by workers who are on such low wages that they are not liable for income tax.  It is payable on overtime and other income that cannot be reckoned in calculating pensions.  How can any of that be justified?  How is any of that fair or equitable?  How is that sharing the burden equally?Since the Government gate-crashed this wage cut through the talks with the social partners, I, like others, have been contacted by large numbers of public service workers.  Every man and woman to whom I have spoken or from whom I have received e-mails are all prepared and willing to pay their fair share to rescue the economy.  They stress they are not the cause of the problem.  They are insistent that whatever is done must be worked out on a fair and equitable basis across all of society and not on a sectional basis, as is the case with the levy.  I support them in that.  They are angry that they and the public service they provide have been vilified as lazy and overpaid by their Government and the media.

His rhetoric may well have been Churchillian but his actions to date are more like Colonel Blimp.  The totality of the Minister's plan for national recovery is unfair, unthought-out and will divide the nation at a time when common effort is required to solve the genuinely enormous problems we face.To begin with, we must recognise why we are in this mess.  That is the question citizens throughout the country want to hear answered first.  Since 2001 a speculator's economy was deliberately created to encourage greed, cheered on by Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Governments, who wanted light-handed regulation and control and who regarded timely warnings from these benches as pinko socialism to be scorned and laughed at and who exhorted the nation to party on.  Some did party on — and some continue to party — not, however, the vast bulk of our public servants who got mortgages for houses at inflated prices and to build homes, who paid their taxes and lived ordinary lives, not extravagant ones.The country is in a grave and serious place.  We, on this side of the House know that full well.  The people want those who are responsible for bringing us here to at least acknowledge their role in the disaster.  World economic events have made matters worse but our basic vulnerability was home grown.  First, there must be an accounting, politically and within the banking and speculative classes.  Only then, can one ask the nation with any legitimacy to put our collective shoulder to the wheel.  Second, there must be a plan, one that maps a route to a stable economy that involves all in society and that is fair in terms of its scope and ability to pay.Last night the Minister for Finance said that the Government plan was to baldly introduce cutbacks amounting to €2 billion.  That is no plan.  Even today the Minister admitted on Question Time that he would be lucky to get €800 million but the nice, balancing economics means that it can be accounted for as €2 billion.  There is no confidence in the so-called plan.  Basic taxation decisions that need to be made now are being long-fingered to the Commission on Taxation, the report from which will be implemented some time next year.  Things have changed utterly in this economy and in this nation.  Everything has to be thought through again, including our governance, our delivery systems for public services, our support systems and oversight of business, how our professions operate for the public good and much more.This imbalanced levy, targeted at one section of society, will do nothing to solve our problems.  The country deserves better than that.  We need to reconstruct the proposal in the context of a truly comprehensive plan and bring the whole country together in the common vital objective of restoring our national finances.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	632	We were told over and over again that when the economic downturn came there would be a soft landing.  Now we are being told that we are all in it together.  Neither statement is true.  It was a crash landing with debris scattered all over the place and nobody who has the responsibility for managing it is ready to step up to the plate and take on that responsibility.  There is nobody to tidy up the mess.  We are not all in it together, because if we were, the pain would be shared evenly among those who could best carry it and it would not be off-loaded selectively on to the lowest earners.  Low paid public servants have been selected for special treatment.  There is no sign of bankers handing back their golden handshakes and taking a significant drop in their millions in salaries or bonuses or of developers being called to heel to pay their share.  Instead, modestly paid jobs in the private sectors are being shed and the lowest paid public servants are carrying a disproportionate share of the burden in the form of  pension levy or, as it should be more properly called, a pay cut.Over the past while, the Government and sections of the media have orchestrated an insidious campaign to demonise the public sector.  Government backbenchers and Ministers together with business leaders and media commentators tripped over themselves to talk about plump public sector hens with Rolls Royce pensions, which is nonsense.  They are living in a parallel universe if they think the levy on the table is fair to the lowest paid.  Will they explain to my constituent who has worked out a budget arising from the so-called pension levy where she will find the missing €300 per month for her food, mortgage or heating bills?  Will they tell the ambulance workers who wear stab proof vests as they go to work that they are overpaid?  Community welfare officers are working overtime for free as they attempt to clear the backlog of cases.  Will they be told they are lazy and do no work?  What about telling the community garda who has no prospect of promotion for years or the teacher with a class of 30 or more students that they will have a Rolls Royce pension?  The only people who will have Rolls Royce pensions are the bankers, builders and business people who creamed it during the boom.Like every other Member, I have received hundreds of e-mails, telephone calls and representations at my constituency clinics from worried, desperate and angry people.  Three issues have arisen during all these contacts, the first of which is equality.  Despite the Government's bleating, the levy is unequal.  A graph highlights that those on low and middle incomes are taxed disproportionately.  A person earning €120,000 annually, for example, only pays 3% more than someone earning €30,000 a year.  How is this equitable?  As the levy stands, people who will not receive a pension will still be levied while judges, for example, will be exempt.The second issue is justice.  Most of the e-mails I received echo the following sentiment: "I am willing to pay my fair share but when I've seen the fat cats get away with driving the Irish economy into a black hole, then why should I pay?"  Despite having done serious and possible irreparable damage to the banking system, no one has been held to account.  The Government guaranteed the Irish banking system in September and those in charged have only resigned in dribs and drabs instead of what one would expect, which is mass resignations.  A Government with a true understanding of the depth of public anger would surely have insisted on this. Where is the justice in a regulator who benignly oversaw what one commentator called "fraud" receiving a pay-off of almost €600,000?  These high earners are detached from the society in which the rest of us live.  One banker was happy to tell the  Government to tax child benefit while he was concealing loans while another attempted to elicit sympathy for the fact that his earnings would be under €2 million this year.The third issue is poverty.  The levy reduces wages at the lowest level to such an extent that it may act as a disincentive to work and lead people into a welfare trap.  As one constituent put it, "Financially I would be better off on the live register where I would qualify for health and income supplements".  Since it has been established that every extra person on the live register costs the State approximately €20,000 per annum, why would the Government further disincentivise work?"  We need as many people as possible contributing to the economy and the way the levy is structured will force workers on to the live register.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	633	I refer to how this decision was arrived at by the Taoiseach and the Government and what this indicates about their attitude to democracy, the people we represent and our political system.  A week prior to the announcement of the levy, the Taoiseach told the Opposition in this House that it was his way or the highway.  The levy details were presented to the unions at the 11th hour and they were told to "take it or leave it".  Until then, we had months of divide and rule during which public sector workers were demonised and dehumanised.  The Government's allies such as IBEC and right wing economists and media commentators bashed public servants because they have a vested interest.  IBEC made the most ridiculous suggestion by saying the solution to our economic problems was to put more people on the dole.It is telling that the Taoiseach's first significant speech was to Dublin businessmen and not to the people.  We have had an absentee Taoiseach for the past few months and we have had government by press conference and tips offs to journalists.  The Oireachtas has not had a genuine opportunity to contribute to the debate on the decision and there is no belief in or solidarity with the Government.  No pain was experienced by the Government or the Taoiseach, in particular, when thrashing out this proposal to make sure it was fair by dealing with anomalies, solving problems, involving all stakeholders, achieving consensus, persuading people and bringing them on board.  That was not part of the Government's plan.  The entire process is an indictment of Fianna Fáil and the Government's attitude to democracy, the political system and the people we represent.I received a copy of the Public Sector Times earlier.  The Taoiseach stated in an article, with the decision having been made, that it was only fair.  We voted on the fair deal legislation earlier.  The Government has taken the attitude that if it says something is fair, it is fair when obviously it is the opposite.  It is not news that the Government parties do not believe in fairness.  Tax cuts favoured the most well off in our society and they promoted land speculation.  The cutbacks in recent budgets hit those who could least afford them such as people with disabilities, those living in disadvantaged areas and pensioners.The Minister for Finance was quoted in today's newspapers regarding the anomalies associated with the levy and he admitted that low paid public servants would be hit hardest but his attitude was that is just the way it is.  Nothing will be done with the money taken from these workers.  There is no plan in that regard with vague promises having been made.I was a clerical officer in the VEC and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It was reported earlier that two thirds of public sector workers earn less than €50,000 annually.  Many of them are not well paid and they work hard dealing with the public.  I received an e-mail from a clerical officer in a social welfare office.  He referred to the sea of worried faces he must deal with every day.  Unfortunately, he cannot help many of them but he is now doing the job of two people because of the significant increase in queues at his office.The Government had months to negotiate the levy and to plan, persuade and achieve a consensus because tax reform and a recovery plan were needed.  The ICTU came up with a recovery plan but the Government could not do so.  Work schemes could have been put in place and we could have done what the US, Germany and other states are doing by investing in badly needed infrastructure while regenerating the economy.  People were prepared to play their part.  For example, those interviewed for a Newstalk vox pop on the day the levy was announced said they knew they would have to suffer some pain and they were prepared to take it as long as the levy was fair.  That goodwill was squandered by the Government parties because they have lost touch with the people and they are no longer democratic.  They have damaged the political system, social partnership and, at the end of the day, they have damaged themselves.  They will rue the day they did this.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	634	The decision by the Fianna Fáil, Green Party and Progressive Democrats Government to impose a pension levy on all public sector workers and only on public sector workers is wrong and fundamentally unjust.  It should be rescinded and the Government should go back to the drawing board.  The public sector constitutes less than a quarter of the workforce.  In the first instance, the equitable approach would be to spread the pain equally and not target one sector.  Second, the levy is unfair because it is payable on all earnings, including overtime and allowances, and not just on basic salary.  Third, low paid public sector workers who receive tax relief at 20% will pay a disproportionate contribution compared to higher paid workers who will receive tax relief at 41%.Fourth, there is a false belief abroad, fuelled in particular by sections of the media, that the public sector makes no contribution to its pension fund.  All public sector workers are already paying a compulsory contribution and most are paying 6.5% of their salary, which, in the case of health care workers, meets the full cost of their pensions without any State contribution.  This new levy will double that contribution for the vast majority of public sector workers and they will get nothing in return.  Fifth, and what is probably most infuriating for public sector workers, is that they were in no way responsible for the economic mess and recession we are in at present, yet they are the only ones singled out to pay the price.The legislation was published today and it is even worse than expected.  Public sector workers will be required to pay 3% on the entire first €15,000 earned.  Those are the people on the minimum wage and those who qualify for family income supplement.  They will be required to pay 6% on the next €5,000 and 10% on all earnings over €20,000, regardless of whether they earn €20,000, €25,000, €100,000 or €1 million.  That is an outrageously unfair tax.  The lowest paid are the hardest hit.Government mismanagement of the economy and bankers' greed and fraud are the real culprits.  Anglo Irish Bank appears to have been rotten to the core and contaminated Irish Life & Permanent and Irish Nationwide Building Society, yet there is no sign of the fraud squad or the Criminal Assets Bureau being called in to investigate.  The Government voted down the Labour Party's proposal that the Director of Corporate Enforcement would ask the High Court to appoint an officer with extensive powers to investigate the banks.Where is the Green Party?  While Green Party Members are making angry noises in the media, they have not yet taken a stand against any of the Government's unfair and unjust policies or on this issue.  In fact, a Green Deputy or Minister in this Chamber is now a rare sighting.  People will soon be sending letters to The Irish Times about it.  We will not say what bird we are talking about.

It is galling to hear the Bank of Ireland chief executive state nonchalantly on the airwaves that he expects to earn less than €2 million this year while his bank's shares and the pensions of so many people who invested their money, including redundancy money, are going through the floor and are virtually worthless.  It is also galling to see the Financial Regulator, who was asleep on his watch, ride off into the sunset with €600,000 of a golden handshake and a six-figure annual pension.The pain must be spread evenly, but it must be spread from the top down and not from the bottom up as is happening here.  Too often when it is spread from the bottom up it stops along the way and never reaches the higher echelons.  It is time to start with those who pay no tax and, first, is our well heeled tax exiles, who are always able to make it back home for the Galway Races and a table in the tent.  It is time to make them pay their taxes in Ireland.  Next come our resident landlords, the tens of thousands who have never registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board and evade and avoid paying taxes on their property and tenants.

They should cough up a few euro as well.These untapped sources should be targeted first before the Government moves to target either public or private sector workers.  This is also good economics because the more disposable income available to working men and women and their families, the more will be spent in the economy and therefore the more support for the retail sector and small and medium-sized businesses.  That is why the Labour Party is calling in this Private Members' motion on the Government to go back to the drawing board and find an equitable solution.  An equitable solution is the only solution and it is right for the public sector workforce to demand it.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	640	We are debating a defining motion.  It defines the fundamental principles that are necessary to underpin a national plan of recovery.  None of us in this House underestimate the gravity of the economic crisis we face.  The banking scandal, the international economic downturn and the level of Government incompetence shown so far all combine to collapse public confidence.  Unemployment is hammering families and communities across Ireland.  By year end there will be more people unemployed than are employed in the entire public service.  In our constituencies we are seeing the individual heartbreak of job losses and the fear of crippling debt.  For the first time I have had to bring in a box of Kleenex tissues and leave it on the desk in my constituency office because so many tears are now shed when constituents come into me.These are extraordinary times and they require extraordinary responses.  So far the Government has failed to present the roadmap that is needed to get us through.  The so-called pensions levy has been cack-handed in its construction.  By its narrow focus it has fuelled a false divide between public and private sector workers.  Yet, as our leader said last night, the real divide is between those who caused the crisis and those who are now paying the price.Labour has set out in this motion our belief that social partnership offers the best way forward.  The Government seems to want social partnership when times are good but thinks it can do without it when things are bad, which is folly.  When there is an onus to pull together as a society and confront the challenge, we must rely on the great strength of partnership and solidarity.  In this economic crisis people know that sacrifices are required of them but they also know that what is being imposed by the Government is unjust and the sense of anger and betrayal is palpable.  Ability to pay should be the yardstick when sacrifice is required.  Clearly, that is not the case now.  Those on highest incomes are escaping scot-free while those at the lowest incomes are made subject to Government extortion.There is a better way to get out of the mess.  Recently, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions set out ten key initiatives which could frame a national recovery plan.  They include taxation measures and innovative measures like a national recovery bond.  These could be central to good governance and prudent public financing.  I welcome too the document's emphasis on an immediate reduction in energy prices.  Today, I raised this issue with the Taoiseach and I was disappointed that I received the same vacuous response that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources gave last week.There is an urgency about meeting the challenge, an urgency that the Government has misunderstood.  Trampling on public sector workers is one approach but one more likely to succeed is an agreed national recovery plan based on the principles of solidarity and fairness.  That is an important point to remember because we are all very touched by the cases of the individuals who have contacted all Members of this House.  However, ultimately, it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that there is a roadmap pointing out the way forward and that people can support it in conscience.  That is completely at variance with what the Government is doing now, which is to railroad through measures which are a blunt instrument at least and totally unjust and unfair at worst.  If the Government intends to continue on that road we will see deeper division, more conflict and more unnecessary pain and heartbreak, which could and must be avoided.  The strength we have with social partnership is being ignored by a Government that does not seem to know its way forward and refuses to look to anybody else for assistance in addressing the major challenge facing us all today.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I am pleased to address the motion this evening.  Taking up from where Deputy McManus left off, we are all aware of the major challenges we face.  We have all had constituents in our clinics.  We are all aware of the anecdotes shared by speakers on all sides.  The situation set out by the Minister for Finance last night is really alarming.  He enumerated some of the figures that illustrate how deep the crisis is and I was particularly shocked to learn that one third of our income tax will be spent on interest payments on our borrowings.  We all know that there is pain and that it is regretted.  I want to set out why I believe our proposals on the pensions levy and other fiscal adjustment measures are the right way to go.  There are many reasons for this current situation and sometimes a blind eye is turned to those factors.  I refer in particular to the collapse of the international banking system, the collapse of global growth, the collapse of our own property sector, the construction boom coming to an end, unemployment and the currency situation between us and our nearest neighbour.  Ireland is more vulnerable under all those headings than any of our eurozone colleagues and this point has not been stressed enough in this Private Members' debate.  Ireland's international financial services sector is more prone, and as a strong exporting nation we are more open to the collapse in global growth.  The UK is one of our strongest trading partners and we were therefore more open to currency fluctuations.Many of the crystal ball gazers and the hindsight experts suggest that we should have seen all of this coming.  We all know that every policy has downside risks which we try to minimise and identify.  However, no one could have predicted that all of these risks would materialise at exactly the same time and that they would be mutually reinforcing.  However, many people in this Chamber claim that they saw it coming and that they were derided and were the subject of many snide remarks.  This was not the case.

Naturally the Government was criticised and naturally the Government defended itself but nobody foresaw those risks would happen at the same time.  It would be wrong of anybody to make that claim as it would be dishonest.The Government took action by announcing the smart economy initiative and the innovation fund before Christmas and there has been a €2 billion fiscal adjustment which is the subject of this debate.  There has been a capital investment plan which is predicated on job creation.  Unlike what has been said on the Labour benches, we have a plan that is greater than most of our European colleagues in terms of capital investment, constituting 5% of GDP.  We are reforming banking.  Nobody could have seen the damage that was done to the banks by the behaviour of some of our executives but many have now resigned or retired and that process will continue.  We need a complete clean-out of some of the top people in the banking sector.  The Government has shown courage and resolve in this crisis in tackling these issues.We have a progressive tax system but this fact is denied by people in the Labour Party who say there is not fairness in the tax system.  However, the top 9% of income earners pay almost half of all income tax.  This is not acknowledged by the Labour Party which turns a blind eye to the international situation.  At the very first hint of criticism, the Labour Party panicked and produced a document last Saturday which, as the Minister for Finance said yesterday, is back of the envelope stuff.  This shows that whatever difficulties they have ——

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	672	——we would not be in this House at all.I refer to a recent article in a Sunday newspaper in which the Minister of State's former leader said that when he left in May 2008 he left the economy in very good condition.  If we were to believe Deputy Bertie Ahern it is true to say that in a very short time consisting of six months the current Taoiseach and his Ministers, including the Minister of State, have destroyed the economy.  However, I am sure no one believes the statement Deputy Ahern made at that time either.The Labour Party motion describes this proposed pension levy as unfair as it places an unacceptable burden on public servants with modest incomes.  It has been argued that public servants are in permanent employment with a good pension.  I wonder what the 120 people employed by Kildare County Council, who were let go in the past few weeks, think of that suggesting?  What was the permanency attached to those jobs?  What was permanency attached to the 1,000 let go by local authorities right around the country in the past few weeks?  Where were the pensions and the permanency for those unfortunate people?This proposed pension levy is now regarded by everyone as a wage cut and it will put families under tremendous pressure as it will create further problems for them.  People have contacted me to outline their individual cases and their grave concerns for their income and future.  They talk about their children and the effect on them.  In many instances this wage cut will ensure that their child will not go to college because the Minister for Education and Science has outlined time and again that free third-level education will be a thing of the past come April or May this year when he gets his opportunity to talk to An Bord Snip.Last night the Minister in a flippant manner gave one of the worst speeches ever in this House.  He stated:I can assure Deputies that the Government did not take the decision to introduce this measure lightly.  We know it calls for a measure of sacrifice but it is called for so as to avoid a worse fate.He further stated that the pension-related deduction was not seeking to scapegoat the public service.  Was there ever a worse statement made in this House?  It will scapegoat the public service.  Since I became involved in politics in 1992, I have seen the work carried out by public servants on behalf of this State.  Now the Minister says we are not going to scapegoat them when in fact he is undermining each and every one of them.  He is not only undermining public servants but also their families and their children in the future.  This is the reason we have so many angry people outside the gates today.  This is the reason so many angry people were knocking on the Minister of State's door too because they see no future in this Government for their children and for the education of their children which is their right.We have one opportunity to get this right.  This Government has fobbed off that opportunity.  It has not thought it out.  It has tried to undermine ICTU and its members.  Out of the side of its mouth the Government suggested that ICTU told it that if it introduced the levy, congress would walk away and it would be all right on the day.  It was a scandalous and scurrilous remark intended to undermine ICTU.  Our one hope is that the Government will return to the table to ensure that a proper and right agreement can be reached with the social partners to benefit the State in the first instance and, in the second instance, to be fair across communities.

I will address a single dimension, namely, citizenship.  Not today or yesterday, a continuous, sinister and despicable campaign started that devalued public service.  During the so-called boom times, public servants were regularly contrasted with the buccaneer individualists who were supposedly making a fortune bringing the economy unto the glory days, but who actually wrecked it.In the minute or two available to me, let us deal with some facts.  It costs €55 million per day to run the country.  While the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, was right that one third of income tax will go to pay the interest, let him continue the story.  We are paying interest of 5.5% on our borrowings, 3.5% more than we were a couple of weeks ago because a few people in the banking sector wrecked the country's international reputation.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	675	Last week and on Monday, when members from different unions from around the country visited their Deputies, they did something that was difficult.  They spoke about their jobs and their children and what it cost them to live, not just to participate.  The bankers who knifed the country's reputation went into hiding.  Their names are still being protected.  They comprise the golden missing circle that wrecked the country.Does the Government prepare a five-year response to our economic position?  Does it tell the House that the €16.5 billion will be removed within a structured way?  No.  Instead, it starts with the people it has caught while releasing a shower of deceit.  Some 300,000 public servants did not receive increases in the second benchmarking exercise in 2008 because they had an imputed benefit of 12.5% in terms of pensions.  On top of that there is the 6.5% pension contribution, the 1% income levy and now this levy.  These are the facts and let us not run away from them.What did people ask us at the meetings?  If this levy is imposed when the Government looks for €2 billion, what will occur when it seeks €4 billion?  People have been unfairly and unequally hammered.  Their children will not be able to attend third level education.  When all of the windy statements from the pseudo-sham republicans are made, how will they possibly justify a family with three children and an entitlement to €1,100 in family income supplement paying €2,700 in a levy?  It is nonsense.  It would be fine were if it were only absurd, but it is unfair, unequal and destructive of citizenship.I support solidarity and Mr. David Begg.  The Labour Party motion supports ICTU and refers to solidarity in a real sense.  We could be positive and build a new economy, but all of the people across the floor are around the corpse of the old speculative economy.  They are asking whether we can revert to how we were.  The people who attended meetings in County Galway and across the country were not on waiting lists for helicopters and were not those who delivered us into a situation in which we have more Mercedes cars per capita than Germany.  They were interested in paying their mortgages, getting an education for their children and retaining basic good health.  They were public servants, people who chose to work for the public rather than themselves.  They have been denigrated, insulted and treated unfairly, chosen as the first victims by a Government that will not show the House its five-year strategy to address the €16.5 billion deficit.There are many examples, but I will finish with the landlords who own multiple houses.  They must pay €200 per house, but their benefits in tax breaks will amount to €550 million.  Would that not have been a good place to start?  Would it not have been practical?  What of the people in hiding from the banks who can fork as much as they like into their pension funds with tax benefits?  If the Government could have found them, it could have started there.  What citizenship is it to take one's passport with the Irish stamp on it and refuse to pay one's tax?

The latter was put on the table at the 11th hour of the negotiations, on which the Taoiseach deemed sufficiently important to spend weeks while the country waited with baited breath for a resolution to the various crises besetting us.  We want the proposal withdrawn in a way that reflects the fact that many of us cling to the notion that we are one society on one island.

We resent Fianna Fáil's attempt to drive a wedge between people who work in the public service and those in the private sector.  I do not have to tell the House that many teachers, nurses, gardaí and other public servants are married to carpenters, bricklayers and shop and factory workers.  It is not like South Africa under apartheid, two separate corrals of people who never meet one another.  We reject Fianna Fáil's vision of a divided Ireland where public and private sector workers will fight it out.Tomorrow, I will discuss the levy's unfairness in detail.  Most of the public sector workers who I know are realists and know that sacrifices must be made.  What contribution will the Government demand of the bankers who have brought the country to the point of economic ruin?  What of the tax exiles who leave this country in their helicopters at five minutes to midnight to secure another tax-free day in this jurisdiction?  What will the Minister of State demand from them?  Does the Irish passport carry a commitment to paying tax and contributing to this country?

When they are young and children or when they are old, on a pension or in a nursing home, then society returns to them what they contributed when they were able bodied and worked and studied.  This is our vision and is what a social solidarity pact is about.  I can only repeat my suggestion to the Minister of State regarding those two little words, "withdraw" and "redraw".  The Government should withdraw the legislation and then redraw these proposals.  Let us build a social solidarity pact for Ireland in order that people can go forward in the knowledge that the banker who only earns €2 million per year at least contributes proportionately.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	684	With the indulgence of the Ceann Comhairle I would like to share time with Deputy Shortall.  Last Thursday morning the 1,135 workers at SR Technics were given the devastating news of the closure of the company's operation at Dublin Airport.  Mr. Bernd Kessler, the chief executive of SR Technics, blamed the loss of major customers at the Dublin Airport facility, the downturn in the aviation business due to the recession and the so-called high cost base of the operation.  Mr. Kessler said that the closure came after an in-depth review of all lines of business across the SR group.The news is a shocking body blow to Swords and the whole north side of Dublin, west Dublin and much of east Leinster, including Meath and Kildare.  For the 1,135 workers and their families the loss of their livelihoods is a cruel blow at the worst of economic times.  Many of the families concerned had several family members involved and much of the workforce had vast aviation engineering experience going back to their days in Aer Lingus, Team Aer Lingus and FLS.  For all of them, an SR Technics closure would be a dreadful tragedy.  When I repeatedly tried to raise the matter last Thursday before being asked to leave the House by the Ceann Comhairle, I noted the major negative impact of the decision on thousands of other workers in the SR supply chain and on their families.The first major question which arises since Thursday is why nothing was done to prevent this disaster by Bernd Kessler of SR Technics of Zurich and the majority Middle Eastern owners, Mubadala Development, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise and Istithmar.  When distinguished journalists were asking questions about the future of SR Technics six months ago, why was there no information or consultation with workers by Mr. Kessler and his colleagues?  Over recent months, why were there not intensive discussions with the workforce and indeed all airport stakeholders to find a way forward?A second, even more important question, arises.  Last Friday and Saturday, I met many members of the SR workforce in my constituency.  The overwhelming impression they gave me is that SR Technics should not be closing and that every effort should be made to rescue the company as a going concern.  The workers detailed their excellent engineering and economic performance from Team Aer Lingus through the FLS period up to the present.  Their renowned expertise in aircraft overhaul, the landing gear division, the auxiliary powers unit, line maintenance and the aircraft garage was recognised throughout the world.  Critically, they believe that costs in Dublin were always sustainable but that their Zurich headquarters inflated charges to present the Dublin operation as unviable.The last SR Technics Holdings annual report seems strongly to support the workers' case.  The loss of the Aer Lingus contracts was a direct result of privatisation, which the Labour Party fiercely opposed, but it is also striking that there are ongoing problems with the Aer Lingus French contracts and that Gulf Air tried unsuccessfully to persuade SR Technics to keep the Gulf Air contract in Dublin.  It is also alleged that many other airline contracts were deliberately diverted from Dublin.  There is a profound suspicion that SR Technics Dublin is being closed to take capacity out of the air maintenance market and to destroy competition for the Zurich and Middle East facilities of SR Technics and its owners.As I have told the Taoiseach over the past three days in the Dáil, his performance and that of the Tánaiste, IDA Ireland and the other State agencies involved has been appalling in the SR Technics matter.  Nothing seems to have been done over many months to protect the 1,200 jobs.  Once more we had a last minute meeting between the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, and an endangered company, which achieved nothing as usual.A closure cannot be countenanced by the Irish State and aviation interests.  If a sale, a management buy-out or a management worker partnership can be developed to run SR Technics as a going concern, what assistance can the Minister, Dublin Airport stakeholders and job creation agencies offer to any rescue plan?We are putting €7 billion into insolvent banks but letting jobs in other sectors, including the critical aviation sector, evaporate.  Let us start the jobs fightback by retaining the 1,200 jobs in aviation maintenance at Dublin Airport.

I am very disappointed that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, chose to leave the Chamber.  She was in the Chamber for the vote but she chose to leave rather than stay for this Adjournment debate.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, for attending but it is regrettable that the senior Minister did not choose to stay here to deal with this debate.  Unfortunately, that has been a feature of the way in which she has dealt with this issue since it first arose.  It seems impossible to pin her down.  A number of requests by Deputy Broughan and I and other members of the Labour Party have been made for a meeting to deal with this urgent situation.  Unfortunately, she has not seen fit to agree to that.Like other representatives on the north side of Dublin, I have a deep concern at what is happening at the airport.  There were more than 1,100 highly-skilled, good-quality, high net worth jobs in the airport.  The outfit was very successful, as Team Aer Lingus first, then as FLS and more recently has SR Technics.The jobs are important to the to the region, and the downstream jobs that arose because of this quality employment are too numerous to mention.  Those jobs are in serious jeopardy.  The company was very successful and it had a fine facility at Dublin doing excellent work with a first class safety record.

The decision was taken by people with no loyalty to this country, no consideration of the downstream effect of the decision on the region and no consideration by the Minister.  It will affect the entire north Dublin region.  It appears there was one brief meeting before the announcement was made. What happened at that meeting and did the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, make any serious attempt to hold on to the jobs?  I do not believe she did.The management told us at the time that the reason they were pulling out was because costs were 20% over what they regarded as acceptable.  What was done about that and what opportunity was given to deal with those overruns in costs?  Those jobs could have been saved if the Minister had made a serious effort.  I call on the Minister at this late stage to get the finger out, speak to the management in SR Technics and do everything she possibly can to protect and maintain those jobs for the north side of Dublin.  We cannot afford to lose them.

I thank the Deputies for raising the matter and I know the Tánaiste's office has been in contact with Deputy Broughan in the context of arranging a meeting next week to discuss the issue.  All Members of the Dáil know well the impact that job losses have on a community, individuals and families.  These job losses will have a major impact on the employees and the broader community.  Fianna Fáil members also had a meeting tonight to discuss this issue so everybody on all sides of the House shares the concerns of the Deputies opposite.The Government learned about the closure of SR Technics recently, although the company's operation in Cork, which employs approximately 200 persons, remains unaffected.  The Tánaiste met with representatives of the company on 11 February, along with the Secretary General of the Department and the chief executive officer of IDA Ireland.  A number of meetings had taken place between State officials, agencies and the company in the past year.  The company explained that it had been exploring all options for its Dublin operations, including a sale to another party.  Unfortunately, it was determined that it was not possible to proceed with any of these options.The company explained the global deterioration that had taken place in its business since mid-2008, with contracts moving to eastern Europe, Jordan, Turkey and Malta.  The company confirmed that it was putting in place a five-year restructuring plan and that it had already reduced its worldwide workforce by 500 in the past year.  The company stated that the recent loss of major contracts, current business and economic forecasts, along with the high cost base and over-capacity at Dublin Airport, made it impossible to continue a sustainable business in Dublin.

This is a long-term contract awarded by Aer Lingus in 2008 following a competitive procurement process.  The company has indicated that it hopes to assign this and other smaller operations to another operator, which offers the potential of saving up to 200 jobs.  Pending the outcome of negotiations on this issue, the company could not give the Tánaiste a definitive figure on the actual number of jobs likely to be saved.  However, SR Technics will continue the line maintenance operations for the present.IDA Ireland has had an ongoing relationship with the company over many years and approved a significant training grant package for the company in 2006 to assist it in maximising efficiencies and improving competitiveness.  IDA also had discussions with the company on its business plan and further opportunities to assist the company with additional financial incentives such as research and development support with the emphasis on innovation and process development.The Tánaiste will also be meeting union representatives to hear their concerns and to consider any proposals which they might have, and any assistance which the State development agencies, under her auspices, might be able to provide.  This is in addition to supporting the workers in finding new employment, including assistance to re-skill and retrain to enhance their future employment potential.  Any involvement by the State agencies, IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland——

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	700	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important issue.  When the county enterprise boards were first set up, I happened to be a member of the local authority in south Tipperary and was nominated to the county enterprise board.  I saw at first hand, in very difficult times, the role the board could play within the community.  I know people who started industries which are now employing 150 people, with one in particular that came to the county enterprise board for a feasibility study.  That young man was unemployed but now has 150 people in one of his several companies.The county enterprise role is a very good model to support the many unemployed people and those losing their jobs right across the country.  There are 400,000 to 500,000 people out of work nationally and in our constituency in Tipperary South there are 954 people on the live register in Cahir, 1,600 in Carrick-on-Suir, 1,900 in Clonmel, 818 in Cashel and 1,252 in Tipperary Town.  The numbers will increase in these areas because of the effect of Dell in Limerick announcing the shedding of many jobs.  That will have an impact in our part of the country.I remember when county enterprise boards were first set up.  They did really imaginative work to help many people with various skills to initiate businesses.  Many people need help, whether it is with accounts, available grants or rules, laws and regulations.  Such skilled people have ideas and can set up and run a company.  There is a real role for the county enterprise boards, using FÁS, to act as the catalyst in helping people with banking or accounting skills, for example.  The number might not be substantial but there is real potential in these people.  Services are required and there is significant opportunity there.This must be done in co-operation with FÁS and if that body could be tied in with the process, it would be a great way of helping people establish their own businesses.  This could happen in the food area, as I come from a county that is rich in its food products.  There is a need to expand concepts such as market garden farming and the country markets, which are increasing in number around the country.  There is also the tourist element.  The potential of the county enterprise boards is significant.I ask the Minister to implement this as a policy to help people who are unemployed but who want to stay in this country and have an idea which could be brought to fruition.  Regardless of the help these people require, it could be a very cost-effective process.  The structures exist and the models are in every county.  With a bit of co-ordination and support, we could do a great job in helping people in these dire times.  People are frightened but they want to help the economy and get up on their own.  They want to rear their families themselves rather than come to the Government looking for something.  This would give such people a start.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	701	We are in the most challenging economic environment that has confronted our nation in modern times.  The Government has acknowledged this and has embarked on addressing this situation in a concerted fashion.  The Government focused on safeguarding the financial system so that it could continue to operate to sustain the real economy and in particular contribute positively to the enterprise sector.  Government action on the banks guarantee scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the recapitalisation scheme has been timely, proportionate and essential.Under the recapitalisation scheme, AIB and Bank of Ireland have committed to increasing their lending capacity to small and medium enterprises by 10%.  As part of the package, the Financial Regulator has introduced a code of conduct for business lending to small and medium enterprises which will facilitate lending to small and medium enterprises and promote greater transparency in the treatment of small and medium enterprises by the banks.  The code extends beyond AIB and Bank of Ireland and covers the primary lending banks.In our document Building Ireland's Smart Economy, the Government put forward a framework for sustainable economic renewal.  This document sets out actions to reorganise the economy over the next five years to secure the prosperity of current and future generations.  Central to our economic renewal is a thriving enterprise sector, high-quality employment, secure energy supplies, an attractive environment and first class infrastructure.  The Government is also addressing public spending in terms of bridging the gap between budgetary demands and Exchequer inflows and focusing on how to achieve significant savings.  We have already made decisions on measures to effect savings of €2 billion in 2009.All of these measures will sustain our economy and ensure that we are well positioned for the economic upturn when it arises.  These efforts will directly assist enterprise activity within the economy, particularly at the level of small and medium-sized enterprises.  The Government is committed to ensuring that we continue to put in place policies and programmes that encourage the emergence of new business opportunities and facilitate long-term business survival.The 35 county and city enterprise boards have a clearly defined role as the principal deliverers of State support to the micro-enterprise sector in Ireland.  This sector is a key component of the indigenous small business sector and has been to the forefront of Ireland's recent economic success.  As a result of their strong regional and cumulatively national presence, the network of county enterprise boards is providing a seamless availability of business support, funding and mentoring to the micro-enterprise sector, thus facilitating the growth of this sector over the last 15 years.  In addition, the micro-enterprises supported by the enterprise boards have played a key role in providing the sub-supply and support services that are essential in attracting foreign direct investment into the county.The enterprise boards have an excellent track record in tapping into local entrepreneurial potential and their focus has increasingly been on the development of sustainable growth-orientated local enterprise, which can deliver high quality job creation without displacement or deadweight.  The current parameters within which the enterprise boards operate enable them to deliver valuable assistance to business start-ups with good growth and employment potential.  Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support, the boards have assisted many micro-enterprises in developing their growth and export potential as well as bringing them to a stage where they have sufficient mass to access the services of Enterprise Ireland.Since 1993 to the end of 2008, the CEBs have issued grant payments to the total value of €201,159,002 and since their establishment in 1993, the total number of projects which have been approved for financial assistance is 20,796.  Over 33,811 net jobs were created in CEB assisted enterprises from 1993 until the end of 2008The enterprise boards have, in particular, deepened their role in promoting a culture of entrepreneurship in their localities.  The provision of management capability training, direct mentoring and of networking opportunities carries its own value and its own weight.  Over 165,700 people have participated on the various management development programmes and mentoring programmes available from the county enterprise boards since 1993.  This represents a significant financial investment by this State in the micro-enterprise sector for the last 16 years and is also an investment in the future development of this sector.  All of this contributes to job creation by boosting the survival rate among micro businesses and facilitating the future growth and employment potential of those businesses.In 2009 the enterprise boards will continue to deliver on their primary role of assisting and supporting the micro-enterprise sector through the provision of both direct grant aid and soft support measures and to ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.  While the current climate surrounding public finances cannot be ignored, enterprise boards will be able to use their available funding in a judicious and effective manner so as to ensure that business growth and development will not suffer and that further employment creation opportunities are not missed.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	702	Suicide among Travellers was up to five times more common than for the rest of the population during 2000-06 according to the first study of its kind to take place in Ireland.  The research also discovered that suicide most often follows the death of someone close to the victim.  The loss of Traveller identity and culture among younger members of the community may also play a part in suicide rates.  According to the study, the age group most at risk is 25 to 29.The report, which was prepared by Ms Mary Rose Walker of Wicklow County Council and launched by the Wicklow Traveller Interagency Group in December, is unique in that it covered the entire Traveller population over a seven year period, gathering information regarding family circumstances and underlying issues concerning the subjects of the research.  The sources of data included local authority social workers for Travellers, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government annual statistics, the national Traveller population and the CSO.The main findings of the report were that between 2000 and 2006, the suicide rate among Irish Travellers was 3.7 per 10,000, more than three times that of the total population.  It peaked in 2005 when it was over five times the national rate.Suicide is predominantly a male issue among Travellers.  For the total population male suicide is four times more common than female, but for Travellers male suicide makes up 91% of suicides, more than nine times as common as female suicide.Of those who died, 52% were never married, while a further 15% were separated or widowed.  Over 65% of Traveller suicides occurred among those aged under 30.  The age group most at risk for Travellers was 25 to 29, accounting for 26% of Traveller suicides.  Suicide among Travellers aged 40 and over, at 12%, is relatively infrequent compared to the total population, where it is 46%.  Almost 80% die by hanging with poisoning being the second most commonly used method by the Travelling community to take their lives, at 9%.Accommodation does not seem to be a significant factor except that roadside Travellers are at a greater risk of suicide while rates are lower for those in houses, particularly group housing or privately owned or rented housing.  In almost 70% of instances, it was the first attempt at suicide, a fact of significant concern to service providers.The background in many of the suicides was one of major social difficulty, with a life characterised by alcohol or substance abuse, violent behaviour and a history of self-harm or suicide attempts.  People found themselves in a situation where there was no future.  The question is not why they had died but how they had managed to stay alive for so long.  The report also referred to people who had suffered a considerable degree of hardship and tragedy in a short space of time that would render even the most resilient of people vulnerable to suicide.There were also motiveless suicides, where the individual showed no sign of suicidal ideation and had none of the risk factors typically associated with suicide, such as depression, alcohol or substance abuse.  There appeared to be no reason for the decision and their loved ones spoke of their incredible anguish, unable to understand why these people had chosen to end their lives.  With both motiveless and troubled suicide categories found in any group in society, the most common pattern that emerged through the research is that of the Traveller who takes his own life, usually by hanging, following the death of someone close.  It is of concern that in 40% of cases where a Traveller took his or her life following the death of someone close, that death was also a suicide, and that 40% of those who died following the death of a loved one also died by suicide.Violence, whether domestic or feud-related, was reported as a contributory factor in 40 cases of suicide, with eight deaths occurring following a violent episode, with four being victims and four being perpetrators.  There were also "shame" suicides, that took place following disclosure of an alleged criminal act or while awaiting trial for a criminal act.  In general, the older the individual, the more serious the act was likely to be.  The view of the respondents was that the pressure of this shame motivated the people to kill themselves.The research also looked at why the rate of suicide should be so high in recent years.  Ms Walker concluded that:Today, young Travellers have a lot more in common with their settled peers than their parents' generation did, and to a certain extent, there has been a loss of cultural traditions as they take on the values of mainstream society.  However, public opinion as Travellers as inferior and as a threat has not changed, and Travellers face huge rejection from the settlement population.  Some attempt to conceal their Traveller identity completely.  They are not fully accepted as part of settled society, they may no longer be firmly rooted in their own culture and social traditions, and they have lost pride in their own ethnic identity.Legal restrictions and economic reasons have made it increasingly difficult for Travellers to travel and to keep horses, both activities being central to Traveller culture.  For those without work, who have lost the traditions of travelling and keeping horses, there is nothing to do.  Particularly vulnerable are single young men.  To alleviate boredom, they may drink, take drugs, joyride and engage in other forms of anti-social behaviour.  All of these risktaking behaviours are associated with suicide.  It takes little to persuade somebody for whom life holds no interest to end theirs.With recent changes in society, Travellers have had to learn to cope with increased hostility, difficulty with identity, loss of culture and traditions and lack of purpose in life.  Given the existing vulnerabilities of Travellers today, factors such as alcohol or substance abuse, economic insecurity, violence, depression assume an additional risk level.  It may therefore not be surprising that an immediate crisis, such as death or conflict, can act as a trigger factor for suicide.I commend Wicklow County Council and Ms Mary Rose Walker on their research into this area.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, who sends her apologies as she was unable to take it herself.  I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter.  It provides a very timely opportunity to highlight all of our concerns about the high levels of suicide among the Traveller community.This is particularly relevant to this evening's debate.  In the past, much of the information relating to the issue of suicide among the Traveller community was based on anecdotal evidence.  In recent years research has been carried out which has aimed to identify the specific issues which need to be addressed when tackling suicide among this community.I refer in particular to two reports: Moving Beyond Coping, an insight into the experiences and needs of Travellers in dealing with the experience of suicide, launched in November 2006 by Tallaght Travellers Youth Service; and Suicide Among the Irish Traveller Community 2000-2006, launched on 9 December 2008 by the Wicklow Traveller Interagency Group and Wicklow County Council.The statistics in the Wicklow report are a stark reminder of the serious issue of suicide, with suicide rates among the Traveller community being three times higher than in non-Traveller communities.  Similar to the national trend, suicide in Travellers is predominantly male.  Importantly, however, both reports help to highlight ways in which we can tackle this tragic issue.  The Moving Beyond Coping report identifies the need to address Traveller mental health issues and depression in particular and it recognises the role of alcohol in suicide.  It also highlights the role education plays in assisting young Travellers to avail of equal opportunities in life.Suicide Among the Irish Traveller Community 2000-2006 indicates that the loss of Traveller identity and culture among younger members of the community may be a contributing factor.  These issues must inform suicide prevention initiatives for the Traveller community.  I am pleased to say that developments are ongoing in this regard.The National Office for Suicide Prevention funds a national Travellers' suicide prevention project officer to build on the work of Pavee Point and local Traveller groups.  The project is Traveller led and uses a community development approach in carrying out the work.  A strategic plan has been developed.  Key objectives for the programme include raising awareness around the issue of Traveller suicide and self harm; developing appropriate responses within the community; and working with national organisations to ensure culturally appropriate responses to suicidal behaviour within the Traveller community.I recognise the many challenges that lie ahead and I am aware that no interventions bring a guarantee of success.  International evidence shows that reducing the suicide rate and preventing suicides requires a collective, concerted effort on the part of all groups in society — health, social services and other professionals, communities, voluntary and statutory agencies and organisations, parents, friends and neighbours.I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to the implementation of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of our mental health services to prevent and reduce further tragic loss of life.  I assure the Deputy of the Department of Health and Children's commitment to this area.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this matter.  I hope we will be able soon to address this issue substantively at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Our next meeting is a select committee one and after that we have other business.  However, I hope that in a fortnight's time we might be able to accommodate a substantive discussion because many of the issues will not wait, in particular the vulnerability of children and the civilian population in the province of Vanni in northern Sri Lanka.Many civilians have lost their lives since 2006 when the 2002 ceasefire brokered by the Norwegian Government fell apart.  At least 7,000 people have been killed and more than 300,000 have been displaced.  This long running conflict between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil Tigers is one for which an incredible price has already been paid in terms of loss of life and displacement.An immediate unconditional ceasefire is necessary, as is an acceptance by both sides that there is no military solution to the conflict and that there is a need to return to the circumstances of the 2002 agreement and ceasefire.  That ceasefire was achieved on the basis of mutual respect and parity of esteem.  The tragic part of all of this is that the Tamil Tigers are suggesting to their civilian population, in particular children, that they must not move out of the area which they are in.  Where they have moved into government controlled areas, they have been subjected to aerial bombing and immense loss of life.  Civilians are at risk and have died in the area regarded as government controlled, which is unsustainable.  However, they are also at risk in the Tamil controlled areas.Another aspect which is very worrying is that the international press does not have access to the zones of conflict.  For example, organisations as different as CNN and al-Jazeera are not able to cover what is taking place.  Perhaps more importantly, some time ago all humanitarian agencies other than the International Red Cross and the United Nations World Food Programme were expelled from the areas.  The international community cannot see the conflict in its totality and the humanitarian agencies cannot go where they are most needed.What is needed at this stage and the reason I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter is for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to join with the German and the British foreign ministers to seek to have this matter addressed immediately at UN level and at EU foreign minister level to try to create circumstances where an unconditional and an open-ended ceasefire could come into being.  In raising this matter, I express my gratitude to those citizens in Ireland who have addressed this issue, in particular the Irish Forum for Peace in Sri Lanka which contacted me.  I hope the Minister of State will communicate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and regard this matter as urgent so that we put an end to the loss of life and the great vulnerability of the children in question.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs sends his apologies for being unable to attend to take the matter.The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made clear the Government's deep concern at the plight of the war-ravaged Tamil population in the north of Sri Lanka who are the innocent victims of the conflict between the Government of Sri Lanka and the rebel LTTE, or the Tamil Tigers.  Large numbers of men, women and children have been subjected to indiscriminate bombardment by government forces while there is evidence that the Tamil Tigers have been blocking their escape giving rise to allegations that they are using the civilians as human shields.  A report from UNICEF yesterday also confirms that the LTTE has intensified forcible recruitment of civilians and that children as young as 14 years old are now being targeted, thus placing their lives at great risk.  UNICEF also expresses its extreme alarm at the high number of children being injured in the fighting.  I fully endorse its demand that all civilians, especially children, must be given every protection from the fighting.Through our ambassador in New Delhi, we have made urgent humanitarian representations on behalf of all the innocent people who are suffering there, not failing to remember also the small religious communities who find themselves tragically caught in a conflict which is not of their making but from which they cannot escape.  The blatant disregard for the lives of innocent civilians which has been the norm since the intensification of the conflict over the past two months represents a serious breach of international humanitarian law.Both the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE should agree to an immediate ceasefire.  The priority would be to allow unrestricted access to the affected areas by the emergency services, including the ICRC and other humanitarian organisations, so that aid and supplies can be delivered as quickly as possible and that the sick and injured can be evacuated.  However, a short term temporary ceasefire is not enough.  Although the Sri Lankan Government now seems close to a military victory, a lasting peace settlement will require reconciliation and a political process aimed at protecting the interests of all Sri Lankan citizens and enshrining the principle of parity of esteem among its divided communities.To this end, the international community should continue to exercise as much pressure as possible.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will attend Monday's meeting of the EU's General Affairs and External Relations Council, which will issue important conclusions on the conflict in Sri Lanka.  We hope that an EU Troika visit to the country at ministerial level will take place shortly to convey the EU's very serious concerns about the conflict and the humanitarian situation in the country.  The Commission has also initiated an examination of whether the Government of Sri Lanka has breached the terms of the human rights provisions in the EU's GSP Plus trade agreement with Sri Lanka.At the national level, Ireland has consistently taken every opportunity to call for meaningful peace talks and an end to all violence and human rights violations.  Consultations with other governments, including with the Government of Norway, which acted as the central facilitator of the ceasefire agreement before it collapsed in January last year, will continue.  If the relevant parties seek any advice in regard to a negotiated peace process, we would give consideration as to how we could best help.Since 2005, the Government has provided, through Irish Aid, more than €5.3 million for humanitarian and development activities in Sri Lanka.  In addition, more than US$12 million was allocated from the UN's central emergency response fund to Sri Lanka during 2008.  Ireland is currently the seventh largest donor to this fund.In addition to unearmarked funding to the Red Cross, one of the key organisations at the centre of the response to the humanitarian crisis, Irish Aid is monitoring closely the humanitarian situation in northern Sri Lanka and the provision of emergency funding is under consideration.  I will convey the Deputy's views directly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Indeed, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank was a manifestation of this principle.As I have indicated previously, the decision to nationalise Anglo was taken following the weakening of its funding position and unacceptable corporate governance practices which caused the bank serious reputational damage.As Minister for Finance, I am in possession of detailed information on the bank, arising from the original PriceWaterhouseCoopers report commissioned by the Financial Regulator and the Due Diligence exercise carried out on my behalf in early January.  Much of this information is commercially sensitive, related to customers of the bank, or is the subject of an investigation by a statutory authority.The decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank was recommended to me by the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the NTMA and my legal and financial advisors.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	707	The Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible for the regulation and supervision of credit unions under the Credit Union Act, 1997.  The Registrar's statutory role under the Act relates to the supervision and oversight of the financial position and activities of credit unions on an ongoing basis.  The Registrar reports regularly to the Regulatory Authority in order to ensure that there is an early identification and response to any significant issues relating to the credit union movement or any individual credit union.As the Deputy will recognise the current economic downturn is adversely affecting the loan books of all financial institutions including credit unions.  It is, however, important to make the point that the credit union movement has not been a significant participant in property lending in the economy and the movement, is therefore, not in overall terms significantly exposed to this type of lending.  In that context the Registrar of Credit Unions does not collect aggregate data on debts due to credit unions specifically related to property lending.My Department has, however, been advised by the Registrar of Credit Unions that he is aware from his engagement with some individual credit unions that there is some exposure in this area.  In addition, while a proportion of this lending has experienced impairments it is probable that further impairments will occur in this regard during 2009 and beyond on account of the deterioration in the economic environment overall.  More generally, the Registrar has informed my Department that loan arrears in credit unions have increased in the year to end-2008.  Information extracted from the prudential returns for December 2008 indicates that provision for bad debt was €284 million.  Bad debt provisions at 3.9% of total loans at end-2008 show an increase of 0.3% on the December 2007 figure.The Deputy may wish to note that the Registrar of Credit Unions liaises with my Department on a regular basis in relation to the legislative and policy framework for credit unions.  In addition, my Department meets separately with the Credit Union representative bodies on a regular basis.  I have not met personally with these representatives in the last three months.

The Financial Regulator informed me following my enquiry of the movement of the former Chairman's loans to the Irish Nationwide Building Society prior to Anglo Irish Bank's year end and the practice in that regard over the previous seven years.As I have already stated, the practices which took place in relation to these loans were unacceptable.  The matter is the subject of investigations by both the Financial Regulator and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, and will be dealt with appropriately.The Financial Regulator is also investigating director's loans at all institutions covered under the Guarantee Scheme, to ensure that any other such instances are identified.  I am not aware at this stage of any other instances of inappropriate treatment of director loans by other financial institutions covered by the bank guarantee.  Breaches of regulatory or legal requirements in relation to director's loans will be dealt with in accordance with the law.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	709	The position in relation to National Lottery funding is that receipts from the sale of National Lottery tickets are deposited in the National Lottery Fund in the Central Bank.  A portion of these funds is transferred by my Department into the Exchequer over the course of each year on the basis of the projected surplus for that year.  The moneys transferred into the Exchequer are entered as non-tax revenue and, as such, form part of the general pool of revenue out of which expenditure is financed.Since 2005, the total allocation for subheads which had formerly been funded entirely from the proceeds of the National Lottery has exceeded the funds available from the National Lottery.  The total amount of funding is determined in the Estimates process, and is paid out of the general pool of revenue of which National Lottery proceeds form part.  Subheads that prior to 2005 were exclusively funded by National Lottery funds are now funded by a combination of National Lottery and Exchequer funding, the total amounts vary from subhead to subhead depending on the outcome of the Estimates process.  It is not, therefore, possible to indicate the percentage of Lottery funding which was included in the allocations provided in 2006, 2007 and 2008 for subheads that are partly funded by the National Lottery including the Irish Sports Council and the Arts Council.  Funds from the National Lottery as a percentage of the total allocation for all subheads which are part-funded by the proceeds of the National Lottery amounted to 56% in 2006, 52% in 2007 and 57% in 2008.Under the legislation, the allocation of funding among the categories is a matter for the Government.  There is no specific formula for the allocation of funding among categories.  The Government decides on an annual basis how the surplus from the National Lottery is to be allocated in the context of the overall Estimates process.The allocation for the Irish Sports Council in the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 as a percentage of total expenditure on subheads part-funded by the National Lottery is as follows:Year%200611200712200812The allocation for the Arts Council in the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 as a percentage of total expenditure on subheads part-funded by the National Lottery is as follows:Year%200620200718200818Funds from the National Lottery as a percentage of the total allocation for all subheads which are part-funded by the proceeds of the National Lottery is as follows:Year%200656200752200857

Reflecting the weak economic climate that exists, my Department now expects tax revenue for 2009 of about €37 billion.  This represents a 9¼ per cent decline in revenue, which would be the second year that taxes have contracted.The Addendum also forecast Gross Voted expenditure for 2009 of €56.5 billion.  On the basis of this forecast the Government last week decided on a package of savings measures to raise €2 billion in a full year basis.  The precise details of individual Vote allocations are currently being finalised in consultation with Departments and will be included in the upcoming Revised Estimates Volume 2009, to be published in mid-March.  A General Government deficit of approximately 9½ per cent of GDP is forecast for 2009.The end-January Exchequer Returns showed an Exchequer deficit of just over €747 million and tax receipts, at €3,735 million, down 19% year-on-year.  However, it must be taken into account that tax revenue in January 2008 was relatively strong.  In this regard, tax receipts for January 2009 represent approximately 10% of the forecast receipts for the year and this is in line with the percentage received in previous years.  In addition, the Budget 2009 changes to Income tax (the introduction of the 1% income levy) and VAT (the increase on the standard rate to 21.5%) are not, due to the normal lags in the collection times, fully reflected in these figures.  Consequently, the January 2009 figures are generally in line with expectations.My Department will publish monthly profiles of expected tax revenue receipts by the end of this month.  However, it is still too early in the year to draw any firm conclusions regarding the end-year outturn.  As is the norm, my Department will closely monitor incoming receipts and I will keep the Government informed of any emerging trends.

The Irish Government took the decisive and final step of nationalising Anglo Irish Bank because of concerns about governance issues and the market confidence in Anglo Irish Bank.  In light of these concerns the Government felt that recapitalisation was no longer the appropriate and effective means to secure Anglo's continued viability.  Anglo was taken into State ownership only as a final step to protect the banks position and the stability of the financial sector generally.The Deputy is aware, I announced on 11 February the terms to be offered to Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.  This followed from the earlier Government announcement of 21 December 2008.  The recapitalisation package was recommended to me by the Governor of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, my financial advisors and the National Treasury Management Agency.The Government has made it clear that the recapitalisation terms announced last week make provision for the Banks to repurchase the shares.  The State will receive preference shares with a fixed dividend of 8% payable in cash or ordinary shares in lieu.  The State will also get 25% of total ordinary voting rights in respect of change of control and board appointments.  Furthermore, the recapitalised banks have reconfirmed their commitment to an extensive credit package which will help to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009.  The credit package also provides for a €100m environmental and clean energy innovation fund to be established by each bank.All the steps taken by the Government are to ensure that the public interest is secured so that the financial system in Ireland meets the everyday financial needs of individuals, businesses and the overall economy.

With effect from 20 December 2001, the pension system for part-time employees was modified to a pro-rata basis, by reference to the remuneration of whole-time employees.With effect from 1 January 2004, a new system of calculating pensions for employees insured for full PRSI was introduced.  This new system delivers increased pensions to members of public service pension schemes whose full-time salary is less than 3 1/3 times the Contributory State Pension (CSP).The new integration formula takes into account the value of the Contributory State Pension (CSP) in calculating occupational pensions.  The method of calculating a pension for public service employees who qualify for benefits on or after 1 January 2004 is:(a) For that part of the employee's pensionable remuneration which is less than or equal to 3 1/3 times the current rate of CSP, 1/200th of pensionable remuneration multiplied by the number of years of reckonable service plus(b) For any part of the employee's Pensionable Remuneration which exceeds 3 1/3 times CSP, 1/80th of pensionable remuneration multiplied by the number of years of reckonable service.The maximum number of years of reckonable service is 40.  The new formula is used in all cases of retirement on or after 1 January 2004.  In addition, pensions in course of payment on 1 January 2004 were revised by reference to the new formula in cases where this produced an improvement for the pensioner.The revised system improved the position for people on lower rates of pay and ensured that every person who meets the requirements of the pension scheme gets an occupational pension, regardless of income.It is proposed that the new pension related deduction will confer no additional pension benefit and that it will be deducted from gross pay before income tax, PRSI and health levies are calculated.  As the new integration system ensures that every person who meets the eligibility criteria of the pension scheme gets an occupational pension, regardless of income, there are no direct consequences to the interaction of the pension related deduction with the integration system.

Obviously, the particular type of project will influence the practicality of delivery in several stages.  For example, construction of the Major-Inter-Urban routes has taken place over several stages but this may not be feasible for all major capital infrastructure projects.

However, reflecting the fact that the fiscal forecasts were revised at the beginning of January, with a decline in tax revenue this year of 9¼% now anticipated, my Department is still working on finalising the profiles for 2009. I expect these tax profiles to be published before the end of the month.In relation to projected Exchequer expenditures, the Government has recently announced various measures required to adjust the overall expenditure levels.  In this regard, my Department is working with other Departments to produce revised expenditure numbers.  It is the intention to produce a monthly profile towards the end of this month, consistent with the revised budgetary projections and with the allocations to be presented in the 2009 Revised Estimates Volume.The end-January Exchequer Returns showed an Exchequer deficit of just over €747 million and tax receipts, at €3,735 million, down 19% year-on-year.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	715	As the Deputy will be aware the level of impairment of  assets in financial institutions  has, from the outset, been a key consideration in the assessment of the risks and the appropriate interventions by Government required to address and correct the particular difficulties being faced by  financial institutions in Ireland.The Financial Regulator engaged PriceWaterHouse Coopers to examine the capital position of the institutions covered under the Guarantee Scheme.  This examination included an assessment of the level of impairment of assets under various stress scenarios.  A further assessment of the market values of land and development assets was carried out by Jones Lang LaSalle to complement this work.The provision of the Guarantee stabilised the liquidity position for the covered institutions and provided confidence to depositors in the institutions.  The recapitalisation of AIB and BOI addresses both the expectations of international markets on the Irish bank's capital levels, and strengthens the ability of institutions to cope with impaired loans in conjunction existing reserves and retained profit from performing loans and other trading activities.I will continue to examine various proposals, such as risk insurance, for the management and reduction of risks within financial institutions with respect to these specific exposures, having regard to international developments and to the best interests of the taxpayer.  Ongoing work at the level of the European Central Bank and in the EU will inform the process.In the context of the six month review of the guarantee scheme to be completed by mid-April 2009 the Government will examine how the Scheme could be revised subject to European Commission approval and consistent with EU State aid requirements, in ways which include supporting longer-term bond issuance by the covered institutions.  This would be in line with international and EU trends where the average term of State cover for bond issues extends beyond 2010.  To date the Government's approach is structured and incremental and designed to ensure that the interests of the banks, the financial sector generally and the State are protected.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	716	As the deputy is aware, there have been several changes in recent weeks to the Boards and Management of several of the Irish financial institutions.  In Anglo Irish Bank, in particular where the State is a shareholder, the Board appointed by me will ensure that every step possible is being taken to develop the highest standards of corporate governance and to protect the taxpayers' interest.The implementation of the Bank Guarantee Scheme, announced in September 2008, has given rise to detailed engagement with the banks.  In the period since September I have, along with my Department, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the NTMA, worked with the covered financial institutions to examine all options to maintain stability and the proper functioning of the banking system.  This process has been comprehensive and structured, addressing such issues as the business plans of the banks, potential private investment, financial market expectations, and the role of the banks in supporting the real economy.  This process will continue with all of the covered institutions to ensure that the objectives of the Scheme are met, including ensuring financial stability and minimising any potential cost to the Exchequer and taxpayers.With respect to Anglo, the Board is preparing a comprehensive business plan which will be required to demonstrate how the Board will oversee the continued commercial operation of the bank in the best interests of the bank, the financial sector generally and the State.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 99 together.My Department's latest inflation forecasts were published on 9 January as part of the Addendum to the Stability Programme Update.  These showed that CPI inflation was expected to turn negative in the first quarter of 2009 and average -1.0% for the year as a whole.  For HICP inflation, an annual average in the region of ½% was forecast for 2009.These forecasts pre-dated the ECB announcement of a half percentage point decrease in interest rates on 15 January.  Factoring in this rate cut, along with more recent data, would imply an average CPI inflation rate of around -2.0% in 2009.  Taking account of the latest data would imply a broadly flat rate of HICP inflation in 2009.The current and prospective easing in inflation will have both positive and negative effects.  It will lead to an increase in households' purchasing power, thus helping those on tighter budgets, and this is to be welcomed.  That said, falling prices also means an increase in the real value of debt.However, to the extent that the latter situation materialises, a number of factors will help to mitigate the effects.  These include the substantial interest rate cuts of recent months and the range of measures that the Government has put in place to support households experiencing difficulties in meeting mortgage payments.  For example, the Mortgage Interest Supplement provides assistance where the mortgage relates to the sole place of residence, while the Money Advice and Budgeting Service is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt, or, in danger of falling into debt.The Deputy will also be aware of the new mandatory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  This incorporates a requirement for the lender to wait at least six months from the time arrears arise before taking legal action.  In terms of the two recapitalised banks, I would point out that these will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing, where the customer maintains contact and cooperates reasonably and honestly with the bank.  In addition, the recapitalised banks have assured the Government that in the normal course they will make every effort to avoid repossessions, as evidenced by the low level of repossessions by them to date.  So while there are some negative aspects to falling prices, the general easing of price pressures will assist in regaining some of the loss of competitiveness that we have suffered in recent years.

I would envisage that if the VER in the health sector is approved by Government, it would be adopted as a model for the wider public service where surplus staff are identified and an accelerated reduction in employment numbers is required.In my Budget Statement on 14 October last, I announced that the Government had decided to proceed with the implementation of 30 rationalisation proposals spread across 11 Government Departments.  The details of the rationalisations, which will result in a reduction of 41 bodies, were set out in Annex D of the Summary Budget Measures.Implementation of these rationalisation proposals, which are a matter for the relevant parent Government Departments, is a complex exercise; it involves amalgamating bodies, reassigning legislative and administrative functions, and discontinuing bodies in some cases.  To date, ten of the 30 rationalisation decisions have been implemented, covering nine State agencies and the decision to close four Army barracks.  I understand that a further 8 decisions will be implemented in full in 2009.  While the savings involved continue to emerge, the completed rationalisations of State agencies is expected to deliver savings of at least €2 million and the closure of the Army barracks savings of the order of €2.5 million over three years, with annual savings thereafter of €2.5 million.While cost-savings and economy are important, I wish to emphasise that alongside major savings in administrative overheads including staff numbers, a key outcome of this process is to deliver a more citizen-friendly system of government with better, more focused delivery of services.

In addition, the Central Bank and Financial Regulator are consulted on the implementation of the Scheme on an ongoing basis.Since January, myself and/or my officials have met and corresponded with the chief executive of Bank of Ireland, the chief executive of AIB, the chief executive of EBS and the former chief executive of Irish Life & Permanent.

On foot of the revised projections, the Government has taken substantive immediate action to address the fiscal and economic situation by setting out the details of the expenditure savings of up to €2 billion in a full year.  The Government has also signalled that further fiscal consolidation measures will be necessary in the period 2010-2013 and that these adjustments will, as necessary, include measures to reduce and prioritise expenditure and to adjust taxation levels to reflect the changed realities.  The work of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes and that of the Commission on Taxation will inform decisions taken by the Government in this regard.At this stage the Government's focus is on securing the recently announced expenditure savings which are part of the overall Government fiscal strategy.  Regarding the date of next year's Budget, while it is usual practice to have the Budget in early December, this is a decision taken by Government in the context of agreeing the Budget Strategy Memorandum which is usually taken by Government in late June/early July.

I understand, however, that a number of Irish financial institutions have submitted applications to access the facility.  In mid-January 2009, Bank of Scotland (Ireland) announced that it had concluded an agreement to access €50 million from this fund.  It is my understanding that negotiations are ongoing between other Irish financial institutions and the EIB, which hopefully can be finalised shortly.  This is an important initiative from the EIB and I would strongly urge the Irish financial institutions to utilise the facility to the maximum extent possible with a view to making the additional funding involved available to SMEs as soon as possible.

They have committed to increase lending capacity to small to medium enterprises by 10% and to providing an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs.A €100m environmental and clean energy innovation fund is also being established by each bank as well as a further €15m each to new or existing seed capital funds.  Much of this funding will flow to small businesses.In addition, the banks have agreed to engage in a ‘clearing group' chaired by a Government representative and including representation from business interests and State agencies.  The purpose of this group will be to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable projects appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.The recapitalised banks have also agreed to fund and co-operate with an independent review of credit availability which will be managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives and will report within five weeks.A Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February.  This code applies to all regulated banks and building societies and will ensure that they assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner.  The Code also requires banks to offer annual review meetings, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints.As  part of the recapitalisation banks have promised to actively promote new lending.  This has been evidenced by recent press and TV advertisements.

The Government and I attach the highest importance to strengthening that relationship and in consolidating and growing the economic partnership between our two countries.That partnership has contributed enormously to the very significant trade and investment ties with the Unites States.  These ties benefit us both and generate investment and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.  In that respect it is worth noting that while US companies employ in excess of 95,000 people in Ireland, Irish companies now employ in excess of 80,000 people across the United States.The Government and I are always mindful of the need to continually update and renew the links between our two countries.  This is especially important at this time in terms of the new US Administration.  In that respect I want to assure the Deputy that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, through the Embassy in Washington, has been monitoring and responding to all proposals for policy initiatives which could potentially impact on the Irish economy.My own Department and the IDA also work in close collaboration with the Embassy in seeking to address various policy proposals including those in relation to taxation which could affect foreign direct investment in Ireland.  Issues that may have implications for Ireland are subject to focused discussion with US policymakers within the overall framework of a shared commitment to promoting the consolidation and growth of our economic relationship.There has been a lot of discussion around the potential impact on Ireland of changes in US international taxation policy.  The fact of the matter is that the new Administration has not given any real indication of its main focus in terms of international taxation.  However, any re-evaluation cannot ignore the substantial real two-way investment between our countries nor indeed the importance of international taxation policy to the competitiveness of US companies seeking to grow their business in Europe and beyond.  We will be working to ensure that such considerations feed into the new Administration's deliberations in terms of the development of its international taxation policy.

This Due Diligence covered all aspects of Anglo's business, including the bank's liabilities and its banking practices.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government made it clear when nationalising Anglo Irish Bank that an important factor in reaching this decision related to concerns over corporate governance issues and market confidence in the bank.It would not be appropriate for me to comment on or prejudge the outcome of the investigations which are now being conducted by the Financial Regulator and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in relation to corporate governance issues at Anglo.  However, as Minister for Finance and shareholder, I will ensure where appropriate that any issues identified on foot of these investigations are properly addressed.Furthermore, the new Board of Anglo is reviewing all the corporate governance practices of the bank and will put arrangements in place to guide the bank in the future. I am confident that the new Board will pursue the necessary changes in this regard.

All non-life insurance companies that hold an authorisation and whose head office is in the State must produce to the Financial Regulator an annual account covering the types of operation specified in the Schedule to Statutory Instrument 202 of 1995.  For life assurance companies, under Statutory Instrument 360 of 1994, an insurance undertaking whose head office is situated in the State must furnish to the Financial Regulator annually, or more frequently if requested, statistical documents to verify the state of solvency of the undertaking.The Financial Regulator has further advised that since 30 September 2008 for life companies and 31 December 2008 for non-life companies all insurance companies have been requested to submit quarterly information to the Financial Regulator via a new online reporting system.  Companies are given one month in which to submit their quarterly information.  These quarterly forms which are less detailed than annual returns focus primarily on the solvency of the companies.  Newly authorised companies are required as a condition of authorisation to submit quarterly information.  Monthly reporting has only been requested in a limited number of cases where the situation of the firm would merit it.  The Financial Regulator has informed me that returns are generally submitted within deadline and in the rare event that the returns are late, an explanation is promptly sought from the company.Finally, the Financial Regulator has informed me that it is not able to comment on whether individual firms have failed to meet the disclosure requirements as under Section 33AK of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act, 2003 (which deals with disclosure of information) it is not permitted to do so.

The exceptional rainfall in 2008 exacerbated the flooding in the area, which is caused mainly by the extremely flat gradient of the river.  This makes it very difficult to devise a cost-effective solution.  I saw the problem at first hand when I visited the area with my officials on 12 September last, in the company of the IFA President, Pádraig Walshe, and local farmers and public representatives.The Office of Public Works carried out some clearance of vegetation in the area in early summer 2007, which, although not sufficient to prevent the flooding last year, is generally acknowledged to have improved the situation.  This work was carried out with the agreement of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and in consultation with other stakeholders.There is a proposal to remove silt from the Shannon Cut to try to improve the situation further.  Although OPW has some reservations as to how effective this will be, it is prepared to undertake a pilot project to test the efficacy of the measure, provided it is possible to do so in a cost-effective and environmentally acceptable manner.  Preliminary discussions with the National Parks and Wildlife Service have raised a number of issues.  OPW is endeavouring to arrange a meeting of the various stakeholders at the earliest possible date, with a view to securing agreement to proceed with the pilot project.The long-term management of summer flooding of the Callows will have to have regard to the availability of resources in addition to environmental constraints, and these issues will be considered in the course of the development of a Flood Risk Management Plan for the Shannon River Basin, which will be prepared in accordance with the EU Floods Directive.

The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls, manages and invests the assets of the Fund, to which the Exchequer contributes an amount equivalent to 1% of GNP each year, in accordance with the Fund's investment policy.On 11 February 2009, I announced details of a scheme designed to recapitalise the two main Irish banks, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.  The recapitalisation programme will be funded from the NPRF. €4 billion will come from the Fund's current resources while €3 billion will be provided by means of a frontloading of the Exchequer contributions for 2009 and 2010.  The necessary amending legislation to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 will be introduced shortly.As part of this scheme, the NPRF will acquire a significant number of preference shares in the two institutions involved.  The shares will pay a fixed dividend of 8% payable in cash or ordinary shares in lieu.  These shares can be repurchased at par up to the fifth anniversary of issue and at 125% of face value thereafter.  Warrants attached to the preference shares give an option to purchase up to 25% of the existing ordinary shares of each bank calculated on a post-dilution basis.I expect that this participation by the NPRF in the recapitalisation exercise will yield a satisfactory return for the Fund over time and will assist the Fund in its purpose of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions, to which the Fund will start to contribute in 2025.

The Government is committed to providing a platform for a well regulated, profitable banking industry of high repute in Ireland that operates in a national and international financial services environment.  Our vision for the banking sector is that the banks will serve borrowers, small and medium sized enterprises and all stakeholders in an honest way and ensure that customers and consumers in particular are treated in a reputable and respectable way.The Minister for Finance is advised on banking issues by the Governor of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, independent financial advisors, the National Treasury Management Agency and by senior officials in his Department.  Taking account of the advice received the Government has proceeded with a comprehensive recapitalisation of Ireland's two main banks and with the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  The Government is also in discussions with the other covered institutions, Irish Life & Permanent, Educational Building Society and Irish National Building Society concerning their respective positions.The Bank Guarantee Scheme introduced last September and the bank customer package which has accompanied recapitalisation will further reinforce the stability of our financial system and increase confidence in our banks' ability to contribute to the economy.It is also evident that our financial regulatory regime needs to adjust to the new realities.  Work has begun on reforming the system.  I have asked the Boards of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulatory Authority for their views on the approach to financial regulation in Ireland.At EU level, new regulatory proposals currently being discussed are due for adoption early in 2009.  The role and mandates of national regulators have also been the subject of in-depth consideration. Further proposals in this area will be introduced during 2009 following the report of the de Larosière Group, on prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight, early warning mechanisms and crisis management.The Government considers that the measures to recapitalise and restructure Irish banks and to reform the regulation of the banking industry as outlined above will put the Irish banking system back on a stable footing and provide it with an opportunity to supply the credit necessary to support economic development.

In order to monitor these commitments, the banks are required to make quarterly reports to the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance. The first report covering the period to end March 2009 is to be submitted by end April 2009.A Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on the 13th of February.  This code will apply to all regulated banks and building societies and will ensure that they assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner.  Where a customer gets into difficulty the lenders will give the customer reasonable time and seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice.  This is a statutory code and compliance with the code is monitored by the Financial Regulator.A Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears was also published by the Financial Regulator on the 13th of February.  Under the code where a borrower is in difficulty the bank will make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.  This is also a statutory code and compliance is also monitored by the Financial Regulator.  In addition, the two recapitalised banks will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing, where the customer continues to cooperate reasonably and honestly with the bank.

The Financial Regulator engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine the capital position of the institutions covered under the Guarantee Scheme.  This examination included an assessment of the level of impairment of assets under various stress scenarios.  A further assessment of the market values of land and development assets was carried out by  Jones Lang LaSalle to complement this work.It is clear from international experience and from our knowledge of the issues in the national context, that there is no single solution to the problems faced by financial institutions.  The provision of the Guarantee stabilised the liquidity position for the covered institutions and provided confidence to depositors in the institutions.  The recapitalisation of AIB and BOI addresses both the expectations of international markets on the Irish bank's capital levels, and strengthens the ability of the institutions to cope with impaired loans in conjunction existing reserves and retained profit from performing loans and other trading activities.I will examine various proposals, such as risk insurance, for the management and reduction of risks within financial institutions with respect to these specific exposures, having regard to international developments and to the best interest of taxpayers.  Ongoing work at the level of the European Central Bank and in the EU will inform the process.  I will be carrying forward this work to produce proposals as a matter of priority.Furthermore, in the context of the six month review of the guarantee Scheme to be completed by mid-April 2009 the Government will examine how the Scheme could be revised subject to European Commission approval and consistent with EU State aid requirements, in ways which include supporting longer-term bond issuance by the covered institutions.  This would be in line with international and EU trends where the average term of State cover for bond issues extends beyond 2010.

This rule applies equally to vehicles imported by EU and non EU persons.  In practice, Revenue allows latitude of a maximum of seven days for registration.  However, Section 135(a) of the Finance Act 1992 permitted a European or other foreign-registered vehicle which was temporarily brought into the State by a person established outside the State, to be exempted from the requirement to register for VRT purposes for a period normally not exceeding 12 months from the date upon which the vehicle concerned was brought into the State.Section 64 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 amends this section to provide for the registration (without the payment of VRT) of vehicles temporarily brought into the State for a period greater than 42 days.  When the new temporary registration system comes into effect, the vehicle owner will be required to register with Revenue and receive a temporary number plate, which will have to be displayed on the vehicle.  This will provide a mechanism whereby Revenue can maintain a record of vehicles benefiting from this exemption, quickly identify applicants who are not eligible for a temporary exemption and must immediately pay any VRT due; and identify vehicles coming to the end of a period of temporary exemption (i.e. one year), so that VRT can be collected when it becomes due.  In addition the amendment provides that vehicles seeking temporary registration will be required to undergo a pre-registration test as a pre-condition for registration.

This occurs in the context of decisions on the Estimates for Public Services for the following year.  The proceeds of the National Lottery are treated as an item of non-tax revenue and partly fund such expenditure.  Accordingly, no Department is required to bid for National Lottery funding against other Departments.

The pension related deduction applies generally across the public service, given that public servants enjoy the benefits of a public service pension which provides for greater security and more favourable terms than the generality of private sector pensions.  Due to the availability of tax relief at the marginal rate for pension contributions, in certain circumstances an individual on a higher gross income may suffer a lower net loss than an individual on a lower income as a result of the new pension related deduction.  However, it must be stated that, across the public service, total deductions (including income tax, PRSI, health levy and the new pension related deduction) will be higher as a percentage of gross pay as pay levels increase.

Any proposals for a more general property tax like all proposals for new tax or expenditure measures, will fall to be considered in the context of the ongoing development of budgetary and economic policy.

This represents an increase of €4,568 million over the Budget day forecast and in terms of financing costs for 2009 the estimate has increased by €544 million.The National Treasury Management Agency have advised me that the main reasons for the increase in the forecast cost of servicing the national debt for 2009 are the increase in the estimate for the 2009 Exchequer Borrowing Requirement and the higher interest rates currently prevailing on Government bonds.  The current elevated yields on Irish Government bonds reflects both global factors which are affecting all euro sovereign borrowers benchmarked to the German bond, and national specific factors. I understand that it is impossible to quantify the specific impact that each of these diverse individual factors have on the borrowing cost.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	744	The Exchequer Borrowing Requirement in 2008 was €12.7 billion.  The NTMA issued two new bonds in 2008 which raised a total of €11 billion.  In addition the NTMA issued net short-term debt of €18.4 billion to fund the difference and to build up end year cash balances to well over €20 billion as a prudent measure.  The NTMA also successfully issued a 5-year €6 billion bond in January of this year.  As a result, Exchequer free cash balances currently stand at over €26 billion.  The Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for 2009 as set out in the Addendum to the Stability Programme Update published on the 9th January is €18 billion.To facilitate the bank recapitalisation programme, the National Pensions Reserve Fund contribution for 2010 will be front-loaded into 2009 — this adds some  €1.4 billion to the previously announced funding requirement.  In addition a €5 billion government bond matures in April.  On this basis, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) have advised me that Ireland has a net financing need of some €24½  billion in 2009.  As is the norm the NTMA will decide on the timing of its longer term debt issuance programme for the remainder of the year in the light of market conditions.

This is part of the normal operation of the Pact whenever the General Government Deficit of a Member State exceeds or is expected to exceed the reference value of 3% of GDP.  The report relates to the deficit for 2008, as anticipated in the regular fiscal returns submitted to the Commission in October last and the estimated outturn for which was provided in the recent update.Following consideration of the Commission report by the EU's Economic and Financial Committee, the procedure normally results in the issue of a Council recommendation  with a view to supporting the Member State(s) concerned in the pursuit of measures to bring the deficit back within the reference value in a timeframe taking account of the economic background.  It is anticipated that the question of Council recommendations in the case of Ireland and of certain other Member States will be considered by Ecofin Ministers within the next couple of months.  As is normal in these circumstances, I have been in regular contact with the Commission and with my European colleagues with regard to the position of the public finances.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government adopted updated fiscal projections in January 2009 based on the end-2008 fiscal position and economic developments.  The Addendum to the Irish Stability Programme Update which was subsequently submitted to the Commission — in response to a similar invitation to all Member States — sets out the Government's fiscal consolidation plans which envisage reducing the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2013.  Given the severity and suddenness of the downturn and in order to avoid possible further damage to the economy, restoring sustainability to the public finances can only realistically be pursued over a period of up to five years.  The Commission has taken note of this.The European Commission has also noted the recent announcement regarding measures planned to improve the position of the public finances by up to € 2 billion or 1% of GDP in 2009 over and above that contained in Budget 2009.  I look forward to the support of the Commission and Council for the overall budgetary strategy of restoring stability to the public finances, while taking steps also to maximise short-term economic activity and employment and improve competitiveness.

The day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Financial Regulator, which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions.  The Financial Regulator is also obliged to treat as confidential the information it holds on regulated entities.  In relation to the specific matter raised by the Deputy, the Financial Regulator has informed me that under the provisions of Section 33AK of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act, 2003 (which deals with disclosure of information) it is unable to provide information in relation to individual firms.

As I stated in December when I first announced an approach to the recapitalisation of the credit institutions, State investment will be assessed on a case-by-case basis in an objective and non-discriminatory manner, having regard to the systemic importance of the institution, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system in the State, and the most effective and economical use of resources available to the State and each credit institution's particular requirement for capital.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	751	The importance of having a regulatory system that provides financial stability and fosters probity has become all the more clear to us now in a time of severe financial dislocation, both nationally and internationally.  A new and better co-ordinated approach to ensuring financial stability and regulation is clearly now required, with a greater degree of focus on areas such as risk management, compliance, corporate governance and general control processes.As the Deputy will appreciate, steps have already been taken in that regard in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme and, as a result of this, the oversight of the banks concerned has been greatly intensified.  This new regime provides for a heightened direct engagement with each of the covered institutions and new reporting arrangements including the provision of Scheme compliance certificates by the covered institutions themselves and by their external auditors.  The Bank Guarantee Scheme requirements and conditions are the first step in a new system of financial regulation and supervision.  The joint Boards of the Central Bank and Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority are considering further reform measures and I hope to receive their report very shortly.In addition, regulatory reviews, both domestically and at an international level, are underway including the following:The Regulatory Authority is reviewing its overall strategic regulatory approach with a view to ensuring that the Authority meets its statutory mandate and responds to EU developments in financial regulation;The Financial Regulator Business Process Review, designed to improve its effectiveness and value for money, is now close to finalisation;The Financial Regulator is also processing a strategic plan for 2009, which will address the particular EU and Guarantee Scheme requirements for 2009;At EU level, new regulatory proposals, including improvements to the Capital Requirements Directive, are due for adoption in early 2009, and more generallyAt Ecofin Council, which will incorporate the work being carried out at a wider international level, the role and mandates of national regulators are now the subject of in depth consideration and arising from this it can be expected that proposals will be forthcoming on matters such as prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight.I propose to take account of the various reviews that are underway on regulatory reform.  As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the legislative framework within which the Financial Regulator operates.  When I have considered the issues fully, I will bring my proposals for reform to Government.

It is not appropriate for me to comment in detail on specific issues without the risk of prejudicing the outcome of the investigations.  These investigations will be followed up both by the statutory authorities, which have extensive powers, and by Anglo itself.As Minister for Finance and shareholder, I will ensure where appropriate that any issues identified on foot of these investigations are properly addressed.  Furthermore, the new Board of Anglo Irish Bank is reviewing all the corporate governance practices of the bank and will put arrangements in place to guide the bank in the future.  I am confident that the new Board will pursue the necessary changes in this regard.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	753	In December 2008 the European Council adopted Commission proposals for a European Economic Recovery Plan which envisages a fiscal stimulus to the European Economy of the order of 1.5% of EU GDP.  This figure includes actions at the EU as well as at Member State level.  The plan involves a range of expenditure and revenue measures, depending on national circumstances, which are designed to stimulate recovery, maximise short-term economic activity and expedite structural reforms to improve the resilience of the economy and support jobs and growth.As the Irish economy is extremely open and globally oriented, it is strongly affected by the economic circumstances of its main trading partners.  However, it is probably too early at this stage to estimate the likely impact of the European Economic Recovery Plan.  For Ireland, the budgetary priority is to restore stability to the public finances.  In the light of the current difficult international economic environment, the Government's overall budgetary strategy aims at restoring stability to the public finances taking account of economic circumstances, while taking steps also to maximise short-term economic activity and employment, improve competitiveness and protect the position of the least well off.In line with the call for appropriate stimulus measures by national authorities, we are also maintaining a relatively high level of public investment of the order of 5% of GNP per annum to remedy a historical infrastructure deficit and to support the growth potential of the economy.  In addition, a number of specific measures –such as envisaged in the Commission Recovery Plan — have been announced and are being implemented.  These include measures to assist those who have recently become unemployed, support for the enterprise and environment sectors, such as the R& D tax credit and capital allowances for energy efficient equipment.

It recommends specific actions over set timescales which the Government has agreed to implement.  The Government will publish the first Annual Report on the State of the Public Service at the end of the year.The implementation of this transformation agenda will be driven by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  The Government has established a Cabinet Committee chaired by the Taoiseach and comprising of the Ministers for Finance, Health & Children, Education & Science, Justice, Equality & Law Reform and the Environment, Heritage & Local Government to oversee the transformation effort.  A Steering Group comprising of the relevant Secretaries General will support the work of the Cabinet Committee.  The Cabinet Committee held its first meeting on 5 February 2009 while the Steering Group has met twice.  Further meetings of both groups will take place shortly.  A Programme Office, based in the Department of the Taoiseach, is being established to support the work of the Cabinet Committee and Steering Group.

The objective of the rescue schemes was to deal with the immediate threat to financial stability that had emerged, to promote a return to normal functioning in the wholesale credit markets; and to underpin lending to the private non-financial sectors of the economy.  The introduction of the national schemes was successful in averting the immediate threat to financial stability.  However, concerns over the tightening of credit constraints on businesses and households remain.  The Ecofin meeting last December highlighted this issue, noting that "it is a matter of priority to safeguard that the measures in the common framework function properly, particularly the guarantee schemes which could help bring down the cost of financing for the financial institutions to the benefit of households and companies".In December the Commission published a paper on recapitalisation which stressed that aid should be limited to the minimum necessary and that safeguards should be taken against undue distortion of competition.  This paper noted that the objectives of recapitalisation include restoring financial stability and confidence for interbank lending, ensuring lending to the real economy and/or dealing with the systemic risk of insolvency.The role and mandates of national regulators have also been the subject of in-depth consideration at Ecofin.  Common reporting standards are being introduced to achieve greater EU-wide consistency in supervision.  Colleges of supervisors are being introduced for cross-border financial groups.  Further proposals in this area will be introduced this year following the report of the de Larosière Group, on prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight, early warning mechanisms and crisis management.In December the European Council endorsed Commission proposals for a European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) involving a fiscal stimulus equivalent to approximately 1.5% of EU GDP, as part of the Community response to the economic and financial crisis.  At last week's Ecofin meeting it was agreed that the priority is to fully restore the functioning of credit channels and that to this extent the strategy agreed in October remains fully valid.  Member States continue to remain committed to taking all necessary steps, including on capital, liquidity and lending, working together wherever possible.  The Council will continue to monitor the implementation of the rescue packages over the coming months and has invited the Commission to make recommendations on how to enhance their effectiveness.

Since January, I have met with the Chief Executives and Chairpersons of most of the covered institutions.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	757	In the Addendum to the Stability Programme Update, the unemployment rate is forecast to average 9.2% this year and 10.5% next year.  The corresponding numbers on the Live Register for this year are for an average of 340,000, reaching 400,000 by the end of the year.  In terms of next year, the number on the Live Register was forecast to average 420,000.  The end January figures, which have become available since the Addendum was published, show a seasonally-adjusted total of 326,000 people on the Live Register.  It is important to note that the Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment as it includes part-time workers (those who work up to three days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance.  Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey.Job losses have an impact on the Exchequer finances in two ways — through additional social welfare costs and reduced tax revenue.  The exact additional cost depends on individual circumstances; for example, whether the individual is married or single, whether he/she is signing on with the Department of Social and Family Affairs for full benefits or signing on due to reduced working hours, and — crucially, in terms of tax foregone — on the amount of income that they would have previously been earning.With regard to social welfare payments, it is estimated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs that each 1,000 increase in the Live Register in 2008 added €11.55 million to expenditure on Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseekers Benefit payments and in 2009 will add €11.77 million.  Receipt of secondary benefits is linked to the circumstances of individuals and as such it is very difficult to disaggregate jobseekers from other social welfare recipients in receipt of such benefits.  With regard to the loss of tax and PRSI revenue, a specific cost is not possible to compute without knowing the specifics of each individual's personal circumstance.  However, based on a number of assumptions outlined below, an overall aggregate estimate of the likely tax foregone for every 1,000 people losing employment is approximately €8 million in a full year, based on 2008 figures.The assumptions underlining this figure are:The 1,000 workers are made up of workers earning the minimum wage, the average industrial wage and twice the average industrial wage;There is a 30:55:15 distribution between those earning the minimum wage, average industrial wage and those earning twice the average industrial wage, broadly reflecting the economy wide situation; andThe breakdown by marital status also broadly follows the economy wide breakdown.No account is taken of the following:Employees' pension contributions or other salary sacrifice arrangements;Minor tax credits or income tax reliefs such as health expenses relief, rent relief, trade union subscriptions;The impact of any redundancy packages;Whether the employee takes up alternative employment in the tax year; andThe timing of the job losses within the tax year.The above factors are crucial in determining the actual cost in any one year and could reduce the cost significantly in that year.

In relation to the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, the position is that under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use.  The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.  Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate.

It would be prejudicial to the investigations for me to comment on the legality of the action of any party.  The Companies Act, 1963 is a matter for my colleague, Ms. Mary Coughlan TD, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	761	The importance of having a regulatory system that provides financial stability and fosters probity has become all the more clear to us now in a time of severe financial dislocation, both nationally and internationally.  A new and better co-ordinated approach to ensuring financial stability and regulation is clearly now required, with a greater degree of focus on areas such as risk management, compliance, corporate governance and general control processes.As the Deputy will appreciate, steps have already been taken in that regard in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme and, as a result of this, the oversight of the banks concerned has been greatly intensified.  This new regime provides for a heightened direct engagement with each of the covered institutions and new reporting arrangements including the provision of Scheme compliance certificates by the covered institutions themselves and by their external auditors.The Bank Guarantee Scheme requirements and conditions are the first step in a new system of financial regulation and supervision.  The joint Boards of the Central Bank and Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority are considering further reform measures and I hope to receive their report very shortly.  In addition, regulatory reviews, both domestically and at an international level, are underway including the following:The Regulatory Authority is reviewing its overall strategic regulatory approach with a view to ensuring that the Authority meets its statutory mandate and responds to EU developments in financial regulation;The Financial Regulator Business Process Review, designed to improve its effectiveness and value for money, is now close to finalisation;The Financial Regulator is also processing a strategic plan for 2009, which will address the particular EU and Guarantee Scheme requirements for 2009;At EU level, new regulatory proposals, including improvements to the Capital Requirements Directive, are due for adoption in early 2009, and more generallyAt Ecofin Council, which will incorporate the work being carried out at a wider international level, the role and mandates of national regulators are now the subject of in depth consideration and arising from this it can be expected that proposals will be forthcoming on matters such as prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight.I propose to take account of the various reviews that are underway on regulatory reform.  As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the legislative framework within which the Financial Regulator operates.  When I have considered the issues fully, I will bring my proposals for reform to Government.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	762	The Deputy may wish to note that the decision whether an institution operating in Ireland passes on ECB interest rate reductions to customers is primarily a commercial decision for the institution concerned.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, I have publicly indicated that I expect institutions to pass on funding cost reductions to their customers as appropriate, including in particular to those purchasing properties on variable mortgages and to small and medium-sized enterprises.  This is important to help support sustainable growth and employment in line with the objectives of the Government guarantee scheme and the Government's recapitalisation programme.My Department has been informed by the Financial Regulator that all of the covered institutions, have fully passed on each ECB interest rate cut since the bank guarantee scheme was introduced.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are also implications for the deposit rates paid by banks.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Financial Regulator to ensure that those institutions covered by the bank guarantee scheme do not pass on the costs of the bank guarantee to their customers in an unwarranted manner.  However, it must be borne in mind that credit institutions are not primarily funded from the ECB but from a variety of sources and the cost of much of their funding has been significantly above ECB rates over the last year.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	763	I would like to state from the outset that while there are undoubtedly lessons to be learned from the experience of other countries, the situation that Ireland faces today take place against the background of a global financial crisis, which has affected all the major world economies, whereas the Japanese crisis was not part of a global phenomenon.  That said, one of the lessons of the Japanese experience is the need to respond in a timely and effective manner and to establish the extent of impaired assets.  The Deputy will be aware that the level of impairment of  assets in financial institutions  has been a key consideration in the assessment of the risks and the appropriate interventions by Government  required to address and correct the particular difficulties being faced by financial institutions in Ireland.The Financial Regulator engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine the capital position of the institutions covered under the Guarantee Scheme.  This examination included an assessment of the level of impairment of assets under various stress scenarios.  A further assessment of market values of land and development assets was carried out by Jones Lang LaSalle to complement this work.  It is clear from international experience, including the Japanese experience, and from our understanding of the issues in the national context, that there is no single solution to the problems faced by financial institutions.In Ireland the Government moved quickly to provide a guarantee that stabilised the liquidity position for the covered institutions and provided confidence to depositors in the institutions.  The recapitalisation of AIB and BOI addresses both the expectations of international markets on the Irish banks' capital levels, and strengthens the ability of institutions to cope with impaired loans in conjunction existing reserves and retained profit from performing loans and other trading activities.I will continue to examine various proposals, including risk insurance, for the management and reduction of risks within financial institutions with respect to these specific exposures, having regard to international developments and to the best interest of taxpayers.  Ongoing work at the level of the European Central Bank and in the EU will inform the process.  I will be carrying forward this work to produce proposals as a matter of priority.  Furthermore, in the context of the six month review of the guarantee Scheme to be completed by mid-April 2009 the Government will examine how the Scheme could be revised subject to European Commission approval and consistent with EU State aid requirements, in ways which include supporting longer-term bond issuance by the covered institutions.  This would be in line with international and EU trends where the average term of State cover for bond issues extends beyond 2010.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I assume the Deputy when referring to ‘deposits' means the total covered liabilities guaranteed by the Government.  Under the terms of the Scheme covered liabilities include: senior unsecured debt; asset covered securities; dated subordinated debt (Lower Tier 2); along with deposits (retail, corporate, and interbank).  The estimated total amount of covered liabilities under the scheme for the final quarter of 2008 (an average of the end-month liabilities for October, November and December) amounts to €376bn. The banks are paying significant fees in respect of the Guarantee of some €450m per annum, based on the first two quarterly payments. For the institutions covered by the Government Guarantee, the deposits that are covered by the separate Deposit Protection Scheme (on deposits up to €100,000) amount to €90bn.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	765	The Irish banking system comprises multiple and varied institutions, each of which has a balance sheet with differing degrees of exposure to particular asset classes.  Any stress-test, whether by the institutions themselves or otherwise would have to take into account the type of assets on the balance sheet and the risk rating of those assets.It is a matter for each institution's own Board to decide as to the level of provisions to set aside for future write downs and to deal with that in reporting on their financial accounts.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual cases.  I should however, point out that the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, commissioned by the Financial Regulator, does not cover National Irish Bank which is not a covered institution under the Guarantee Scheme.All of the covered institutions have maintained capital ratios above the regulatory requirements of the Financial Regulator and Central Bank.   Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that the PWC report on the financial position of the six main covered institutions established that capital levels in the institutions in question would remain above regulatory minimums under various loan impairment stress-scenarios.Nonetheless, the Government has decided on a comprehensive recapitalisation package for Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks providing them with €3.5bn in core tier 1 capital each.  This package will reinforce the stability of our financial system, increase the buffer available for impaired loans and facilitate the banks in lending into the economy.  Covered institutions generally have significant reserves as well as substantial ongoing profits from their performing loans and other activities, which will act as the first buffer against impaired loans. The Government is also in discussion with other covered institutions (Irish Life & Permanent, EBS & INBS) concerning their respective positions.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	766	Measures are already in place to support those who have recently become unemployed and who may experience difficulties in meeting their mortgage payments. For example FÁS has a specific policy in place to deal with redundancies and/or company closures. It offers a tailored approach as early as possible to the workers affected with a view to assisting them to access alternative employment and/or access to relevant skills training. This applies to workers in all sectors.In terms of support for payment of mortgages, the Mortgage Interest Supplement, administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's sole place of residence. People in debt or in danger of getting into debt can also avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). This is a national, free, confidential and independent service.It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession. Home repossession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention.The finalised recapitalisation scheme announced on 11 February 2009 includes a new code of conduct for Mortgage Arrears, based on the Irish Banking Federation Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears which has been issued by the Financial Regulator and will come into force on 27 February 2009. The new Code will apply to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator.  Under the mortgage arrears code where a borrower is in difficulty the lender will make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.In addition as part of their recapitalisation scheme, the two banks concerned, A.I.B. and Bank of Ireland, will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing. This is subject to the customer continuing to co-operate with their bank.

This valuation was, in the case of direct quoted investments, based on valuations as of close of business on 30 December and, in the case of indirect investment vehicles, based on the most recently available valuations.These preliminary results also indicated that the NPRF held cash balances of €1.7 billion (10.4% of the total Fund) at that time.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	768	The primary concern of both the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator and the Government is the stability of the financial system. Clearly the markets are still very fragile and the authorities continue to monitor this situation very closely.With respect to the general regulatory framework, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme has provided for a more direct engagement with and a heightened oversight of the covered institutions.  This will be further developed as required in the light of the various reviews on regulatory reform that are now underway at national and international levels.In addition, the recent comprehensive recapitalisation of Ireland's two main banks will reinforce the stability of our financial system and increase confidence in our banks' ability to contribute to the economy.  The economic benefits of the Government's measures to stabilise the banking system will flow from an increased availability of credit in the economy.  As part of the recapitalisation measures, the recapitalised banks have committed to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator. The recapitalised banks have also agreed to fund and cooperate with an independent review of credit availability, which will be managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives.The Financial Regulator has also worked closely with my Department to introduce new codes, in particular in relation to lending to small and medium enterprise, in an effort to encourage a return to traditional banking services.The purpose of the Code on business lending is to facilitate access to credit for SMEs for sustainable and productive business propositions. The Code also aims to promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by regulated entities and to ensure that regulated entities endeavour to assist borrowers in arrears to meet their obligations or otherwise deal with the situation in an orderly and appropriate manner.  The Code will come into effect from 13 March 2009.  Firms are expected to take immediate steps towards implementing the necessary changes to systems, procedures and documents and providing relevant staff training and to have completed these changes by 13 September 2009.The Financial Regulator has also introduced a Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. This Code is designed to ensure that mortgage lenders take action to assist householders who are in arrears and will apply to all mortgage lenders, including banks, building societies and retail credit firms.Under the Code, mortgage lenders may only apply to the courts to commence enforcement of legal action for repossession of a customer's primary residence twelve months from the time arrears first arise. A lender may not seek repossession until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative repayment schedule with the borrower. The Code will come into effect on 27 February 2009.

These factors include business model changes, declining market share, rationalisation of global sites, lack of new products, consolidation due to excess capacity arising from mergers and acquisitions or cost pressures where Ireland may no longer be competitive for certain activities due to the increasing pace of globalisation and competition from low cost economies.The Irish economy is now one of the most globalised in the world. As a consequence, the uncertainty created by the current international financial crisis has had a significant impact on our economy. Our comparative advantage will increasingly lie in the production of knowledge-intensive goods and services. With that in mind, a range of policies are being pursued to enhance competitiveness and improve the business environment for both manufacturing and services.Maintaining the competitiveness of the enterprise sector in Ireland is a priority issue for my Department and our development agencies. In order to sustain and grow the manufacturing sector, Irish based manufacturing enterprises will be encouraged and assisted to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.The "Report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing", launched in 2008, identified the focused actions needed by employers, employees and Government to respond to challenges and take advantage of opportunities to further develop the sector in Ireland. The report sets out a number of recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development for the innovative firm, and increasing awareness and take up of existing supports. The Social Partners agreed, as part of the review of "Towards 2016", that a Manufacturing Forum should be established, in line with the recommendations of the High Level Group on Manufacturing. This matter is currently being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Social Partners.We continue to be one of the world's leading service exporting countries. Over the next ten years, services will be one of the key drivers of Ireland's economic success and job creation. The report of the Services Strategy Group, "Catching the Wave:  A Services Strategy for Ireland", sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland's services sector and outlines how to maximise the future returns to the country from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential. Implementation of the recommendations of the Services Strategy Group — some of which are already being acted on by the Enterprise Agencies — will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others.I am determined to maintain and improve our focus on developing indigenous industry, where we are working consistently and successfully to build Irish exports in world markets. The newly established €60m Growth Fund is designed to assist Enterprise Ireland's small to medium sized clients achieve greater competitiveness by improving their export potential.  This will be achieved by increasing gross output and productivity whilst also maintaining existing employment levels in clients throughout all counties. I recently launched Enterprise Ireland's strategy for the internationalisation of Ireland's services sector, which the agency estimates could yield up to €1.14bn in new export sales for Ireland by 2010, and a doubling of exports sales in this sector to €5.25bn by 2015. I also announced Enterprise Ireland's "Going Global Fund" — a €3m government fund specifically aimed at locally traded companies that have successfully established businesses in Ireland and wish to explore opportunities to sell abroad.The government is committed to ensuring that we continue to create an environment for enterprise that remains among the most favourable in the world and which will position us for long term economic growth through the adoption of this series of proactive policies and strategies that best serve the interests of the manufacturing and services sectors.

These are essential powers for any inspectorate to allow meaningful enquiry.I am informed that NERA Inspectors undertake both "announced" and "unannounced" inspections.In the case of ‘announced inspections', I understand that it is the practice for an Inspector to contact the employer by letter or telephone to advise the employer that it is intended to carry out an employment rights compliance inspection on their business and to make the necessary arrangements for undertaking the inspection.   To assist employers in making sure that the appropriate records required to demonstrate compliance are available, the employer will be notified of the proposed time and date for the inspection together with a list of the records to be made available on the day.I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there are circumstances where advance notice could compromise or undermine the effectiveness of employment law enforcement, such as in relation to inspecting for compliance with the Protection of Young Persons Act.  In the case of unannounced inspections, the Inspector presents at the place of business and seeks the production of appropriate records.Detailed procedures and policies are in place governing the conduct of inspections undertaken by NERA in relation to employment rights compliance and NERA operates to an internal Code of Practice in this regard.  NERA has also produced a very useful "Guide to Inspections" which is published on NERA's website and can be accessed at www.employmentrights.ie under "Publications."Additionally, Inspectors are subject to the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour.  Inspectors are required to behave in a courteous manner and treat all persons fairly, lawfully, and with respect.NERA officers also work within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's Customer Service Charter in terms of customer service standards. Service standards are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis to reflect customer and stakeholder feedback and experiences. A NERA specific Customer Service Charter will be drawn up and implemented in line with the enactment of the Employment Law Compliance Bill, which will place the Authority on a statutory footing.

The gross interest derived from a general deposit account is treated as reckonable income for the purposes of self-employed PRSI and the health contribution.The most recent tax return received by the Revenue Commissioners from the person in question was for tax year 2007.  The DIRT deducted at source from the deposit interest income has been allowed for by way of a tax credit on the notice of assessment that has issued to the person in question for 2007.  The net effect of this is that the interest has not been taxed twice.The person concerned has been allowed all tax credits appropriate to her 2007 tax return, based on the information supplied.

The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax on the profits of the new trade and on the gains from disposal of assets used for the purpose of the new trade to nil. Full relief is available where the corporation tax otherwise payable by the company in respect of any of its first 3 years is €40,000 or less. There is marginal relief where the corporation tax liability is between €40,000 and €60,000.The intention is that this relief will comply with the EU de minimis Aid Regulations.  These Regulations set the level of de minimis aid available, generally, at €200,000 over any three year period. In the case of the road transport sector, the figure is €100,000.  Any tax relief under the provisions of section 31 of Finance (No 2) Act 2008 will affect the amount of further State aid that a company can receive.  The requirement that the company be newly registered ensures that we are starting at the beginning as regards State aids.  In addition, with the new company requirement, the new trade will be easily distinguishable from other businesses run by a promoter and/or other related companies which is important so as to ensure against any abuse of the measure.For these reasons, I had to choose a date to define a ‘new company' under the legislation and incorporation from the date of Budget 2009 is a reasonable approach. If the date was changed to facilitate some, it would still likely impact on someone else.  While there may be some additional cost and inconvenience for a small number of individuals or companies, this has to weighed up against the significant benefits being provided under this incentive.  I do not propose to amend this requirement of the legislation.

Given the sharp decline in car sales internationally and in the State, while it is difficult to estimate, a significant reduction in VRT yield is expected in 2009.A revised VRT system was introduced with effect from 1 July 2008. The aim of the revised VRT system was to rebalance VRT so that consumers would be rewarded for choosing lower CO2 emission vehicles. I have no plans to change the VRT system at this time.I am conscious of the difficulties being experienced by the motor industry. The condition of the industry is the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry.

Under the Directive VAT is not chargeable on second hand vehicles acquired by an individual in Ireland from another member State. This is to avoid double imposition of VAT in the EU on the same vehicle. However, second hand cars coming from outside the EU are subject to VAT under customs valuation rules. VRT is applied to both new vehicles and second hand imports being registered in the State.I have no plans to introduce a scheme whereby a person bringing their vehicle out of the State on a permanent basis or selling a vehicle outside the State will obtain a refund of VRT.

However, I understand that the Irish Banking Federation has been considering the issue of Sharia compliant mortgages and I look forward to the outcome of their examination of this issue in due course.The Deputy may wish to note that there are various types of Sharia compliant mortgages including the Ijara mortgage referred to in the Deputy's question. An Ijara mortgage involves a lease to buy arrangement. A Musharaka mortgage is a similar arrangement but includes shared ownership of the property throughout the life of the loan. Murabaha mortgages, on the other hand, basically involve the property being purchased by the financial institution and sold on at a profit to the consumer in lieu of interest.

The unit has responsibility for the ongoing prudential supervision of the covered institutions as well as addressing the responsibilities of the Financial Regulator under the Scheme.There are currently 26 people working in this Unit. 17 personnel have been assigned from the Financial Regulator to this unit, 11 of whom were already involved in the prudential supervision of the covered institutions.  The Financial Regulator has recruited a further 9 individuals to the Bank Guarantee Unit on a contract basis. These contract staff have specialist banking skills, particularly in the areas of lending and liquidity management.The Financial Regulator advises me that it is currently completing recruitment procedures to retain a further 6 contract staff and that the recruitment process for the remaining 5 of the 20 contract staff is progressing well.The contract personnel who have been retained have been selected through an extensive process of interview and review from a population of close to 700 applicants for such positions, as advertised by the Financial Regulator in November 2008. The recruitment was staggered to ensure that an immediate priority was first given to appointing Senior Advisors for the oversight team with the recruitment of support staff to follow.  A second set of interviews has concluded and a third is now underway. The remaining places on the oversight team will be filled in the coming weeks.Among the candidates already selected are senior experts in Credit Risk and Credit approval, Treasury, Investment Management, Equity and Liquidity Risk Management and Property Valuation.

Sums paid in respect of travel and subsistence allowances will not be subject to the deduction. The deduction will be made from gross pay before income tax, PRSI and health levies are calculated. Thus, pension contributions will be effectively relieved of tax at the marginal rate.It is intended that the pension deduction will apply to employees in bodies where a public service pension scheme exists or may be made.  This includes those who started work in the public service post 1995 and whose pensions are calculated using an integration formula effective from 1 January 2004.  This system delivers increased pensions to members of public service pension schemes whose full-time salary is less than 3 1/3 times the Contributory State Pension.With regard to public service employees working in a body where there is or may be a pension scheme, if the employees are not entitled to be members of that scheme, for whatever reason, then it is intended that those employees will not be subject to the deduction.  Deductions will be repaid to those who leave the public service with no preserved pension benefit, i.e. with fewer than two years service.

In such circumstances, a reduction in tax credits is automatically created in order to collect the tax that has/should have been withheld by the tenant. This meets the tenant's liability in relation to the tax withheld.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	795	I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 153 together.Deputy McGrath has provided details of an individual but he will appreciate that I cannot comment on any particular case.    However, with regard to public service employees working in a body where there is or may be a pension scheme, if the employees are not entitled to be members of that scheme, for whatever reason, then it is intended that those employees will not be subject to the deduction.The pension related deduction will be deducted from gross pay by employers before income tax, PRSI and health levies are calculated. Thus, pension contributions will be effectively relieved of tax at the marginal rate. The net reduction of income for the vast majority of public servants will be less than the gross calculated on the basis of the 3 deduction rates and the relevant income bands.  An individual's  pension contribution or their net income will be subject to many variables, including marital status, dependent children, statutory deductions, etc.The approach to the pension related deduction is that it applies generally given the fact that all public servants enjoy the benefits of a public service pension which provides for greater security and more favourable terms than the generality of private sector pensions.  The graduated approach to the payment is to ameliorate somewhat the impact on lower paid public servants.

In this regard, the Revenue Commissioners cannot comment on the Valuation Date or the actual liability in this case, as no papers, including the Inheritance Tax return, in relation to her inheritance, have as yet been submitted the taxpayer.The taxpayer should contact Capital Taxes Section, Limerick Tax District, River House, Charlotte Quay, Limerick for any further assistance in this case.

It is now in the private sector and employees are employees of eircom.  The current terms and conditions of employment of all its employees is a matter between eircom as a private company and the employees and the staff unions concerned.The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 made provision for the transfer of staff from the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs to Telecom Eireann. The staff transferred became employees of the company on vesting day. The legislation provided that, until such time as they were varied by the company, following consultation with recognised trade unions and staff associations,  the terms and conditions of the staff transferring would be no less favourable than those that applied immediately before vesting day.Similar provisions in respect of pension arrangements were provided for the transferred staff in that provision was made for no less favourable conditions in respect of persons who, immediately before the vesting day, were members of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs than those to which they were entitled immediately before vesting day.

This includes as a priority the elimination of the current budget deficit and bringing the General Government deficit to below 3 per cent of GDP by 2013. The indicative annual adjustments needed to meet this are set out in the Addendum to the Stability Programme Update published in early January.Capital investment relative to national income remains high, which in the short-run will stimulate the economy and will over the longer-term enhance the productive capacity of the economy and ensure future improvements in living standards.In addition, the Government's package of measures for the Irish banking system, including significant steps to maintain the stability of the financial system and those taken under the recently announced recapitalisation initiative, will serve to stimulate credit supply and consequently economic recovery.The Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal launched by the Taoiseach last December sets out our agenda over the next few years for how we will re-orientate and reprioritise the business of Government to achieve the goal of building a Smart Economy, which will help underpin our future.The policies now being pursued are being implemented against a backdrop of economic uncertainty both at home and abroad. The absolute priorities are maintaining stability in our financial system as it is vital to a fully functioning economy and society, the restoration of order to the public finances and improving competitiveness.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	800	The Government's Guarantee Scheme comprehensively sets out measures under which the commercial conduct of covered institutions is to be governed.Section 36 of the Scheme regulates the balance sheet growth of covered institutions to ensure that it is not excessive.  This function will be monitored by the Financial Regulator, who has recently confirmed to my Department that all the covered institutions are operating within the defined parameters as at 31 December 2008.  The monitoring function has been aided through the allocation of additional staff to the banking supervision side of the Regulator.Section 37 requires a covered institution to "conduct its affairs in a manner that progressively reduces the risk to the Exchequer under its guarantee" having regard for several criteria in particular, as directed by the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, after consultation with me.Furthermore, section 39 of the Scheme requires a covered institution to limit its exposure to any sector, customer or connected customers where the Financial Regulator, after consultation with the Minister, considers it to be in the public interest, and in the interest of financial stability and confidence in the banking system.It is also important to note that section 47 of the Scheme requires bonuses and other benefits deriving from performance to be "measurably linked to reductions in guarantee charges, reduction in excessive risk taking and encouraging the long term sustainability of the covered institution".However, I would like to remind the Deputy that the objective of the Guarantee Scheme and the recapitalisation initiative was not to prevent banks from lending but to ensure that they continued to lend to individuals and SMEs, which is crucial for growth in the economy.  In that regard, the recapitalised banks have committed to increase lending capacity to SMEs by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	801	I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 149 together.The economy's competitive position has deteriorated in recent times. This deterioration has been driven by a combination of factors including a strong euro, wage increases in excess of productivity and a relatively high inflation rate.As the Deputy is aware, national competitiveness is a shared responsibility of all in society. Regaining our competitive position — which as a small open economy is critical to our economic success — will require each of us to play our part and work towards this end.For its part, the Government has put in place a budgetary strategy to restore stability to the public finances. This strategy involves a number of measures including reducing and prioritising current expenditure and in this regard, the introduction of a public sector pension levy is a central element. While it is difficult to quantify the precise effects of such measures on national competitiveness, I am confident that Government action to stabilise the public finances will have a positive impact in terms of restoring wider confidence in the Irish economy, thus boosting our attractiveness as a location for inward investment. In addition, to the extent that the public sector pension levy will serve to promote wage adjustment in the private sector via a demonstration effect, there will be a knock-on effect for competitiveness.I would also point out that by undertaking the necessary adjustments now, the Government will avoid having to take more injurious action in the future. In this way, Government action is supporting the long-term competitiveness of the economy.More generally, the Government has, and will continue, to support competitiveness.  To this end, the Government is committed to maintaining a pro-enterprise environment, and has implemented policies aimed at improving competition in product markets and flexibility in the labour market. For example, in Budget 2009, I re-affirmed the Government's commitment to the 12½ per cent rate of Corporation Tax. The subsequent Finance Act contained a number of very significant changes to the R&D tax credit scheme aimed at encouraging further R&D activity here. In addition, the Government is continuing to prioritise productivity enhancing investment under the National Development Plan.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	802	I would like to reassure the Deputy that my Department monitors inflation developments on an ongoing basis. As measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), annual inflation in Ireland was 1.1% in January 2009. Using the domestic measure — the Consumer Price Index (CPI) — the annual inflation rate was -0.1%. Factoring in the latest ECB rate cut, along with more recent data since the publication of my Department's forecasts in early January 2009, would imply an average CPI inflation rate of around -2.0 per cent in 2009. Taking account of the latest data would imply a broadly flat rate of HICP inflation in 2009.This current and prospective easing in inflation will be of benefit in terms of the domestic cost base, thus improving national competitiveness and our attractiveness as a location for inward investment. While this is to be welcomed, it must be remembered that the deterioration in the economy's competitive position in recent times has been driven by a combination of factors, not just a relatively high inflation rate. Other relevant factors include wage increases in excess of productivity and a strong euro.Of these, exchange rates are outside our control. However, wages are clearly within it. Restoring Ireland's attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment will also require sensible developments in this regard as we move forward. In addition, we must continue to take steps to improve productivity. The prioritisation of productivity enhancing investment under the National Development Plan will play its part in this regard.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	803	In light of the unprecedented pace of developments in the global and domestic economic environment since the October Budget, the economic and fiscal forecasts were revised and new macro-economic and fiscal forecasts were published.Consequently, in early January, revised aggregate tax forecasts for 2009 and the following years to 2013 were set out by my Department in the Addendum to Ireland's Stability Programme Update, which was submitted to the European Commission on 9 January last. My Department now expects that tax revenue for 2009 will decline by 9¼%.Monthly profiles of projected tax receipts are normally published by the end of January every year. However, this year, reflecting the fact that the tax forecasts were revised at the start of January, the publication of tax revenue profiles has been delayed. I expect my Department to publish these tax profiles shortly.The end-January Exchequer Returns showed tax receipts, at €3,735 million, which were generally in line with expectations. In this regard, tax receipts for January 2009 represent approximately 10% of the forecast receipts for the year and this is in line with the percentage received in previous years. While tax receipts were down 19% year-on-year, it must be taken into account that tax receipts in January 2008 were relatively strong.

This code applies only to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal residence in the State, by all regulated entities operating in the State.I understand that the Free Legal Advice Centre referred their concerns to the Financial Regulator.The Financial Regulator's Code regulates the conduct of mortgage lenders but does not alter contractual arrangements between lender and borrower.

The group was then required to enter into a post-approval process so that they could proceed to signing a contract with Pobal which would allow for the draw-down of the approved funding.  The group was not in a position to proceed to contract within the required timeframe and consequently a decision has been made to decommit the funding.  The group has been advised of the outcome and also of their right to appeal the decision.

Under the previous child care support scheme, applicants were assessed for funding on the basis of the levels of service provision and disadvantage which they reported.  Services were required to tier their fees according to parental circumstances, however, any change in the profile of parents using a service was not reflected in the level of grant aid provided and grant levels were set for periods of up to 3 years.A significant improvement under the CCSS, is that funding is adjusted on an annual basis and takes account of changes in parental profiles as well as any changes to the level of service provided.  In addition, services may apply during the year for a review of their funding, allowing for an even more rapid response to be made.  Details regarding the 2009 review date are currently being finalised by officials in my Office and are expected to be advised shortly to services participating in the CCSS.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	810	The Mental Health Commission report, ‘The Economics of Mental Health Care in Ireland' endorses the recommendations in  ‘A Vision for Change'. ‘A Vision for Change', which has been adopted as Government policy for the future development of mental health services acknowledges that the costs associated with mental health issues are far-reaching, impacting on the quality of life of individuals and their families, employment and productivity and on the economy in general.  This Government is firmly committed to the implementation of ‘A Vision for Change' so that individuals can achieve and maintain optimum mental health for the benefit, both social and economic, of society as a whole.Substantial resources are invested in mental health services. Overall spending on mental health services in 2007 amounted to €1 billion, and this level of funding continued into 2008 and 2009.  Implementing ‘A Vision for Change' is essentially about the reallocation and remodelling of these resources.The estimated additional cost of the implementation of ‘A Vision for Change' is €150m over 7 — 10 years.  Development funding totalling €51.2m was allocated to the HSE in 2006 and 2007, some of which was diverted because of core budgetary pressures. However, I am advised by the HSE that 94% of the €51.2m will be in place before the end of 2009.  Additional funding has been provided in 2009 for the recruitment of 35 therapy posts for the child and adolescent mental health service.  Once-off funding of €1.75m has also been provided in 2009 for suicide prevention initiatives and for mental health projects supporting service users and carers.Following the publication of the Oireachtas sub-committee's Report on the Adverse Side Effects of Pharmaceuticals in April 2007, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) initiated a process to examine the various items raised. This process involved the appointment of independent external consultants and experts in the field of pharmacovigilance and drug safety who conducted a robust assessment of the proposals which was completed in late 2007.The outcomes of this assessment were communicated to my Department and proposals made concerning conduct of clinical trials and post authorisation studies are already provided for in legislation and are the subject of a range of initiatives. One such initiative underway at European level is an EMEA (European Medicines Agency) project to establish a European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP) to look at ways of establishing studies in the various member states and enhancing the sharing of study data across the EU. The IMB's intensive involvement with the EMEA and European medicines regulation ensures our full engagement with this initiative and access to all resultant patient safety information.Regarding the handling of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) reporting, a number of items highlighted in the Oireachtas sub-committee's report reflected submissions made by the IMB and the consultant's assessment drew attention to the following opportunities which are currently being progressed by the IMB: further development of stakeholder education strategy to include safety issues across the organisation, expanding the current IMB adverse reaction education and awareness programme to a wider health care professional base, members of the public and to enhance the profile of the topic in the media, targeted campaign focussed on improving awareness of adverse reaction reporting among health professionals and the public,the publication of high level adverse reaction data.The sub-Committee's report referred to the need to increase the reporting of ADRs.  Following on from this, the IMB has developed a website which has the capacity to take on-line reporting of adverse reaction reports.  This system became operational in 2008 and reports are being taken from both health care professionals and patients.  The website can be accessed at; http://www.imb.ie/EN/Safety--Quality/Online-Forms/Human-Medicine-Adverse-Drug-Reaction.aspx.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	812	There are no plans to publish specific national guidelines on identifying and responding to the needs of child victims of sexual exploitation. This issue is addressed throughout Children First — the National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children which was published in September 1999, and recently reviewed.  These guidelines are national over-arching guidelines that apply to all individuals and agencies that are dealing with children.  They are intended to support and guide health professionals, teachers, and members of the Garda Síochána and the many people in sporting, cultural, community and voluntary organisations who come into regular contact with children.  The objectives of the National Guidelines are: to improve the identification, reporting, assessment, treatment and management of child abuse; to facilitate effective child protection work by emphasising the importance of family support services and the need for clarity of responsibility between various professional disciplines; to maximise the capacity of staff and organisations to protect children effectively; to consolidate inter-agency co-operation based on clarity of responsibility, co-ordination of information, and partnership arrangements between disciplines and agencies; to clarify and promote mutual understanding among statutory and voluntary organisations about the contributions of different disciplines and professions to child protection.The key message of the Children First Guidelines is that responsibility for protecting children must be shared by all adults.  Anyone who works with, has responsibility for, or comes into contact with, children should be aware of the signs of abuse, be alert to the possibility of abuse, and be familiar with the basic procedures to report their concerns. While the Children First Guidelines are not statutory, they still bring with them very clear responsibilities for those who become aware of child protection issues, of which sexual exploitation is one aspect. The consistent application of the Children First Guidelines is being addressed by the HSE through ongoing standardisation of Child Welfare and Protection business processes (this project is expected to be completed in 2009) and the refocusing of social work services through the ongoing Social Work Reform programme. "Sexual exploitation" of a child, as defined in the Children First Guidelines, includes inciting, encouraging, propositioning, requiring or permitting a child to solicit for, or to engage in, prostitution or other sexual acts. Sexual exploitation also occurs when a child is involved in the exhibition, modelling or posing for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification or sexual act, including its recording (on film, video tape or other media) or the manipulation, for those purposes, of the image by computer or other means. It may also include showing sexually explicit material to children which is often a feature of the "grooming" process by perpetrators of abuse. Sexual exploitation can involve situations of sexual victimisation where the person who is responsible for the exploitation may not have direct sexual contact with the child. Two types of this abuse are child pornography and child prostitution.All child abuse reports to social work departments are subject to a phased process of initial screening and assessment, aimed at providing appropriate interventions.  In addition, there are legislative mechanisms in place which also allow for responses from Gardaí (for example to take a child to safety in emergency situations relating to welfare and protection).The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008 was enacted in June, 2008. The Act criminalises trafficking in children and adults for the purposes of sexual and labour exploitation or the removal of their organs.  It also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale or to purchase or offer to purchase any person for any purpose. Penalties of up to life imprisonment apply in respect of these offences. In addition to the Criminal Law provisions, an Interdepartmental High Level Group has been established by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to recommend the most appropriate and effective responses to trafficking in human beings to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The HSE and OMCYA are represented on this group. One of the five interdisciplinary groups established by the High Level Group is looking at sexual exploitation issues.The Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in February 2008 to ensure that the State's response to trafficking in human beings is coordinated, comprehensive and holistic. A key element of this strategy will be the development of a National Action Plan to Prevent and Tackle Trafficking in Human Beings to be approved by the High Level Group for submission to the Minister.  This Action Plan will assist the Government in curbing human trafficking and ensure that victims are helped and treated accordingly.The issue of separated children seeking asylum going missing from care has given rise to concern. A new national protocol regarding all children who go missing from care has been drafted by the HSE and An Garda Síochána and I understand that it is awaiting final sign off by both organisations. Separated children are dealt with specifically in this protocol. The HSE work closely with the Garda Missing Persons Bureau on this matter.Legislative provisions covering the issue of sexual exploitation of children include Section 176 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which deals with sanctions for those not reporting child abuse i.e reckless endangerment of children. Under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Act 2007, it is an offence to meet a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation following grooming. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is also considering measures to make grooming an offence. Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1992. The Convention is in essence a "bill of rights" for all children. It contains rights relating to every aspect of children's lives including the right to survival, development, protection and participation. Articles 34 and 35 refer respectively to the protection of children from sexual exploitation and from sale, trafficking and abduction.A Senior Officials group, comprising the OMCYA, the HSE, An Garda Síochána, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science was established in 2008, with a focus to ensure that there is full awareness of child protection policies, guidelines and procedures, to consider how to ensure better knowledge of the Children First Guidelines, better training and education about the Guidelines, to consider processes and protocols for information exchange to ensure full adherence to the Guidelines, and to advise myself accordingly.

However, in practice, arrangements have been made in several regions to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of any arrangements for community chiropody services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  I understand that priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.

Under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries which have also ratified the Hague Convention, and countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement which meets Hague standards.While it is true to say that our current Agreement with Vietnam is based on Hague principles, as part of the preparations for our new legislation we need to ensure that our Agreement reflects the Hague Convention as comprehensively as possible. A new Agreement allows the opportunity to elaborate and strengthen some existing provisions to meet the standards which it is anticipated will be set in draft legislation. There have been considerable developments in intercountry adoption in Vietnam since the Agreement was signed 5 years ago. This progress also needs to be reflected in any new Agreement.In December 2008, the Irish Government issued a formal request to the Vietnamese Authorities stating that we wish to enter into discussions immediately for the purpose of negotiating a new Agreement to follow on from the existing Agreement which will expire on 1 May 2009. The Vietnamese Authorities have responded positively to Ireland's request.Ireland offered to provide the Vietnamese Authorities with the text of a draft agreement as a basis for negotiations. An initial draft was prepared by my officials and was submitted to colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office for their consideration in December 2008.At present, the text of the draft is being finalised following the receipt of legal advices. Once the text of the draft has been agreed between the OMCYA, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office it will be forwarded to the Vietnamese Authorities for their consideration. It is anticipated that we will be in a position to forward this draft to Vietnam very shortly.The work to prepare for and advise the Government on this issue and the implementation of Government's decisions is being given the highest priority.  These are complex matters which require careful consideration. At all times, the Minister and the Government, and officials advising them, are guided by the need to respect and protect the best interests and rights of the child.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	819	As you may be aware, further to the Taoiseach's announcement in May 2008, arrangements to transfer responsibility for the Young People's Facilities & Services Fund (YPFSF) to the Office of the Minister for Children & Youth Affairs have recently been completed.Since it was established in 1998, the Government has allocated over €150m under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF) to assist in the development of youth facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  Approximately €66m has been provided for capital developments, which include the building, upgrading, fit-out and refurbishment of some 220 youth and community facilities in the different target areas.Over €20m, in capital and current funding has transferred from the Department of Community, Rural, & Gaeltacht Affairs Vote to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA). I am confident that the transfer will assist in ensuring the most strategic use of this Fund and other youth programmes under my overall remit. I can assure the Deputy that my officials are liaising with the existing National Assessment Committee to ensure the focus and objectives of the Fund are protected and promoted in the OMCYA. In 2009, current funding of the order of €17m is provided to support the employment of approximately 408 youth and outreach workers, centre managers, sports development officers and administration staff.Overall, I believe that the Fund has had a very positive impact on communities since it commenced nearly 10 years ago. Over the years, the areas covered under the Fund had been marked by a serious dearth of facilities and services and many of the clubs and community groups in those areas had traditionally not been able to access funding from other mainstream schemes to the same extent as other more affluent areas.I am confident that the integration of this Fund into the OMCYA will continue to provide a cohesive and comprehensive response to the needs of all young people, including those at risk of drug use.

However, as the existing legislative framework for the regulation of the travel trade has been in existence since 1982, in May last year I asked the Commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the travel trade legislation. The purpose of the review was to assess the operation of the current regulatory arrangements and to recommend any reforms that may be warranted.Following an extensive consultation process, the Commissioner submitted its report to me on 30 December 2008 which I have published on my Department's website www.transport.ie.On 11 February 2009 I met with representatives of the Irish Travel Agents Association who outlined their proposals for the reform of travel trade regulation.I am currently examining the findings and recommendations of the Commission's report and I will also consult with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on the report's findings in the context of consumer protection policy generally.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	830	The Government's opposition to extraordinary rendition and to the use of intensive interrogation techniques such as water-boarding, which are internationally considered to constitute torture, and its support for the early closure of the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, have been made clear on many occasions. This position was communicated by our Embassy in Washington to the incoming US administration during the transition period following last November's election. Since the inauguration of President Obama it has been re-confirmed to the US Embassy here. The issues involved were most recently discussed at a meeting between officials of my Department and of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a senior State Department representative in Dublin on 9 February.On 22 January, President Obama signed three Executive Orders and one Presidential Memorandum in relation to the detention policy of the US and related matters. I have warmly welcomed his decision to close the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay within a year. I also welcome provisions in the Executive Order entitled ‘Ensuring Lawful Interrogations' which relate to the prohibition of interrogation methods incompatible with the Geneva Conventions, to the expeditious closure of CIA facilities, and to the need to ensure access to all prisoners by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Taken together, these measures represent an important step towards meeting our concerns regarding Guantánamo.The President has also established a Special Task Force which as part of its remit will ‘study and evaluate the practices of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic law , international obligations and policies of the United States and do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control'.While we would prefer to see a clear renunciation of the practice of rendition in any circumstances, the Special Task Force's terms of reference include some clearly very positive elements. We will continue to follow developments, including the eventual findings of the Special Task Force, carefully and will convey any further views to the Administration as necessary.

The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.The regulations set out the rules as to which State's social security system a person will pay contributions to when s/he moves from one Member State to another to take up work, or where s/he lives in one State and works in another. The Regulations also set out the rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the usual contingencies arising, e.g. unemployment, sickness, old-age etc.The general rule is that a person is insured in the State in which they are employed. The State of last employment is also generally responsible for paying benefits when, for example, a person becomes unemployed. The Regulations also provide that when entitlement to benefit is being examined account must be taken of insurance paid in any other Member State where the person worked.In general, an Irish national who has worked in, say, the UK and meets the qualifying conditions for jobseeker's benefit in that country, who then wishes to return to Ireland to seek work, may export and continue to receive that benefit from the UK for up to three months in accordance with EU legislation.That person would not be entitled to Irish social security benefits, such as jobseeker's benefit, until they become subject to the Irish social security system by re-entering insurable employment here and paying PRSI contributions. In the event of any subsequent period of unemployment they may become entitled to jobseeker's benefit on the basis of their Irish contributions, and any reckonable contributions made under the social insurance system of any other EU Member State. Those who do not qualify for social insurance payments here can apply to have their eligibility for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance assessed.As a Member State of the European Union, we are bound to apply the regulations governing social security rights of people living and working in the EU, in accordance with the objective of the EC Treaty of the free movement of persons.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	844	I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 196 together.With the increase in the number of people applying for unemployment payments in particular, staff in social welfare offices have been working extremely hard to process claims as quickly as possible.Productivity has increased significantly. Nearly 155,000 claims were processed in Local Offices in the last quarter of 2008 (including the One Family Payment). This compares with less than 89,000 in the last quarter of 2007, representing an increase of 74%.I know that processing times in some areas are still too long and I assure Deputies that we are doing our best to reduce them. I appreciate that becoming unemployed is a very difficult time in a person's life and that they need to get access to financial and other supports as quickly as possible.The overall performance in any individual office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors, including increased inflow of claims, staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office.The Department has put a range of measures in place to deal with the extra workload arising from the increase in the Live Register. These include:  —  additional posts assigned from other parts of the Department —  use of temporary staff to fill vacancies  —  extension of temporary staff contracts in certain offices  —  increased overtime  —  prioritisation of work.The average time for applications processed in January was 2.47 weeks for jobseeker's benefit claims and 5.92 weeks for jobseeker's allowance claims.

It provides a comprehensive review of existing scientific evidence drawing on World Health Organisation (WHO) and other expert studies. It answers many of the questions raised by the public in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields.  Its findings have been accepted by Government.The Report confirms the majority scientific opinion that to date no adverse short or long term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection.  However, a minority group of scientists believe otherwise and extensive international research continues to be coordinated through bodies such as the WHO.  This research is co-funded by the Irish Government.The Department's current advice to those living in close proximity to mobile phone base stations, based on the findings of the Expert Group Report, is that there is no scientific basis for, or evidence of, adverse health effects in children or adults as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields.  This applies irrespective of the location of the phone mast.All telecommunications operators in Ireland are required to adhere to internationally established limits for limiting exposure of the public to electromagnetic emissions from their masts by the terms of their licences from the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).The internationally established emission limits for non-ionising radiation are set by the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), a body of independent scientists who have expertise in researching the possible adverse health effects of exposure to non-ionising radiation.  ICNIRP has published a set of guidelines on limiting human exposure to electromagnetic fields.  These guidelines are freely available from their website.Over the last number of years, ComReg has conducted measurement surveys to verify compliance with these limits by its licensees.  The detailed measurement results from 600 sites have been published on their website.  All measurements have so far shown total compliance with the ICNIRP limits.Following the publication of the Expert Group Report, the Government decided that the statutory powers of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) will be extended to include responsibility for matters relating to the health effects of electromagnetic fields.  The details of implementation of the new function for the RPII will be presented to Government for approval in due course.  Until the transfer of function to the RPII takes place, my Department will continue to hold responsibility for these matters.

Any moneys borrowed, and any interest accruing thereon, may be secured on the revenue, funds or property of the Authority.The Authority has made a significant investment in the acquisition of the Irish Glass Bottle (IGB) site in Poolbeg.  I understand the Authority considers it likely that the value of the IGB site is some 20% to 30% lower than when it was purchased, and that there will be a professional valuation of the site within the next few weeks.The IGB site remains an important development asset and, in due course, the Authority's interest in this property will facilitate it in achieving its long-term objectives for the sustainable regeneration and development of the Poolbeg area.

For the 34 County and City Councils, a sliding scale with four separate spending limits, based on the population within each individual electoral area, will apply.  A top limit of €15,000 will apply in the most populated electoral areas, with a population of 32,501 persons or over.  A limit of €13,000 will apply in the county and city council electoral areas where the population is between 22,501 and 32,500 persons.  A limit of €11,500 will apply to county and city council electoral areas with a population of between 12,001 and 22,500 persons.  The lowest limit of €9,750 will apply to county and city council electoral areas with a population of 12,000 persons, or less. Given their different administrative responsibilities, a standard spending limit will apply to all 80 of the Borough and Town Councils.  Candidates standing for election to these local authorities will be subject to a spending limit of €7,500 in all cases.The spending limits for local elections will apply to individual candidates in the first instance.  Candidates nominated by a political party will be deemed to automatically allocate 10% of their limit for use by the party's National Agent.  However, there will be scope to vary this figure upwards or downwards by written agreement between the candidate and the party.It is intended that spending by candidates and political parties on the election campaign in the 60 days leading up to polling day will be covered under the new scheme of spending limits.While there were previously no limits on local election expenditure, under the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999, all local election candidates were required to submit a declaration of campaign expenditure, and the source of the funds to meet that expenditure.  I propose to build upon these provisions.  It is envisaged that candidates will continue to submit spending returns as they have done heretofore, but will be required to comply with the new spending limits.

The Programme entails a three pronged approach to addressing the legacy of older housing with poor energy efficiency standards.The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme is the largest element of the Programme with a budget of €50 million in 2009.  This scheme has the potential to support the upgrade of in excess of 27,500 homes in 2009.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) estimates that demand for this scheme could ultimately exceed 100,000 homes.Homeowners can expect to save up to €700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, with the minimum grant level set at €500.  Homeowners can apply for grant aid on more than one house.  A list of eligible measures and fixed grant rates is set out in the following table:MeasureFixed grant rate€Roof Insulation250Cavity Wall Insulation400Internal Wall Insulation2,500External Wall Insulation4,000High Efficiency Boiler with Heating Controls Upgrade700Heating Controls Upgrade Only500Building Energy Rating Assessment200The HES Scheme has been launched now in order to allow installers who wish to participate in the scheme, to register with SEI.  Registered contractors will be required to sign up to a code of conduct and comply with a range of terms and conditions to ensure the quality of work carried out under the scheme.  They will also have to carry a specified level of insurance and be fully tax compliant.  SEI will be implementing a quality assurance and inspection programme to ensure compliance with these requirements.  Contractors wishing to register with the scheme may contact SEI at 1850 927000 or at hescontractor@sei.ie.The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners and landlords will be able to apply under the scheme from next month.  In the meantime, homeowners can register their interest with SEI on 1850 927000 or at hes@sei.ie.  Homeowners may arrange to have a building energy rating carried out immediately, if they wish, but this is not a requirement for participation in the scheme.  However, homeowners should not take any action on the other measures until they have received grant approval from SEI.Following completion of any work carried out under the scheme, the homeowner and contractor must sign a "declaration of work completed", which must then be furnished to SEI in order to receive payment of the grant.The second element of the National Insulation Programme for Economic Recovery, the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), is designed to assist private households on low incomes, such as those in receipt of Fuel Allowance, Invalidity or Disability Benefit.  The scheme provides for the installation of a range of energy efficiency measures, including cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, a boiler lagging jacket, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  The WHS provides these measures free or at a nominal cost to the householder.I have made available some €20 million to the WHS in 2009.  This greatly increased level of funding is expected to support energy efficiency interventions in up to 15,000 low income homes in this year alone.  The scheme is now open for applications and there are 20 community based organisations (CBOs) currently delivering the WHS, and this represents just over two-thirds of the country.  Under our initiative to extend the scheme nationwide in 2009, SEI plans to commence the introduction of new CBOs to the scheme from the end of March 2009.A number of improvements to the WHS are gradually being introduced this quarter, including a new free-phone service designed to assist eligible homeowners in identifying their nearest provider.  If outside of current coverage, their details will be recorded and notified as soon as the service becomes available in their area.  In addition, a new website will be launched to allow homeowners, neighbours or relatives find out more information about the WHS and other grant schemes available in their area.Further information on the WHS is available by calling 1800-250204, by emailing warmerhomes@sei.ie or at www.sei.ie/Grants/Warmer_Homes_Scheme.The third element of the National Insulation Programme for Economic Recovery will involve providing similar energy efficiency upgrade measures in social housing.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be making further announcements on this element of the programme in due course. The National Insulation Programme has the potential to contribute to the creation of 4,000 direct and indirect jobs thus contributing to the Government's priority objective of maintaining and creating employment as part of economic renewal.

Phase III was launched in July 2008 and continues to support the installation of a variety of technologies in existing homes.Any support scheme such as Greener Homes must evolve over time to a point where the industry is self sufficient and this overall approach has been reflected in the adjustments made to this scheme at appropriate junctures to date.  The scheme has stimulated the development of a new sector, improving the supply chain for the products, services and fuels.  The application of product standards, installer training and the quality framework has ensured that consumers are both informed and confident in their choices.The Building Regulations, which came into force on July 1st 2008, make the inclusion of renewable energy regulations in new homes mandatory.  It is therefore no longer appropriate to grant aid installation of renewable technologies in new homes, with consequent impact on the budgetary requirement for the scheme.  Also, the Building Regulations mandatory requirement will of itself significantly stimulate demand for renewable energy products and services.  The installation of renewable heating systems in existing homes, which is typically more complex and more expensive, warrants continued support in the short to medium term while the market reaches maturity.The scheme is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and further information, including how to apply for a grant is available on its website at www.sei.ie.

Additionally, the service will have a contention ratio of 36:1, a latency of 120 milliseconds and a 15 gigabit (12 down, 3 up) inclusive monthly allowance limit.Under the terms of the contract, the NBS broadband products will be upgraded to higher specifications (speeds, contention and data caps) in July 2010 and October 2012 without any increase in the monthly recurring charge.In recognition of the fact that some areas will be very difficult to reach using standard infrastructure, 3 will make available a satellite product, which is expected to cover around 5% of the NBS areas.  The satellite product will have a minimum download speed of 1Mbps, a minimum upload speed of 128kbps, a maximum contention ratio of 48:1, latency of 800 milliseconds and an 11 gigabit (10 down, 1 up) inclusive monthly allowance limit.I am satisfied that the NBS will provide speeds comparable with products available in the market for urban areas and greatly assist in bridging the digital divide.

While recognising that some premises within substantially served areas may have difficulties for a variety of reasons in receiving a broadband service, the National Broadband Scheme cannot cater for such limited instances as to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	871	An application under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 12 May 2008. Following initial validation of the application, two of the land parcels declared were identified as having also been claimed by another scheme applicant. In keeping with standard practice both parties were written to and requested to submit evidence of their right to claim the parcels in question. A reply was received from the person named on 16 October 2008 stating that he did not have the right to claim for the land. As a result of these discrepancies the claimed area of 45.33 hectares was reduced to 40.03 hectares, which was insufficient to support the number of entitlements held (45 SPS entitlements).In this situation, the EU regulations required the area eligible for payment to be reduced by 9.94 hectares. Therefore, the area on which payment was made was 30.09 hectares and full payment on the reduced area has issued.

As the poultry sector was not one of the sectors in receipt of direct aid under the SPS, it was not included in the list of sectors (in Article 68.1(b) of Regulation 73/2009) identified as eligible for the unspent SPS fund.The primary outlet for Irish-produced poultry is the fresh retail trade. In that market the main challenge facing the indigenous Irish poultry industry is competition from imports of fresh poultry from other EU countries. Under single market rules unrestricted volumes can be traded between Member States and they are very competitively priced.  The Bord Bia Poultry Quality Assurance Scheme quality mark is of great assistance to the indigenous poultry producer in the area of retail sales and the Bord has been very active in nurturing the Scheme over the years.The Poultry Expert Group will reconvene shortly to review its recommendations in the light of developments over the last year and consider what further issues warrant consideration. The Group's 2007 report focused on a range of issues including labelling, environmental protection, welfare legislation and feeding stuffs.The outlook for the EU poultry industry is quite favourable with modest growth likely over the coming years. The challenge will be for Irish producers to remain sufficiently competitive to retain current market share.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	878	Against the background of the deterioration in public finances, my approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agrifood sector.   In protecting expenditure in certain areas, expenditure in other areas had to be curtailed.  In relation to the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme, I have made provision of over €9 million to meet current commitments but it has been necessary to close the Scheme to new applications.  The use of the modulation funds is currently under consideration within my Department.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The pigmeat recall scheme provides assistance in respect of eligible product manufactured from pigs slaughtered in Ireland between 1 September and 6 December 2008. The scheme includes the conditions to be met regarding the storage, transportation and destination of eligible product.A case has been made for other products manufactured in Ireland and that were affected by the product recall to be considered for assistance. These would include products containing both Irish and imported pigmeat and products made here using solely imported pigmeat that, at the time of the recall, could not be segregated satisfactorily to facilitate its sale. My Department is currently considering the position of such products.  My Department is in discussion with the industry about possible improved traceability. This will undoubtedly be a key issue for the Group that I have set up under the Chairmanship of Professor Patrick Wall to examine all aspects of the dioxin issue.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	882	The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.   The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health Ministers during 2009.   Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling my Department has taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific legislation since September 2000.Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.   In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them. In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling. However the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted the negative opinion in December 2008.We will continue to pursue this issue at EU in the context of the current review. I would point out that products carrying the Bord Bia quality assurance label provide consumers with assurance on product origin.

The Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative is part of a framework introduced to secure improved value for money from public expenditure. The objectives of the review are to analyse Exchequer spending in a systematic manner and to provide a basis on which more informed policy decisions can be made. It is one of a range of modernisation initiatives aimed at moving public sector management away from the traditional focus on inputs to concentrate on the achievement of outcomes. To support the overall process, the review will include engagement with parent representatives, schools, education partners and other representative groups.There was no predetermined budgetary cost for this review as cost is dependent on many elements such as the location of the schools to be reviewed, the number of visits per school and the number of meetings which will be required to complete the review and write up the report.  The review is being carried out by officials within my Department as well as officials from the Department of Finance and the National Council for Special Education.A Quality Analyst has been engaged to support the process as stipulated in Department of Finance guidelines in carrying out such reviews. This person has been engaged on a fixed-price basis of €4,185 excluding VAT. My Department is in the process of recruiting an external researcher to the review and discussions are ongoing in relation to a number of issues for this contract.  It is expected that the review will be completed by the end of 2009.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	898	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 252, 255 and 258 together.I wish to advise the deputies that all primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD).  All primary schools were given these additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model of learning support/resource teaching introduced in 2005. Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.The Deputies will be aware that allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however allows for a small reduction in this number and permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class.  In the schools in question, the number of pupils dropped below this minimum. These schools therefore are no longer entitled to the teaching posts in these classes.In 2005 when the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation.  The number of these special classes has decreased over the years and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.  The number of teachers involved in MGLD classes in County Galway is 4 and the number of pupils is 22.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	900	I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the parent's fears, as outlined in his letter, are unfounded.  I note from the parent's letter that the pupil was not attending a special class and was mainstreamed with access to the school's learning support/resource teacher and that the pupil thrived with this level of support.  Pupils, such as the pupil in question, will continue to receive additional teaching support in schools through the General Allocation Model of resource teaching which is available to all primary schools. There has been no change in this policy.  These resources are available to schools in addition to the school's allocation of classroom teachers, based on a school's overall pupil enrolment.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	901	The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.The staffing schedule for the 2009/2010 school year, Primary Circular 0002/2009, has been published on my Department's website at www.education.ie and my officials have written to all schools to notify them in this regard. The number of mainstream class teachers appropriate to a school for 2009/10 school year is determined by reference to the school’s valid enrolment on 30 September, 2008. The schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.The staffing schedule also makes provision for schools that are projecting significantly increased enrolments for September 2009 through the allocation of what are known as "developing posts". These classroom teaching posts are allocated to schools based on projected enrolments for September 2009 rather than on past enrolments for September 2008 which is the case for most schools.  This allocation process for developing posts takes places during the Spring and Summer period when schools apply to the Department based on their projected enrolments for September 2009. The developing posts are allocated on a provisional basis initially and are confirmed following receipt from the school of actual enrolments in September 2009.The staffing allocation to schools will also be impacted by any changes in the levels of support teachers such as for language support, special needs and social inclusion. The allocation process for some of these posts is currently underway. Language support posts are allocated during the Spring/Summer period on a provisional basis initially and are confirmed following receipt from the schools in September 2009 of actual enrolments of pupils requiring language support.The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to create a staffing profile for the individual school as requested by the Deputy could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.   I have already put it on record that I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally what the final impact is on the overall changes in aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year. I will set out the final position when the allocation processes have been completed.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.In light of the Budget 2009 decision a new circular will be issued to schools in the Spring setting out how the new arrangements will operate for the allocation of language support teachers. The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007. However, there will be some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. Language support posts are allocated during the Spring/Summer period on a provisional basis initially and are confirmed following receipt from the schools in September 2009 of actual enrolments of pupils requiring language support.We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teaching posts in our schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts.  By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.

A "regulatory body" is defined as one that has functions in at least two of the following three areas of activities:The formulation of goals; the making of rules and/or the setting of standards.Monitoring; gathering information; scrutiny; inspection; audit and evaluation.Enforcement; modifying behaviour; applying rewards and sanctions.Staffing levels and approximate 2008 budget allocation figures are included for the Deputy's information. The 2008 outturn figures are not readily available. Additional material requested by the Deputy will be provided as soon as possible.1. Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC)
FETAC gives people the opportunity to gain recognition for learning in education or training centres, in the work place and in the community. FETAC's functions include: making and promoting awards, validating programmes, monitoring and ensuring the quality of programmes and determining standards. FETAC has a staff complement of 53 and its 2008 budget was approximately €7 million.2. Higher Education Authority (HEA)
The HEA is the statutory planning and development body for higher education and research in Ireland.  The HEA has wide advisory powers throughout the whole of the third-level education sector.  In addition it is the funding authority for the universities and a number of designated higher education institutions. The Institute of Technology Act 2006 provided for the designation of the Institutes of Technology as institutions of higher education under the HEA.  Upon commencement of the Act on 1st February 2007, the HEA took over the role of funding authority for the Institutes of Technology.  The principal functions of the HEA are to further the development of higher education; to maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education; to assist in the coordination of state investment in higher education and to prepare proposals for such investment; to allocate among universities and designated institutions the grants voted by the Oireachtas; to promote the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education and democratisation of higher education.  The HEA has a staff complement of 72.5 and its 2008 administrative budget was approximately €6 million. The HEA administers funding for the Universities and Institutes of Technology and the provision for this purpose in 2008 was approximately €1.54 billion.3. Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC)
HETAC was established by the Government in 2001, under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999. HETAC is the qualifications awarding body for third-level educational and training institutions outside the university sector and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It is the successor to the National Council for Educational Awards (NCEA).  HETAC may delegate authority to make awards to Recognised Institutions under the Act. Recognised Institutions currently comprise the Institutes of Technology.  HETAC awards qualifications at all levels of higher education and training up to PhD level. HETAC's main functions include: setting standards for higher education and training awards; validation of higher education and training programmes; monitoring of institutional quality assurance procedures; delegation of awarding powers to recognised institutions; ensuring that student assessment procedures are fair and consistent; ensuring that arrangements are in place in commercial education and training institutions to protect learners where programmes validated by HETAC cease to be provided. HETAC has a staff complement of 34 and its 2008 budget was approximately €4.6 million.4. National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB)
The NEWB is the national agency with responsibility for encouraging and supporting regular school attendance. This body has functions in the area of enforcement/taking legal action and also has monitoring and inspection functions as regards school attendance patterns. The NEWB has a staff complement of 104 (this includes 84 Educational Welfare Officers) and its 2008 budget was approximately €10.1 million.5. National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI)
The NQAI has three principal objectives, which are set out in the Qualifications (Education & Training) Act 1999: (a) the establishment and maintenance of a framework of qualifications for the development, recognition and award of qualifications based on standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by learners; (b) the establishment and promotion of the maintenance and improvement of the standards of awards of the further and higher education and training sector, other than in the existing universities; and (c) the promotion and facilitation of access, transfer and progression throughout the span of education and training provision. The NQAI has a staff complement of 25 and its 2008 budget was approximately €3.2 million.6. State Examinations Commission (SEC)
The SEC is responsible for the operation of all aspects of the established Leaving Certificate, Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Leaving Certificate Applied and Junior Certificate Examinations. The individual functions involved in the operation of the examinations include: preparing examination papers and other examination materials; determining procedures for the conduct and supervision of examinations; recruiting contract staff to draft and mark examination components and to superintend at the examinations; arranging for marking of work presented for assessment and examinations; issuing the results of examinations; determining procedures to enable the review and appeal of results of examinations at the request of candidates; charging and collecting fees for examinations; designating places where examinations may be held. The SEC has a staff complement of 176 and its 2008 budget was approximately €66.2 million.7. The Teaching Council
The Council establishes, publishes, reviews and maintains codes of professional conduct for teachers: these include standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence; establishes and maintains a register of teachers; and will, when the appropriate section of the Teaching Council Act, 2001, is commenced, conduct inquiries into and, where appropriate, impose sanctions in relation to fitness to teach, of any registered teacher. The Council has a staff complement of 40.5 (including 12 temporary) and its 2008 budget was approximately €4.8 million. The Teaching Council has operated as a self funding body since March 2008.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	904	The decision to approve job-sharing and career-break applications is a matter for the authorities of the employing school.  In the case of schools that have over-quota teachers, vacancies do not arise as a result of teachers approved for job-sharing or career break. This position is no different from that pertaining in previous years.In these schools that have over-quota teachers, applications for job-sharing and a career break may be considered by the authorities of the schools concerned in the normal way. Because the school is over its allocation of teachers my department will not give automatic replacements. It is, of course, open to the school authority to apply to my Department for additional teaching hours by way of curricular concessions to cover part or all of the hours in respect of an approved job-sharer/career break teacher. Each such application is considered on its merits.
