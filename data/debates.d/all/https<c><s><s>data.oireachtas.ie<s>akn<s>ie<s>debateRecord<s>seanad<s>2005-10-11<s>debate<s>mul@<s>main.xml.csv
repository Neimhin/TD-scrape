I have selected those raised by Senators McHugh, Dooley and Feighan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Browne, Bannon and Morrissey may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.

On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in Seanad Éireann, I extend a very warm welcome to the delegation and sincere good wishes for a very successful and enjoyable visit.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 5.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the debate; and No. 2, statements on the Clare Street initiative and traffic calming measures, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 7.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	3	We agree to the Order of Business. Over the weekend, we yet again saw the appalling tragedy of the waste of eight young people's lives on our roads. These were young people who had everything to hope for and their families and communities are shattered as a result of their deaths on our roads. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport to come to the House to give us a full audit of the national road safety strategy. This strategy has been in place since 1998 and while there was a reduction in the number of road fatalities and injuries following the introduction of penalty points, unfortunately, we have gone in the other direction since then. More people died this year on our roads than last year. This is a crucial issue that we must address on an all-party consensus basis to ensure measures are taken to improve safety on our roads. Despite the Government's commitment to introduce a Garda traffic corps, only 33 garda officers have been deployed for this purpose. I understand that ten speed cameras are currently working despite the fact that the Government said that speed cameras were in place around the country. We need to beef up considerably current deterrents and safety measures to ensure this ongoing tragedy is stopped quickly. I ask the Leader whether such a debate could be organised very shortly.The Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries, Deputy Gallagher, attempted to fillet our good friend and colleague, Senator Dardis, on yesterday's "Morning Ireland". The Minister of State did so because Senator Dardis had the courage to look for reform in the entire area of drift net policy and salmon resources.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	4	There is plenty of reform going on over here.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	5	We all agree that the depletion of salmon resources in Ireland must be addressed.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I understand that a joint committee, on an all-party basis, welcomed the kind of measures Senator Dardis had the courage to outline last week. Can we ask the Minister for State with responsibility in this area, who seems to have more of an eye on his own constituency than on the country's affairs, to come to the House to give us the actual Government position? We must take a position on this issue within the next month so that we can ensure this marvellous resource is kept in this country. Drift netting is a relatively recent phenomenon, having commenced only 25 years ago. Where one of our colleagues, even one from the other side who is causing the Government considerable blushes, has the courage to stand up, he needs our support. I request a debate on this matter.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	8	As a native of a small fishing village, I have a great deal of sympathy for the points made by Senator Brian Hayes and I congratulate Senator Dardis on the extraordinarily good work he does in the area in question. The Independent Senators have a motion on the Order Paper which deals with that issue but it might be more ecumenical and Catholic of us——
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	9	That is a contradiction in terms.

We could adopt an all-party approach to this matter. I ask the Leader to consider holding a discussion on Senator Dardis's policy paper on fishing with a view to the Seanad supporting it and taking a vote on that basis.

This is a matter about which the Government does not need to be told about our business. We can go ahead and do it. This is within the House and we should carry out our business and make the Government respect us.We should send a vote of thanks to the OECD for announcing yesterday that while life expectancy might increase to 150 years within the foreseeable future, we will not be asked to work for 150 years. It is extremely good of the OECD to highlight this fact. However, its proposal that people should work until age 80——
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The proposal is that they should work until age 85.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	16	As a contributor on this issue for many years, I have always been unhappy with the outcome of debates. However, I wish to request another debate. The difficulty with debates at OECD and European level is that the approach taken is broad brush or blunderbuss. In other words, if we have a problem here we should shoot over there. There is no finesse or attempt to get matters right. During the past ten years I have continually stated that the period between full-time work and full-time retirement should be extended and should include measures such as flexi-time, half-time, part-time and working for half the time and receiving half a pension. These proposals have worked well in other jurisdictions and I ask that they be adopted here.The parliamentarians from Canada who are visiting us today have a view on this and put two extremely good ideas to me. The Government of Canada is inclined to select, propose and appoint Independent Members to the Canadian Senate and its Senators are appointed for life. Even though they are appointed for life, they are required to retire at 75 years of age. Perhaps this issue could be examined with the others.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	It is probably a commentary on the length of time that Senator O'Toole and I have been here that I was going to raise this delightful idea from our Canadian colleagues regarding people being Senators for life until they reach the age of 75. Perhaps the OECD would try to persuade them to continue until they reach 85 years of age.Senator Brian Hayes raised the issue of the horrible accidents in County Donegal. I have raised this issue on many occasions and have tried to do something about the fact that virtually no heavy goods vehicles on our main roads observe the legal speed limit. Those vehicles are supposed to have speed governors fitted. When I come across these vehicles on the road, I record their details and write to the companies involved. Every one of them writes back with a hand-on-heart assurance that speed governors are fitted to their vehicles. All of these trucks cruise along at 60 mph even though their speed governors are supposed to ensure that they cannot travel at more than 55 mph. The hand-on-heart assurances I receive inform me that there is no problem but it is usually stated in the final paragraph that it is possible the driver removed the fuse from the governor, thereby bypassing it. What is the point of having a technological device meant to regulate the speed of a heavy goods vehicle if it can be bypassed by simply removing a fuse? Either it is there or it is not. I will not allow companies to put the blame on their employees. It is up to the companies to ensure their vehicles operate in compliance with the law. The excessive speed of heavy goods vehicles on our inadequate roads is a contributory factor to accidents. The statistics show they represent 3% of all registered vehicles which are involved in 10% of fatal accidents. That has nothing to do with the awful tragedy in Donegal but it is one of the contributors to the slaughter on our roads.I wish to ask the Leader about two issues I previously raised; one was in regard to aeroplanes landing here that apparently do not have to provide manifests of who or what is on board, and how that is reconcilable with our law and with international obligations; and the second matter related to the absence of country of origin labelling on products coming from some of the most nefarious and obnoxious countries in the world, including Burma in particular. The Leader was to find out about those matters and I am sure she is endeavouring to do so but I just want to remind her.A long and serious debate in this House on health is overdue. Over the weekend the Tánaiste and the chief executive of the Health Service Executive announced that 3,000 new acute beds were no longer on the agenda because we did not need them. It was decided after years that we did not need them because, apparently, other countries survive with fewer. This morning we discovered there is something close to chaos in the ambulance service in Dublin. The Tánaiste has not taken any decision on a report which she has had for six months, which should have been implemented by now, to try to sort out the fact that there are two parallel ambulance services. On occasion, two ambulances have arrived at the same incident because they do not communicate very well.The Competition Authority is involved in a daft exercise to try to get away from a fixed level of consultants' fees, as if sick people would go shopping around for the cheapest consultant when they desperately need the best. We are getting involved in a succession of issues such as the partial privatisation of hospitals and other such matters. Last week many health board employees received a letter telling them of the wonderful computer system they had, which was very good at organising their salaries and what they could do if they had a problem. The health service is in a state of complete chaos. Nobody is responsible. Nobody is taking decisions. Adequate time must be provided for a major debate on the state of the health service.

It would be useful to discuss road safety and related aspects in the Seanad at a later stage.In a feeble attempt to ingratiate myself with the Cathaoirleach, regarding Senator O'Toole's remarks on the Canadian procedures, he should have added that the Cathaoirleach should be returned without opposition to the next Seanad——

I am sure the Cathaoirleach would agree with that.The report produced this morning by the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the future of our salmon stocks reflected a great deal of hard work and a genuine attempt by the members of the committee to come to grips with the matter. It is a report that should be dealt with in the House. I am reminded of the phrase about damning with faint praise.

We should debate the report. I was struck by something said by the Chairman of the committee, Deputy O'Flynn, this morning. He made the point that the survival of the species was too important an issue for the Irish people, with which I fully agree. There is no disagreement about that. He said it is a very complex issue, with which I also agree. That is why we might well debate it. However, there are aspects of the report with which I do not agree and I would be happy to debate those in greater detail on the floor of the House at a later stage. Deputy O'Flynn also said he did not want the argument to descend into a squabble about who gets to kill the salmon. I differ with him on that; the squabble is about who gets to save them.

Much work was done on the report by the sub-committee. I agree with most of the findings, which were based on consensus. Like Senator Dardis, I, too, would have placed a ban on drift net fishing. If the enthusiasm exists at Government level to respond to the recommendations in the report, my proposal is achievable. After all, it is not so long ago since there was a blockade at Rosslare Port by the scallop fishermen. We all know what emerged within four weeks. Under the chairmanship of Padraig Flynn, a report was produced——

Some €45 million was allocated towards decommissioning part of the fleet. In that context, it is surely possible to allocate a sum of money to achieve this objective. On the basis of the advice that exists, it will cost much less than €45 million. I hope the Government will commit itself to responding to the report.

There are some 285,000 people in receipt of such allowances, but costs have spiralled. The cost of 1,000 litres of oil is now €660, a bag of coal costs €6.50 and a bale of briquettes costs €2.85. The allowance amounts to approximately €9 per week. Revenue is accruing from oil and petrol sales and this should be redistributed, not to us but to those who need it most. This would be the quickest way to gain support. This will be the winter of discontent unless something is done for the elderly, who need the fuel allowance more than anybody else. How could one of us live on a fuel allowance of €9 per week if spending——

There were two areas in which it happened. Superintendents are now working both in Belfast and Dublin in plain clothes. We should recognise this as a very worthy step, particularly in light of a point made in the House some time ago but which we have not heard recently, namely, that penalty points issued in Northern Ireland do not apply in the rest of the United Kingdom and that penalty points issued in the Republic do not apply in Northern Ireland. The Minister should be able to tell us the degree of co-operation between the two traffic corps. We brought this matter to his attention a year ago and he said he would look into it, but we have not heard from him since. It seems so logical and sensible that there should be an all-Ireland penalty points system if we are to curb, in some form or another, the horrific deaths that are occurring on the roads.

Young person after young person is being killed on our roads week in, week out, and no points system or camera on any road will solve it. We may, as Senator Ryan stated, be obliged to examine the possibility of introducing draconian measures such as speed governors on cars operated by people under a certain age or those who may not have undergone the appropriate training.

I refer here to the oakwoods in the area of Derrycunihy. Traces of this disease have been found at Torc and on Ross Island. Hopefully, that is as far as it will spread.

We all take particular pride in the achievements of recent years. Economists have pronounced this to be the best country in the world in which to live. Our success was achieved with the help of friends in North America and the UK who, through the years, invested in this country and helped it develop. In later years, it was helped greatly through our own efforts. Many Irish people have gone as far west as Vancouver and to the east as far as Vladivostok to do business and we are proud of that. The Government has a very proud record in reducing poverty in this country. However, there is always a need to refocus efforts and I request the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue.

I am sure our distinguished friends from Canada will sympathise with us,. I recall what happened some years ago when the great cod banks were being fished out and when the Canadian trawlermen stood up powerfully against the Spanish invaders. Much of that initiative was held to be illegal. I was one of the few here who said that while it might be illegal, they were perfectly right. We have the same situation here because we have drifted. Governments have drifted and allowed this to happen. Senator Ross and I have tabled a motion in support of our colleagues. We have pursued this matter during the past five or six years. The motion in our names is very detailed and does not limit itself just to the issue of driftnets. However, I warmly salute the work done by Senator Dardis. The PDs have played a very important role politically. During the week, one their Members in the Lower House indicated that she would vote against the Government on this issue. That type of pressure had a salutary effect.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I am also seeking a debate on the rolling scandal involving computer technology in various Departments. I was speaking at a dinner last night. One of our really excellent entrepreneurs and businessmen who operates in this area discussed the matter with me. I was left wondering why we did not have a trade mission to this country to sell our own computer expertise. Why do we go to big foreign conglomerates? We have a reputation for being at the front end of research and design in this area, along with numerous other small countries. Why do we not source this type of material here? They would be far less likely to make a bags of it. Big companies, on the other hand, are responsible for damage to a major pharmaceutical concern in the US. They have done the same to the British health service. Then they come to us. A local company, however, would be afraid to move from an estimate of €9 million to one of €400 million. Will the Leader request from the various Departments figures on how much of our information technology is domestically generated?Senators will take the next issue I raise to their hearts. I listened to people discuss the Residential Institutions Redress Board on radio this morning. It is important the Leader arrange for a debate to take place once the board has reported because many people believe its remit should have been extended. Despite a Government commitment to pay the legal expenses of all those involved, solicitors are taking €15,000 or €20,000 from compensation payments before they are passed on to people who have already been damaged by the institutions of the State. This is a scandal. The House should review the issue when the Residential Institutions Redress Board concludes its work.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I support the call for a debate on road safety, an area on which we must step up action. I was shocked to learn recently that a small device available for sale in the United States and, I am sure, elsewhere can detect speed checks from a distance of three miles. This apparatus needs to be outlawed and the practice condemned. I ask that the Minister for Transport come before the House to inform Senators whether the use of such devices is a criminal offence and, if so, what penalties are available for those caught in their possession. This equipment, which is being used by the young and not so young, will have a serious impact on efforts to overcome our road safety problems. The hatchet needs to be taken to the issue.Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to debate the conditions under which some doctors and nurses must work in accident and emergency departments at weekends? Some accident and emergency units resemble war zones. Doctors and nurses are employed to provide a professional service, not to act as security personnel or mediate in rows. It is shameful to learn what happens in accident and emergency departments, which require additional security, particularly at weekends.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I endorse the comments made on salmon drift netting, although the conversion has been belated on the part of many. Nevertheless, I am delighted it has taken place because drift netting is a vital issue. The Independent Group has raised it for many years but our concerns have fallen on deaf ears. I join Senators in congratulating Senator Dardis and hope he will join a picket on salmon drift netting at the Fianna Fáil Party Ard-Fheis next week.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Over the past two and half to three years we have been promised an extension of the medical card system. The most recent one, for which we have been waiting two and a half years, is the extension of the doctor-only medical card. It is shameful in the extreme. I ask the Leader to request the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to exempt people who have been diagnosed as being terminally ill from a means test for a medical card as a matter of urgency. It is shameful that spouses and family members must go through the application process, be means tested and be told that their means exceed the limit and then, only at the discretion of the appeals officers, be granted the medical card. I ask the Leader to immediately ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to use her discretion in exempting people who have been classified as terminally ill, especially those suffering from cancer, from a means test.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I agree with the previous speakers who spoke of the tragedy in County Donegal at the weekend. The tragedy has caused a sense of numbness in the Inishowen Peninsula. Five young people from Inishowen and one young person from Derry have lost their lives. Inishowen is a close knit community and this has sent shockwaves through the peninsula, but the families and the community in general affected by road death in Donegal feel something must be done. I am in agreement with Senator MacSharry in terms of calling for a debate in this House. Such a debate would be appropriate and timely.Geographically, Inishowen is inextricably linked to Derry, which is the fourth largest city in Ireland. When Garda resources are deployed to Inishowen account is not taken of the fact that Derry is a neighbouring city. Inishowen receives a great deal of car traffic from Derry and we do not have Garda resources. Our sympathies are with the families who have lost loved ones.

#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I support Senator Coghlan's point about the danger to the oak forests, especially in Killarney National Park, because that dreaded disease is already in the rhododendrons. I support his call that we keep a close watch on that and get some indication from the Minister on how it can be dealt with.I would welcome a report on the decline of salmon stocks. It would be useful to debate that matter and I support the call for such a debate. It would be naive to believe that the mere banning of drift netting will halt the decline of salmon stocks. That would be a foolish assumption to make because there are other issues that need to be tackled as well, and it is important that we debate them.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I ask the Leader to try to arrange a further debate on decentralisation. The budget, in five or six weeks time, will mark the second anniversary of the Government's announcement of decentralisation to 50 or 60 towns across the country. Unfortunately, the debate has moved from doubt to ridicule. The problem is people do not believe that the decentralisation project is going ahead.It is important that we get the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Parlon, to the House to explain and debate the direction the decentralisation programme is taking. We are all mature enough to accept that what was originally promised will not be delivered. We have a hub and national spatial strategy. If we put all our strategies together, we could ensure that decentralisation is practised as well as preached. It is ridiculous that two years after its announcement no progress has been made. We need a debate on the issue now.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of the number of road deaths over the past weekend and wants a full audit of the national road safety strategy. We were all shocked at the loss of so much potential in such a short period. We will seek a full debate on road safety and strategy. The Senator also raised the matter of salmon policy and the reform sought by Senator Dardis. He wants the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with responsibility for fisheries, Deputy Gallagher, to come to the House to discuss the policy. We would be delighted to arrange that.Senator O'Toole welcomed Senator Dardis's statement. He also welcomed the OECD report. He would like to be appointed for life, as would we all.Senator Ryan spoke about the Donegal accidents and the lack of governors in large trucks, which seem constantly to travel over the speed limit. It seems foolish that the governors can be disabled by removing a fuse. He also raised the matter of airline manifests. I intend to put forward an Adjournment matter, which will hopefully be taken on Thursday, which will seek this information, because I cannot seem to get it otherwise. The Senator also commented on the reported chaos in the ambulance system in Dublin.Senator Dardis welcomed the joint committee report on salmon stocks and agrees it is a complex area. Senator Finucane is a member of the committee and agrees on the need for debate. Senator Leyden wants a debate on the inadequacy of the free fuel allowance for the elderly in the light of the current price of fuel. I admire his humanitarian nature.Senator Quinn talked about swapping of personnel between the Garda and the PSNI. He suggested swapping knowledge and strategies and the establishment of an all-Ireland penalty points strategy to improve road safety. Senator MacSharry wants a debate on the committee report on salmon drift netting and angling, of which committee he was a member. He also seeks a debate on road safety strategies.Senator Coghlan is concerned about the threat to oak trees in Killarney National Park by the aggressive plant disease known as sudden oak death. Senator Hanafin wants a debate on poverty prior to the budget.Senator Norris agrees with the call for a debate on the salmon strategy. I did not quite get what he had to say about computer technology because somebody was laughing. I agree with him that it is a scandal that solicitors are taking up to €20,000 from compensation payments made by the Residential Institutions Redress Board to people damaged by State institutions. I heard a solicitor say on the radio yesterday that any such solicitor would be struck off the roll.

He also mentioned a device that can discern the presence of a speed check from a distance of three miles. I did not know of this device, but it should not be allowed. Senator Bannon also called on the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to address the issues in accident and emergency units. The Senator reported that doctors and nurses have to face war zones.Senator Ross spoke about salmon drift netting, which is the subject of a motion in the names of the Independent Members. The Senator said that he would like to come to Killarney. I extend an invitation to him to come to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in Killarney.

We should go somewhere else this time.Senator Ross also spoke about the sessional orders. As the Cathaoirleach said, the matter was on the agenda at the first meeting of the new session. I appreciate that people may not always be in a position to attend such meetings. The Senator said that "ordinary Senators" like him should be given more speaking time. I would never call Senator Ross ordinary — it would be more appropriate to call him extraordinary, in the nicest way.Senator Ulick Burke called for the extension of the medical card system to people who are terminally ill. In my experience, if one contacts a person in an office, he or she will deal with one's case sympathetically. While Senator Burke is aware of that, he thinks people will terminal conditions should be given medical cards automatically, without having to make such contact.Senator McHugh is from the area in which last Friday night's accident took place. I can imagine how he feels about it. As he said, Inishowen is near Derry. The Senator called for increased measures in this area. I am not sure about how effective they would be. I heard someone on the radio yesterday saying that if a garda could be deployed in every bush in Ireland, it would still not be enough to stop the awful road deaths from taking place. Such accidents constitute a waste of human potential.Senator Daly supported Senator Coghlan and called for a debate on this country's salmon stocks. I will try to ensure that such a debate takes place next week.Senator Bradford asked for a debate on decentralisation. He alleged that the decentralisation programme has gone from doubt to ridicule. He mentioned that the national spatial strategy has been published since the initial announcement about decentralisation was made. I will endeavour to arrange a debate on the matter.

Jim Kolbe and Rep. Jeff Flake.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I welcome this opportunity to address Seanad Éireann on this important motion, having already addressed the Dáil on the matter last week.The vulnerable situation of the undocumented Irish in the United States is well known to all Members of the Oireachtas. As public representatives, the very stressful burden placed on such individuals, and the restrictions within which they must operate, have unfortunately become very familiar. The prevailing security climate in the US adds considerably to their difficulties. Tighter border security measures, being unable to travel home for fear of being refused re-entry and difficulties in obtaining driving licences all serve to increase the pressure on these people and marginalise them further. It is no surprise, therefore, that, together with their families here at home, they are increasingly feeling the strain. This debate provides us with an important opportunity to support the undocumented Irish and to highlight our shared concern, on an all-party basis, for their welfare. It also allows us to warmly welcome the high priority which the sensitive issue of immigration reform has now been afforded in the US.The legislative debate on this issue is entering a critical phase, with various proposals under consideration. These include the initiative of Senators McCain and Kennedy in the Senate, mirrored by Representatives Kolbe, Flake and Gutierrez in the House of Representatives. This initiative is the subject of the motion. If the McCain-Kennedy Bill is adopted, it will enable undocumented Irish people to participate in the life of their adopted country, free from fear and uncertainty. It is a proposal of great importance to the Government and I will discuss its provisions in further detail later. In view of our collective concerns and the topical nature of immigration reform in the US, it is both important and timely that we add our voices to the many others that strongly support a pragmatic and sympathetic approach to this sensitive issue. The support of the Seanad for today's motion will serve to strengthen and emphasise our message.In keeping with the very high priority which the Government attaches to the issue of the undocumented Irish abroad, I visited the United States on a number of occasions since becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs just over one year ago. I availed of every opportunity to discuss this issue and to promote the interests of the undocumented. The Seanad can rest assured that I will continue to be active in this regard and I plan to visit three locations in the US next month to meet again with representatives of the immigration centre.In addition to these ongoing political contacts, our ambassador and a team of diplomats throughout the US attach the highest priority to this issue and will continue to proactively ensure that our interests, and those of our citizens, are promoted. The embassy has also been happy to set up programmes for visiting Irish parliamentarians who have generously given of their time and resources to this important issue. I welcome this opportunity to place on record my deep appreciation of the valuable work done by colleagues in this House. In June, the Leader of the Seanad and other Senators visited New York and Washington DC with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, with the specific objective of examining, at first hand, the issue of the undocumented. More recently, Senators Ryan and Mooney joined an Oireachtas delegation led by the Ceann Comhairle. The idea for this motion follows from the useful meetings they had with people, including Senator John McCain, on Capitol Hill.Emigration has always had a central place in the Irish experience and, as a consequence, we feel a deep empathy with the many challenges, the highs and lows, of settling far from home. We understand very well the sadness of separation and the difficulties of adjustment, both for those who have left and those who have stayed behind. Emigration is not simply a sad chronicle of sorrow and regret. It has also been a powerful story of contribution and adaptation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of the Irish in the United States.We are enormously proud of the very significant contribution made over many centuries by the Irish, and our descendants, to the development of the United States of America. While we highlight the rich traditions that join our two countries, we also take pride in the dynamic, progressive relationship our two countries enjoy. We welcome new developments and look forward to our relationship developing further in the future.We are keenly aware that Irish people continue to contribute in a significant way to that country. Many of the young Irish who settled permanently in the US in recent decades now hold significant positions in American universities and business life. Many others, motivated by opportunity rather than necessity, have travelled to the US more recently and are, for example, availing of study and business visas to enhance their experiences.Thankfully, one of the greatest dividends of our economic success has been the reversal of the tide of emigration. This had been a goal of successive Governments. We can take some pride in the fact that the latest CSO figures estimate that in 2005 as many as 19,000 Irish nationals will return to Ireland, while the numbers emigrating will drop to 16,600.While taking pride in our economic prosperity, we are not so far removed from the economic hardship of recent years that we have forgotten the pain of seeing our best and brightest leave, often with no decent prospect of returning home. We are not so far removed from our past that we are willing to turn a blind eye to the loved ones and emigrants who now find themselves in unfortunate and difficult circumstances. We recognise that with our new prosperity comes new responsibilities and opportunities. We understand that meeting the needs of our community living abroad is one such important responsibility and we are fully committed to meeting it.This commitment is reflected in the establishment a few years ago of a dedicated unit within my Department focused entirely on matters relating to the Irish abroad. This has helped to drive progress on the range of issues addressed in the most valuable task force report on emigrants. A further reflection of the extent of the Government's commitment is clear from the substantially increased funding to groups supporting our vulnerable community abroad. Funding is now more than eight times greater than it was in 1997. I assure the House that this commitment and engagement will deepen and grow in the years ahead.While the numbers leaving Ireland for the US are nothing as high as they were, we are nevertheless acutely conscious of the individual stories of hardship and of the impact of the changed circumstances in which they find themselves. The fact that there is no firm figure for the current number of undocumented is a reflection of their life below the radar. We have heard various estimates; a figure of 3,000 has been estimated by the US authorities but this certainly seems to be a low estimate. Some in the Irish community in the US consider that the numbers may be as high as 50,000. I remain of the opinion that the true figure is probably in the region of 25,000. We are conscious nonetheless that the Irish undocumented form a small part of a much larger group of undocumented in the US, where the total number is thought to exceed 10 million. However, the issue is not one of numbers. It is the nature of the undocumented experience, rather than the numbers, that should be our focus.Many of those who now find themselves in difficulty left Ireland to make new lives in the US, often in challenging circumstances. For some, the United States to which they had travelled changed beyond all recognition on 11 September 2001 and almost overnight, they found themselves isolated by international events outside of their control. In the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September, the United States Government moved quickly and decisively to confront the threat of terrorism at home. This was right and fully understandable. As anyone who has been in the US in recent times will testify, tough new security measures have been adopted and continue to affect the daily lives of Americans.The undocumented Irish, like so many others, became caught up in these new measures and suddenly found themselves in a situation for which they had neither planned nor prepared — a situation where they have understandably increasingly retreated to the shadows, fearful of detection. These are decent, hardworking people who, like generations of Irish before them, continue to contribute very positively to their communities. We know they could realise their potential even further if they were to regularise their status. We are determined they will continue to have our full support and access to all the advice and assistance they need in order to achieve this.We are deeply appreciative of the critical support provided by the Irish immigration centres in the United States. The sensitive and effective assistance they offer is of particular relevance in the current climate of heightened stress and uncertainty. During my visit to New York last month, I convened a meeting with representatives of these centres from across the United States to hear at first hand their concerns. This was the first time such a collective meeting took place and I believe we all found it to be a stimulating exchange of views. The representatives of the centres gave me a very detailed briefing on the day-to-day difficulties faced by the undocumented and the types of services they have been developing to meet the needs of this vulnerable group. They also updated me on their work with other Irish people in need of a helping hand such as, for example, older Irish members of our community.In order to support them further in their invaluable work, I announced grants amounting to some €750,000, which is an increase of 40% on last year. The representatives of the centres also emphasised to me the increased spotlight on immigration policy in the United States and the difficult climate for reform. In the context of today's debate, I was heartened when the Irish centres expressed deep appreciation of the interest of the Government and Members of the Oireachtas in this matter.We all appreciate that immigration is a sensitive and divisive issue in the United States, particularly since the tragic events of 11 September 2001. We fully recognise the complexity of the issues involved, and the need to secure consensus on a comprehensive set of reforms which addresses both the situation of the undocumented and the need for increased security of borders.Hence, as this motion notes, we particularly welcome the high priority being given to this issue by the United States President and Congress. In my contacts with political leaders in the United States, I have been struck by their determination to advance reforms. In particular, I am deeply appreciative of the high priority which President Bush attaches to it. When the Taoiseach and I met the President on 17 March this year, he assured us of his commitment to working with Congress and to advancing progress on this issue.This motion expresses the Seanad's strong support for measures introduced by US Senators Kennedy and McCain and their colleagues in the House of Representatives. Their Secure America and Orderly Immigration Bill represents a serious and considered effort by two distinguished Senators, with long records of public service, to reform the immigration system and to regularise the position of undocumented people. Their very significant and positive Bill provides for a route to legality for undocumented people. Such people would be able to regularise their status by applying for a temporary residency visa. They would receive work and travel authorisation, which would provide them with greater protection in the work place and allow them to travel to and from Ireland without fear of being refused re-entry to the US. This would be a great relief to them and to their families.A further and most significant aspect of the Kennedy-McCain Bill which distinguishes it from other proposals is that it includes a path to permanent residency. As I stated earlier, there have been a number of other immigration Bills introduced in both Houses of Congress, all with their own emphasis and policy direction. We welcome the positive engagement of all those who are contributing to the debate on this important issue. We understand that divergence in points of view is to be expected. The focus of today's motion on the Kennedy-McCain initiative arises because from an Irish point of view, it represents by far the best approach.We know the legislative debate on immigration in the United States will be lively and lengthy. We also understand that the outcome of the debate is uncertain. Members who have visited the United States in recent times will have come away with this impression of the situation. In light of the current focus on immigration reform in the United States and of the deep concern here about the issue, I am convinced it is very important that we give the clearest expression of our strong support of the approach adopted by Senators Kennedy and McCain and their colleagues in the House of Representatives.The Members of the Seanad can be assured that the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States has and will continue to have the highest priority for the Government. In the critical period ahead, we will intensify our efforts to support measures, in particular those proposed in the Kennedy-McCain Bill, which would allow our undocumented citizens to regularise their situation and enjoy greater peace of mind. I thank the Members and Senator Mooney for proposing the motion and I look forward to the debate.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I welcome the Minister to the House. It is significant the Seanad will now join the Dáil in passing this motion and in showing the strength of support in the Oireachtas for the Irish community who are undocumented in the United States. I agree with everything the Minister has said. Above all, I want to reflect on and reiterate his statement that "we understand that meeting the needs of our community living abroad is one such important responsibility and we are fully committed to meeting it".It is rather strange that ten or 15 years ago, the question of the illegal Irish in the United States was a big domestic political issue in this House and in the body politic. Thereafter, we thought the problem had resolved itself with the strong economic growth and performance in Ireland. While we did not expect the issue to re-emerge, it has done so and must now be dealt with. We are fortunate that efforts are now being made in the US Senate and House of Representatives to try to bring help and hope to the undocumented.As the Minister has noted, it is difficult to quantify the numbers involved. I was involved in one of the visits by parliamentarians to Washington earlier in the year, as part of a delegation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. Every meeting we attended gave us a different impression as to the numbers of undocumented or illegal Irish. The Minister has attempted to fix upon a figure of approximately 25,000, which appears to be a reasonable estimate.One big difference I noted at that time compared to my visit to the United States in 1989 was that in 1989, the illegal Irish in New York and elsewhere in north America were well organised and had a strong leadership group. On this occasion, possibly because a different type of immigrant is affected or because the type of undocumented situation differs, there does not appear to be the same leadership among the undocumented in the United States. This is a difficulty. In that regard, Members should note the enormous efforts being made by church charities and by Irish communities in the United States in trying to achieve unity and a sense of purpose among the undocumented. This is extremely important.While I welcome the passing of this motion, we must also be realistic as to what will be eventually passed by the United States Congress from the perspective of immigration control and security. We must also be realistic about the timeframe. When we visited the United States earlier this year, expectations were high that major impetus would be given to the immigration and visa issue by the autumn session or by winter. However the entire congressional calendar will now have changed, given the effects of the hurricanes in Florida and the ensuing crisis across the southern states. At best, the expected timeframe for the immigration issue to receive serious debate will be put back for a significant number of months. We must be patient.As regards the specific proposal supported by this motion, we all recognise it would be the best solution for the Irish community. However, we must also recognise there are a significant number of visa Bills now before the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is fair to state that although with any luck, legislation will be passed next year, it is likely to be a merger of quite a number of Bills. As the Minister has stated, we would be most happy if the Kennedy-McCain Bill was passed because of the residency options it would provide to the undocumented Irish in the United States. However, we must take whatever is on offer.In the 1980s and early 1990s, such people wished to remain in the United States permanently. However, unlike then and given the opinions of many people I met on the joint committee's visit as well as of many undocumented people of whom I am personally aware, my understanding is that many undocumented immigrants want work permits and certainty about the ability to travel to and fro. These are their immediate priorities. For some, residency would be preferable but we must actively work to ensure the undocumented become documented, that they will have work permits and will be able to return home for family functions such as funerals, weddings, etc.When we hold debates on visa programmes we all support whichever programme is on offer. There is no political divide in this respect. We can ignore the fact we are possibly failing to take full advantage of some of the programmes in place. This point was made very strongly to Senator Mooney, myself and other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs by former US Congressman, Bruce Morrison, who will be fondly remembered in Ireland due to the Morrison visa programme. He asked and challenged us to try to take fuller advantage of some of the current schemes. We should take his advice and try to amend the Walsh diversity visa programme as only a tiny percentage of these visas have been taken up.Former Congressman Morrison suggested we should seek an extension of the J1 worker programme as opposed to the student visa programme. Another of his suggestions and one the Minister should act upon is that we should enter into a bilateral programme on working holiday visas with the US. That is the arrangement in place between Ireland and Australia in that Irish students can travel to and work in Australia for 12 months and Australian students can do likewise here. We should attempt to develop a working holiday programme with the US.The issue of undocumented immigrants is a major problem but there are other means of addressing aspects of the problem rather than proposing a single immigration Bill. I hope we will examine these means. I have a deep appreciation for what Senators McCain and Kennedy are attempting to do at a very different level than has been previously the case. There is strong all-party support and two of the most senior members of the Senate are involved. It also occurs during a time of a changed political climates in the US. Even the Title of the Bill tells its own tale in that it is no longer an immigration Bill or a visa Bill but the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Bill.We must concede and recognise the fact that security is the prime issue in the US. In the 1980s, the so-called "illegals" did not comprise an issue that got prime political attention. However, the matter of undocumented immigrations has now been mixed with the security issue. For this reason any solution will be as much about the security side of the equation as the visa side. In some of the meetings held by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs with various Senators and legal representatives, the strong message the committee received was that security was first on the agenda and visas were second.As this debate develops over the next number of months, we hope the Bill will be taken seriously by the members of Congress and that a compromise proposal will be made. I welcome today's debate, which is a small but significant show of support from the Irish Houses of Parliament. It is important that our support be conveyed to the US Congress. We are all aware of Senator Kennedy's record on Irish issues and we welcome on board Senator John McCain, a very senior politician, and their colleagues in the House of Representatives. However, it would be unrealistic to expect this Bill will have an easy passage. We must accept there will be compromises, additions and subtractions but what is important is that the issue of undocumented immigrants is addressed.It was made clear to the members of the committee that, while the number of undocumented persons in the US is large and possibly unquantifiable, all of these people are working and contributing to the country's economy. One public representative who visited the committee conceded that, without the undocumented labour force in the US, American agriculture and horticulture would shut down. Therefore, it is in the interests of the US and its economy to resolve the issue and ensure that work permits, whether they are straightforward work permits or permits leading to permanent residency, are put in place, the sooner the better.We must be cautious about sending signals of absolute optimism to the Irish community in the US due to the change in the congressional calendar and other issues arising from events surrounding Hurricane Katrina. When in Washington, I felt strong, positive vibes that the issue is being taken seriously. I welcome this and suggest we should use whatever influence we have through this House and our embassy staff, who are doing outstanding work, to keep in touch with American policy makers and help put in place a programme for the 10,000, 15,000 or 25,000 undocumented Irish in the US. I ask the Minister to take Bruce Morrison's advice to examine schemes currently in place and determine how we can build upon and expand them so that any of them that are good for Ireland are also good for the US.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I welcome the Minister to the House and am aware of his interest in this matter as we have recently received various statements from him regarding it. There is no doubt that the events of 11 September 2001 changed America profoundly, especially in respect of security awareness. It plunged many Irish illegal immigrants, as they are classified in America, into a twilight world of uncertainty in which it is no longer possible to obtain a driver's licence, which, in many cases, gives them access to their workplaces. It also plunged them into a situation whereby they cannot return home and attend family funerals. Many of us have been approached by families in our constituencies regarding sons and daughters living in the uncertain environment of the US. They wonder whether we could give any positive assurances concerning potential changes in America or that there could be a degree of recognition for the immigrants there. The McCain-Kennedy Bill was a glimmer of hope when its date was moved to May 2005. I am sure that everyone here wishes God speed to the Bill in the US House of Representatives and we hope that something good emerges from it.The number of Irish illegal immigrants there is not low. The Minister has cited the estimate that the figure is consistently approximately 25,000. However, the Bill will also have profound effects on Mexican and other nationalities. Senator Bradford is correct in that the US economy has become dependent on people classified as illegal immigrants, which is similar to the situation in Ireland. Emigrants work on the lower end of the economic scale. Many of those who migrated from the former accession EU countries are probably working at the lower end of the wage scale but are making very valuable contributions towards sustaining our economy, especially in the hospitality sector and elsewhere.I am aware of a number of illegal immigrants in the US who are highly educated. As such, they are making a valuable contribution to American society and perpetuate the history of generations of Irish people building the US. I hope the passage of the legislation through the US House of Representatives and Senate will be successful. I look forward, if it is enacted, to witnessing its subsequent impact.I recently read the record of a debate that took place in the Lower House regarding Irish emigrants who went to the UK many years ago and many of whom are now elderly. These people should not be forgotten because they made a very valuable contribution, when the Celtic tiger did not exist and when the economy was less buoyant, by sending money home from England. Many of those to whom I refer have fallen on hard times. Will the Minister indicate the level of funding the Department of Foreign Affairs is giving to the different bodies in the UK that deal with Irish emigrants? The amount of funding available was topped up after the debate on emigration in the Lower House. We should not forget these people living in the UK in the circumstances to which I refer or the organisations that do valuable work for them.I will conclude because I do not wish to repeat what colleagues have already said. I encourage the Minister to keep the momentum going on this issue and I hope he will be successful.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I welcome the Minister. Without engaging in hyperbole, I wish to state that the tabling of this motion represents an historic event in the distinguished history of the House. The motion is equal in significance to that taken in the Lower House. Over 50 years ago, both Houses of the Oireachtas debated the problems of emigration. It is difficult to believe at this remove that our predecessors could have in any way foreseen that the Government would reach out to the members of its separated diaspora in the US, through our friends in the that country's Legislature, in order to regularise their circumstances. We are talking about people who have left Ireland voluntarily, as distinct from those who had no option but to leave.I acknowledge and put on the record, without any reflection on anyone else, the outstanding contribution made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this issue. It has proven to be fruitful and is an indication of the commitment he has shown to this specific area and to the Irish diaspora in the US and UK, with which I am familiar. He hit the ground running and followed on from the outstanding work of his predecessor, Deputy Cowen, who is now Minister for Finance. It is somewhat interesting that the Minister for Finance had an immediate empathy with his successor in respect of the release of funds. When the Estimates are agreed later this year, I hope there will be a further increase in funding for the Irish diaspora.I also acknowledge the work done by the Taoiseach. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out, he was present in March 2005 when this specific issue was raised. When one considers all the other important issues facing the White House and the Irish Government and the Taoiseach, the fact that time was given to a small but extremely important and significant group of Irish nationals who have found themselves in a legal limbo in the US is to this Government's credit. I make no excuses if this sounds party political and is an example of hyperbole. It is not a reflection on anyone; I am merely stating the facts as I see them and as I have known them to be since this issue first arose.Despite the best efforts of Irish-American politicians over 15 years to address the issue of illegal immigration through measures such as the Donnelly, Morrison and Walsh visa schemes, there remains a small but significant residual group of Irish nationals in the US who, as other speakers and the Minister indicated, have found themselves cut adrift. This is primarily the result of the environment in the US following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. It is ironic to recall the different environment that existed in the 1980s when various visa lotteries were implemented. Such visas allowed significant numbers of Irish citizens — who would not otherwise have had the opportunity to do so — to work in the US and gain the expertise and experience with which they gladly and enthusiastically returned to this country and which is helping to drive its engine of growth.It is estimated that 250,000 people left our shores during the 1980s and that most of these individuals returned during the past seven or eight years. Those who chose to remain in the US took a chance, despite the fact that the visa waiver programme, which has been operating for some years, was evident to all who were travelling. They took this chance because the atmosphere in the US meant that employers and state agencies did not pursue them, particularly if they kept their heads down, paid their taxes, were good Americans and contributed to the economy.It is somewhat ironic, as we discovered at our various meetings and as the Minister knows, that undocumented people in the US pay taxes. It seems that there is a large escrow account which contains several billions of dollars generated by the taxation of undocumented people. The question arises as to why it is not possible for the state to identify them and send them back. There has been an ambiguous attitude towards illegal immigrants working in the US, primarily because of the vastness of the country and the strength of its economy.Senator Bradford is correct to say that there is an enormous number of undocumented people in the US. The Minister also touched upon this issue when he stated that the official estimate is approximately 11 million or 12 million. Some people to whom we spoke in recent months on Capitol Hill indicated that the figure could be 15 million or more. The problem lies in the fact that these people are undocumented so nobody knows how many of them exist. Practically all of them work and they are not a burden on the state. It is because of this that the initiatives in the last few years have come about, specifically the initiative of the distinguished Senators Edward Kennedy and John McCain. This initiative culminated in the introduction of legislation with the rather unwieldy title of the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act last May.In our discussions with Senators Kennedy and McCain and other Congressmen on this legislation, it became apparent that if there was to be any hope of meaningful immigration reform passed by both Houses of Congress, it needed to have a security dimension attached to it. The word "amnesty" does not appear anywhere in the legislation because the latter is no longer acceptable on Capitol Hill. This is primarily because most members of both Houses of Congress felt this issue had been dealt with to an advanced degree by the introduction of amnesties dating back to 1986. When the first of the amnesty bills to address illegal immigration was introduced in that year, people believed that would be the end of the matter. It became apparent as the years passed that, because of the way of the world, the size of the American economy and the fact that the border between Mexico and the US stretches to 2,700 miles — the border with Canada is also quite long — an increasing number of undocumented people, particularly those from the south, were pouring in. The vast majority of undocumented people in the US are nationals from Mexico, Central America and South America. I suggest that the percentage is 90% to 95%.The Irish experience involved the emigration of mainly single males and females going back to pre-Famine days. Due to increased security restrictions along the border between Mexico and the US and the existence of "coyotes"— mercenaries who operate on the southern side in particular and who charge individuals and families significant sums of money to get them across — there has been an explosion of undocumented families, particularly in the frontline border states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas. Recent census statistics from President Bush's home state of Texas indicate that non-Americans make up more than 50% of the population and they outnumber Americans.If anybody knows about undocumented illegals President Bush does, and it is reflected in his commitment to push a meaningful legislative emigration reform programme through both Houses. As a result of this, a number of Congressmen in the frontline States — I use the generic word Congressman in a non-gender manner — are deeply hostile to this Bill and will vote against it. That they have joined in the battle means it is far from over.I had the privilege of visiting the United States on three occasions since last May. On the first occasion, my friend and colleague, Deputy Cregan, and I represented Fianna Fáil. In June I was part of a Foreign Affairs delegation which also included my colleague Senator Bradford. Last month I was privileged to have been asked to participate in an annual bilateral discussion in what is known loosely as the Irish American parliamentary association. Outside of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, it is the only interparliamentary organisation of Irish and other politicians that meets regularly in the respective home countries. We go there one year and then they come to us. It is another indication of the strong links at political level between Ireland and the United States, apart from those in the business, social and economic life of the United States outlined in the Minister's speech.I stated this is an historic event because it is the first time the two Houses of the Oireachtas have responded to a specific request from a senior-ranking US Senator, who reached out to his Irish cousins and asked them to give him public support for the legislation he and Senator Kennedy have proposed. Senators Kennedy and McCain specifically requested this and I was privileged to have been present when the request was made to the delegation. In that context, I reiterate my deep appreciation for the alacrity with which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, acted once it became apparent this request had been formally and officially made. It was more than coincidental that he was on official duties in New York during that week. He was able to act and respond immediately to the advice he received from the delegation, his party colleagues and, importantly, from the Irish Embassy in Washington led by the ambassador, Mr. Noel Fahy. The Minister rightly mentioned that.I wish to put on the record and acknowledge the outstanding contribution the Irish Embassy made to ensure doors were open to us on all of our visits, including those of the highest-ranking politicians on the hill, and also the manner in which the embassy staff were able to interpret the political environment in which we operated. They gave us the advice we required to engage in talks to convince a number of US politicians of the existence of an Irish dimension to what they perceived until this year as an exclusively Mexican and Central and South American problem. It surprised a number of long-standing sympathetic Irish-American politicians that an Irish dimension existed. They had not come across it, even in their home states.That returns to the point made by the Minister on the numbers involved. This is not a numbers game, but inevitably the question arises as to how many were involved. Nobody can answer with any degree of certainty but the figure quoted in the Minister's speech is a fair average. Even if only 1,000 or 5,000 are affected as has been stated here, those individuals and their families suffer personal anguish on a weekly and monthly basis whenever a family event occurs. If it is a happy event one can sigh with some sympathy and express pity that the person did not make it home for a birth, confirmation or communion. However, as is the case in a number of instances of which I and my colleagues are aware, it can involve a death or lingering illness and there is no chance a son or daughter will see his or her mother or father alive again. Usually the person involved has been in the United States for approximately ten years and the pain of returning to Ireland is in leaving behind all that has been built up over those ten years, knowing once he or she returns to Ireland he or she will not be able to get back to the United States within the lifetime of the individual he or she has come to see. Under the visa waiver programme, if one overstays by more than 12 months, one is debarred from re-entering the United States for ten years, and in the present security climate there is no guarantee one would be allowed to return even then. That is the harsh reality for a significant number of Irish families in practically every constituency in the country, especially in constituencies with a tradition of emigration, such as my own.My county has haemorrhaged people. In 1841 it had a population of 240,000 and the last census recorded a population of 26,000. Most of them went to the United States. I feel so passionately about this issue and issues relating to the Irish diaspora because of my personal experience and the fact that I am a former emigrant. As I have often stated in this House, I understand to some degree the pain of emigration because I had to leave. It was not a voluntary decision.I concur with the comments made that those involved are good Americans in the American context and they pay taxes. The problem must be addressed. The President of the United States indicated his full support for an emigration reform programme. Senators McCain and Kennedy, who are bipartisan and come from both sides of the House, are fully committed to this Bill. In the previous meetings to which I referred, the mood was not one of great confidence. However, I hope Senator Ryan will speak on this later and confirm that after we met with Senator McCain in September we left buoyed with confidence that this Bill would be successful. When one considers that Senator McCain, a senior-ranking Republican tipped to be a possible presidential candidate in 2008, gave us 50 minutes of his time it gives an indication of his commitment to this issue.In the short time left to me I wish to acknowledge all initiatives taken by the Government to help the Irish abroad, not only those in the American context but to that closest to me, namely, those in England. In particular, I acknowledge the initiative taken to allow those in receipt of pre-1953 pensions, which accounts for approximately 70% of the Irish in Britain, to enjoy a 50% increase in their pensions on top of their UK pensions. It has cost the Irish taxpayer €100 million and it is money well spent. It has been outstandingly successful and I acknowledge the role of the Federation of Irish Societies in particular for ensuring the passage of information, as did two national newspapers representing the Irish, the Irish Post and the Irish World.I also compliment the Minister on establishing the emigrants abroad unit. I am pleased to see Ms Síle Maguire is in the House to advise the Minister. I have dealt with her particularly on the issue of the Irish in Britain and she is an outstanding public servant. I hope she conveys our thanks and appreciation to the head of that unit, Mr. Seán Farrell, for his outstanding work.I appreciate the Leas-Chathaoirleach is indulging me with regard to speaking time. My final point is to suggest that the Minister might consider changing the law to permit US citizens, particularly students, who wish to experience Ireland extend their stay. Similar legislation might then be passed in the United States to allow young Irish people extend their stay. According to the law in both countries, one can only stay for three months and one cannot work or stay beyond that point. Increasingly, young Irish people are not travelling to the United States and many Irish-Americans and American nationals wish to visit Ireland because it is the place to be. This would further bilateral relations between the two countries. We know from our discussions with American politicians that they would welcome this legislation and I ask the Minister to pursue this in his dealings with them and his colleagues in Cabinet. This is an historic and significant day for the House. I fully support the motion on which I have been privileged to speak. I wish the Minister and his staff continued success.

It is important to remember that the legislation does not solely relate to undocumented Irish people. In fact, they are a very small part of what is seen in the United States as a most serious problem. One need only look at the physical changes made on Capitol Hill in terms of the bunkers built there to realise the change in the mentality that has taken place in the United States since the attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Centre.The terrorist attacks were particularly terrible for a people who promote globalisation that leads to a greater movement of not just capital but also labour. Every country must be in a position to close its borders, particularly in order to exclude people with diseases and so forth. This shock has been most terrible for the United States. I foresee serious problems in bringing forward the Bill.While I support what the Minister is trying to do, I hope that, in the context of what we are asking the United States to do, he will reciprocate in terms of immigrants to this country——

Anyone who saw the recent production of the Arthur Miller play, "A View from the Bridge", which deals with the terror faced by illegal Italian immigrants should realise that a similar terror is faced by immigrants to a country where their documentation is not deemed proper and should be sympathetic about people who have come here as well as those who left this country for the United States.I substituted for Senator Quinn at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs last week. Some members of the committee were extremely tough on those who came before it to speak about human trafficking in this country. It was stated that referring to vague numbers was not enough and that those present would be obliged to arrive at exact numbers so that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, would be more sympathetic to their case. However, that is all we can do regarding the number of illegal Irish people in the United States. We do not know if there are 5,000, 25,000 or 50,000 such individuals.The Minister should ensure that a sympathetic approach is taken to people who are in this country illegally. They may not have been smuggled into Ireland but may have come here legally on work permits. As work permits are held by employers, employees can easily have part of their wages creamed off to pay for them. Pay is the wrong word to use; it is really a form of blackmail designed to keep people in particular jobs. Such people are in most vulnerable positions because if an employer withdraws a work permit, the employee will then have to leave the country. I ask the Minister to examine this matter.I hope the authorities in the United States will look at the figures for legal immigration into that country. The number was lower last year than has been the case for three decades. It has become so difficult to enter the United States that people are now choosing to seek entry to other English speaking countries such as Canada or Australia or to states of the European Union other than Ireland. This year, the American ambassador, Mr. Kenny, was reduced to going around the universities to encourage students to apply for J1 visas so they would go to the United States, work there and at least get a flavour of the American way of life which so many of us experienced in the past. I ask that it be put to those in the United States who are opposed to the Bill that people are already there who may be ready to become splendid citizens of a country where fewer legal immigrants are arriving.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I thank Senator Henry for sharing time. I welcome the Minister and concur with the support expressed for him and the motion. It is important that we look at this issue in a way that can make a difference for young Irish people in the United States.It is most important that we say to those people on Capitol Hill who oppose this proposed legislation that every single economy in the world that has had an influx of immigrants has reaped a significant reward and benefit in the following generation. The children of immigrants have always proven to make a significant injection into the economy in which they live. Many young Irish people have arrived in foreign places with an eagerness to contribute and they now find themselves in a position where they cannot obtain driving licences and where simple matters such as banking are almost impossible. The same is true of attending a doctor, providing or gaining a medical history, getting married or obtaining the documentation people need for their daily lives. Life is proving impossible for these undocumented, illegal people in the United States. Difficulties are also encountered when it comes to insurance, particularly medical insurance, and even simple things such as credit cards.These people are forced into a black economy. They are obliged to enter the shadows and not participate in the everyday work and life of the society in which they live. They are cast as criminals even though they have done nothing illegal in terms of their daily activities. As has already been said, they are paying taxes, adding to productivity and making a serious contribution to the economy of the United States. However, they are unacknowledged, unrecognised, undocumented and invisible within that country's economy.Any efforts the Minister makes will be supported by groups on all sides. Perhaps there are not many votes in this and for that reason it reflects well on Irish political life that people from both sides can come together in both Houses to say that they want something done for the individuals in question. We are all aware of families where parents worry every single night about their son or daughter in the United States who does not have the comfort and protection of citizenship, legality, etc. There is also the concern regarding whether they can get treatment if something happens to them. It is unlikely that they can ever come home for family occasions, be they occasions of sorrow or joy. They are effectively in exile.That is why it is important from our point of view that we look at what is required on Capitol Hill. Is it possible that the State, under the control and authority of the Irish ambassador to Washington, would organise a full briefing of all the people who are worried about this matter on Capitol Hill. They should lobby all the people over there, put the points to them and see what we can give back. Senator Mooney made an important point about some reciprocation in terms students from the United States coming to Ireland so that there would be flexibility in movement between the two countries. That is something important which should be done. The easiest way for this to be achieved would be if there was no longer any need for Irish people travelling to and from the United States to obtain visas. In this global society, we should be seen as a benign nation and there should be a free movement of labour between both economies. It would not be a significant problem for either side to come to arrangement on this.It is up to us to show the support of these Houses to Senators McCain, Kennedy and others who have taken an important step to recognise the unrecognised and to give life back to these lost people in the Unites States' economy, namely, the illegal Irish immigrants who are marginalised, excluded and vulnerable. They are prevented from participation and it behoves us to do our best for them.In 1988 I raised in this House the importance of giving emigrants a voice in Irish society. I still believe there is a case for giving a restricted representation for emigrants in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am not referring to an out-of-control proposal that would suddenly result in Irish emigrants in the United States or United Kingdom running Irish politics or dictating Irish policies. We would establish a line of contact were we to give representation and a voice to Irish emigrants, in this House in particular but perhaps also in the other House. This could and should be done and it would bring us closer to understanding the needs, worries and concerns of those about whom we speak.In 1988, when I made this proposal, I could not obtain any support from the main political parties. Some time later, some Members on the Fine Gael Front Bench supported it. There is certainly wider support for it today. In this regard, Senator Mooney has supported my view on a number of occasions. When I spoke on this subject in 1988 I got a very good reception in London. However, I read an Irish emigrant newspaper — I forget which one — the following week and, to my surprise, I noted I was being castigated for making an appalling proposal. I looked at the name of the person who wrote the article and who had a go at my proposal to support Irish emigrants and I noted it was a person I had not heard of or seen before. It was somebody called Conor Lenihan, an Irish emigrant working in the United Kingdom. Twenty years later he has become a Minister of State in this country. Maybe he has changed his mind on the matter in the meantime.I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, well with this motion.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I am happy to add my strong support to this important initiative. We are very lucky to have friends in the United States such as Senators Kennedy and McCain and representatives Kolbe, Flake and Gutierrez. We are also lucky to have former Taoiseach, John Bruton, nicely positioned in Washington as European Union representative. I am sure he would never consider abusing that position but it is always valuable to have people present to create a climate of opinion.I am curious as to why there seems to be so much dispute about the figures. The United States Government seems to believe there are 3,000 illegal Irish immigrants. Others say there are 50,000 and the Minister says there are approximately 25,000. He suggested some kind of computer tracking but this seems to have fizzled out.In his speech, the Minister stated: "In the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September, the United States Government moved quickly and decisively to confront the threat of terrorism at home." In spite of all my goodwill towards the United States, I do not agree with that statement. Its Government moved clumsily and ineffectively to address the threat. It actually inhibited seriously the civil and human rights of its own citizens and those of people seeking to enter the United States, either for travel or business, or permanently.The United States has traditionally experienced mass immigration. In all countries, including our own, people get pernickety over these issues. I sometimes wonder how legal was the mass influx of people into America, North and South, in the initial stages. Did anybody invite the people in, were they vetted and did they have proper permits? We flooded the United States with European people who wiped out as many members of the indigenous population as they could. On the penetration of the United States from Mexico, most of the people concerned are the descendants of people who were in North America long before the Untied States was every contemplated. This is a little ironic.Figures from Homeland Security statistics suggest that, between 1981 and 1990, Ireland contributed 31,969 people. In the ten-year period from 1991 to 2000, this figure rose to 56,900, which is almost 60,000. However, in 2001, this number dropped to between 1,000 and 1,500 and remained at approximately this level ever since. This tells a tale. Between 2000 and 2004, some 273 Irish people were actually deported from the United States. This also shows a change in attitude in that country.Although I am sometimes a critic of the Roman Catholic Church, I believe it, including some of its current and past bishops, among them Bishop Eamon Casey, has done very remarkable, generous and good-hearted work on behalf of Irish emigrants in both Britain and the United States. It was very interesting that Bishop Seamus Hegarty launched the initiative Supporting the Irish Abroad. I read a very interesting article by Fr. Michael Leonard, who drew a very interesting comparison between the slavery of Saint Patrick in Ireland and the conditions of Irish emigrants abroad. He states: "Because many of them are ‘illegal' they are forced to work longer hours for less wages and with none of the benefits, which are available to the rest of the work force." Let me put this in a particular context and refer to a statement by a very distinguished female cleric, Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, who has worked tirelessly for the poor of this country. She stated migrant workers on work permits in Ireland tend to be in low-paid work, often below the minimum wage, and that finding good quality affordable accommodation can be difficult. She also claimed that, as work permits are of a temporary nature, there is little guarantee of permanent employment and that, as a result, people are forced to stay in rented accommodation. Is it not interesting to put these two views together?The people Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy refers to are migrant workers, who are in the country legally. What about the asylum seekers and refugees? Although I support the initiative under discussion, I cry shame on a Government that does not see the discrepancy between what it is asking the United States to do for our people and the way in which we treat people who come to this country in identical circumstances. We have forgotten the nature of the Irish experience in Britain and America. It is shameful. It is inappropriate for Ministers to trot around telling cock and bull stories to the effect that many asylum seekers are bogus without stating any referenced facts.Let me put on the record the case of a Nigerian man who came here in 2000, as I did some days ago on the Order of Business. In that year he applied for refugee status in Ireland on humanitarian grounds but was denied. On 11 September, that extraordinary date, he was found washed up in Skerries after having committed suicide. He was denied the right to stay in this country and was to be forcibly repatriated. He killed himself on foot of a deportation order. This was not a cock and bull story but the story of somebody who felt the alternative of taking his own life was preferable to returning to the country in which he had been born. We, as citizens of this country, with all our privileges, should bear that in mind and remember that the experience of such people entering our country must be considered with the same sensitivity we request from the authorities in the United States.Let me conclude by quoting one of the most splendid politicians of the past 30 or 40 years, that is, Senator Edward Kennedy. When in America I have often watched him on C-SPAN television. He is not in the glare of publicity but is working hard and with real political intelligence and moral commitment on a raft issues. He really got it right when he stated: "We offer a fair deal: if they are willing to work hard for us openly, then we're willing to do something fair for them. It's long past time to put the underground economy, above ground, and recognize the reality of immigrants in our workforce." Hear, hear, say I. However, let us learn this lesson ourselves and apply it to the circumstances in our own jurisdiction and not just try to teach it to the Americans.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House and congratulate him and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the work they are doing on this very important issue. I read with interest and very much welcomed the Minister's statement on this motion in the Dáil. I compliment Senator Mooney and the Members of this House who have travelled to the United States on a number of occasions to raise the issue. Senator Mooney mentioned he has done so on three occasions this year.The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has had much discussion on this matter. One of the committee's positive initiatives was to invite the US ambassador, Mr. Kenny, to one of its meetings to discuss it. There was some controversy at the time because he wanted to hold the meeting in private. Indeed, as it transpired, he was well able to handle the matter and he would have had no difficulty if the meeting had been public. He made the important point that he deals with many of the matters regarding the undocumented in private. It was a useful meeting. That we met him and his staff at the embassy meant that we were able to contact him about many of the concerns we have about people we know. We all have relatives and friends in the United States. As Galway representatives, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and I are aware that this issue is very relevant to that county. It was great to meet the ambassador and to have a good discussion with him.I made a point that day which has been raised by other Members as regards American students or citizens in this country. They seem to be treated badly, even in terms of work permits and matters relating to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I cannot understand why American students have to return home so quickly from this country. There should be an extension of time, as recommended by many of the Senators who spoke before me. We welcome all citizens of the European Union, but we do not know them as well as we do the people and representatives of the United States of America. There is a glaring inconsistency in the manner in which the members of one jurisdiction are treated by comparison with members of the other.I brought the issue of a highly qualified chef from the United States to the notice of the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and employment and indeed, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Unfortunately, the person was forced to return to the United States because it was felt there were too many chefs in the country. That is something that should be examined. This person was highly qualified in the area of Japanese cuisine and that is not common in Ireland. We must put our house in order as regards such issues because we cannot continually say that more needs to be done for our Irish emigrants if we are not prepared to review the situation in respect of people who come here from the United States. I have asked the US ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Kenny, to look at that situation, also.I was in New York in May at a meeting concerned with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty around the same time that Senator Mooney was in Washington. At a break in proceedings, after listening to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, it was interesting to talk to people we met from Ireland, above all the embassy staff in New York. They told us of some of the difficulties in which Irish people find themselves when trying to get work. As Senator O'Toole said, there is obviously a black economy there, because people are not able to get their tax affairs in order. We heard many stories, for example, if a person is being charged with a driving offence as simple as not having the correct lights on, it means that not only is he or she in trouble — all the passengers are too. There might be a disturbance in a house where all those resident, not only the culprit, find themselves in difficulty.I cannot understand why, when a person is in difficulty in, say, Boston, he or she can be taken away without their families being contacted for up to three or four days. In some instances of which I am aware, people have been transferred from Boston to New York and there is enormous difficulty in making contact. We have raised this issue with our ambassador and I hope this area will be improved on. I am aware that I am citing particular examples but the overall issue of importance is to get the Kennedy-McCain Bill enacted. I want to compliment Senators McCain and Kennedy, whom I have met, as well as members of the House of Representatives, who are employing might and main to resolve this issue. There has been lobbying in the past as regards Morrison and Donnelly visas and a great deal of work was done in getting those through. There was the issue of a lottery to decide who should get visas. In some instances people were somewhat disappointed at the manner in which that was handled. It was at least an attempt to try to deal with the issue of a great many Irish people who were undocumented. There is much more work to do, however. Even though there was a good deal of emigration in the 1980s, there are very many Irish people out there now who possess a far greater spirit of adventure than existed in my time as a teenager. People are travelling and Irish people are certainly on the move. We all want to see issues concerning the undocumented dealt with.Senator O'Toole made the point about representation for emigrants in a general way and I am totally in agreement with him. In the past we examined the possibility of voting rights for emigrants. If the vote for emigrants to the US were allowed, Deputy Treacy and I would be campaigning in Boston rather than east Galway, given the great numbers of Irish domiciled in some of the US cities. As regards representation for emigrants in the Oireachtas, the Seanad is an obvious place for such an initiative. Great work has been done by some organisations in cities throughout Europe and, indeed, the United States. The DION funding, which the Minister has increased this year, is obviously a very important mechanism for them. I hope we can continue to increase that.I again welcome this debate. We could discuss a great many issues. In conclusion, President Bush has rightly been criticised for many of the issues in which he was involved, the war in Iraq in particular, as discussed often in this House. However, this is one that he supports strongly and which he knows is of enormous importance for Irish immigrants as well as many other nationalities. He could make his mark in this regard by accepting that this is a good Bill worthy of his support. Hopefully, this legislation will be enacted in the United States.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Even though there are only about six Members in the Chamber, this debate is quite astonishing, in the most positive sense. Seanad Éireann is replicating what was done in Dáil Éireann. The initiative in both Houses arose because one of the most influential members of the US Senate told us that it would be of assistance to himself and Senator Kennedy in achieving something. This is not a matter of government to government or official to official. It is members of one parliament talking to members of another and, as Senator Mooney can confirm, without any pressure from any of the Irish delegation. We were immensely grateful that Senator John McCain devoted an hour of his day to talking to us. As any Member who has sat in the Chair of this House will know, we Irish parliamentarians do not use one sentence when we can use ten. I do not suggest, for a second, that I am different from anyone else in that regard.It was an extraordinarily wide-ranging and interesting discussion. At the end, the Ceann Comhairle, as leader of the group, asked whether there was anything we could do to assist Senator McCain. He volunteered that it would be useful to him on the floor of Congress if both Houses of the Irish Parliament were to passed a resolution in support of the Bill he and Senator Kennedy have proposed and its equivalent in the House of Representatives. The Irish Embassy in Washington, whose staff, as always, were most helpful to our parliamentary delegation, was more than happy to arrange this.At the risk of sounding a little querulous, although not about other Senators, a smart-arsed journalist — excuse my language, a Chathaoirleach — could have described the visit of seven or eight Members of the Oireachtas to Washington as a junket at the taxpayers' expense. The only reason none has done so is that journalists did not notice our trip. The visit may have been paid for by taxpayers but journalists would not have reported on the progress we made which would not otherwise have been possible. While any Oireachtas delegation visiting Washington would have been as successful as we were, our visit was a worthwhile step in the process of attrition. We were not the first nor will we be the last group of parliamentarians to visit Capitol Hill to discuss issues with Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The objective is to renew acquaintances, listen to them and try to advance issues through persuasion. The combined work of the Government and Members of the Oireachtas at different levels and playing different roles achieved this goal.The issue of the undocumented Irish in America is a poignant reminder of where Ireland used to be and what it has become in a positive sense. In the early 1980s, when my first child was four or five years old, everyone of my age faced the prospect that their children would emigrate because Ireland did not offer them a future. It is difficult to recall how grim this country was at the time. It was probably on the brink of experiencing what Argentina, another country in the developed world, went through when it was in serious danger of sliding backwards.Many of the thousands of young people who left Ireland out of necessity had their status resolved thanks to the goodwill of members of the US Congress. The remaining 25,000 Irish emigrants in the United States — we will not know the figure until the issue of undocumented Irish in the US is resolved — are a little like Oisín i ndiaidh na Féinne in that the world has changed in Ireland and the US. The undocumented Irish need our support because this is no longer the country they left and the United States is no longer the country they entered, having become much colder towards illegal immigrants since the attacks of 11 September 2001. Ireland has also changed as a result of new problems and prosperity.But for the diligence of Members other than me — I did not campaign vigorously on the issue — the undocumented emigrants could have been forgotten. It is a tribute to both Houses, perhaps more so than the Government, that the issue has been vigorously advanced by all sides of the political spectrum and progress is in prospect. The apparent support of President Bush, to which Senator McCain adverted, is extremely important.The intensity of emotion generated by the alleged flood of immigrants in some staunchly republican states such as Arizona, from which Senator McCain hails, requires political courage from the Senator and the President. Senator McCain had no compunction about describing some of the response to immigration as racist. His reasonable position is that he wants to regularise immigrants with a view to developing a sustainable, enforceable policy on immigration.It is clear that if the issue at stake was confined to the position of 25,000 undocumented Irish people, it would be solved in half an hour. The complication is the fear of an invasion of millions of Hispanics. The irony, however, is that large parts of the economy of the United States, particularly in the southern states, would not function without 10 million illegal immigrants. The McCain-Kennedy proposal is an attempt to address the problem.The generosity shown by Senator McCain is a remarkable example of the way in which the US political system works. Although a republican — some of his comments about the German economy defined his view of what a republican would be in the United States — the Senator does not conform to any stereotype on a range of issues. For this reason, he is more likely to have considerable influence. As Senator Mooney noted, his favourite writers are Roddy Doyle and William Trevor.Senator McCain's capacity to be generous and forgive those in Vietnam against whom he could in the eyes of many legitimately feel something other than warmth and forgiveness could be copied by many people on this island in respect of the tradition to which we give our allegiances. He has obviously achieved full reconciliation and told us, for example, that he is probably more widely recognised in Saigon than in some cities in the United States. He is a good example of a person who has forgiven, moved on and left history to others.This is a unique opportunity. Like everyone else, I have friends of my own age or somewhat older who have undocumented children in the United States. One such friend has three successful children with good earning capacity in the United States. All of them are illegal and unable to come home and must instead receive visits from their parents. It is worth remembering that most illegal emigration to the United States occurred about 20 years ago. As the parents of the emigrants in question are 20 years older, they are less likely to be able to travel and more likely to be sick. Moreover, the emigrants are also aging and face all sorts of complications. Unfortunately, if this issue is not resolved, a number of them will be unlikely to visit their parents at home again or, given their parents' age, unlikely to see them in the United States again.As I stated, this is an extraordinary moment because we are passing a resolution in both Houses of the Irish Parliament in order to encourage movement on legislation — at the request of the people sponsoring it — in another sovereign parliament. We are doing it, not because we are interfering or endeavouring to do so, but because we were asked to. It is something we should be glad to do. I am glad to do it. I am glad the Government parties responded as quickly as they did and tabled a motion, which seems eminently sensible and which I and my party will enthusiastically support.

If there is time remaining I would be happy to give it to any of my colleagues.I welcome this debate and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House. Like me, he comes from the west and knows theimplications of this debate and of the ultimate passage of this Bill on many families throughout the west, in particular, but also throughout the country.I am delighted to see that Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy, who have had such a prominent role in promoting Irish affairs in the United States, have come together on a cross-party basis to put this kind of proposal before the US Senate with the support of the US House of Representatives. Many of us who have travelled to the United States over the years have had the opportunity to meet with Senators and Congressmen, particularly those who support the Irish cause and those who would see themselves as part of the strong Irish lobby. For many years other named individuals, such as former Senator Morrison, who supported Bills on visas have had the best interests of the Irish people at heart in trying to frame certain measures and policies to alleviate the kind of difficulties our emigrants have been encountering. This is the boldest effort to date in terms of trying to redress the situation that has evolved over the years and is a breath of fresh air to many families.It is clear that people succeeded for many years in finding ways around a system that existed and, with the acceptance, to some extent, of the US authorities in recognising that people found various means of beating the system to return to Ireland on occasion and then to get back to their workplace and, in many cases, to their families and friends. With the clampdown following 11 September 2001, the kind of procedures that have been put in place on all borders leading to the United States have created a difficult situation for many families. Considering the kind of representations which we receive, I have seen a notable increase in the concerns of families because many of their sons and daughters have not been able to return for happy occasions like weddings and, much more sadly, for the funerals of mothers, fathers, uncles and aunts. That is what has brought about much of the trauma associated with this matter. It is clear that a real effort is being made in the United States. It is also good to see that both Houses here are taking this proactive approach and that there is acceptance of it across the political divide.The problem has been exaggerated in the United States where for many years individuals saw themselves as being there for a short period, building up the necessary reserves to come back, buy a plot of land, build a house and set up a family. In many cases that did not happen, however, and many such individuals went on to get married in the United States and set up families and homes within an economy of which they were a part, often paying taxes through their social security numbers but yet not enjoying the rights applicable to those with the proper legal documentation. That was particularly sad. The position of such people needs to be addressed without delay.I compliment the various efforts, not only of the named individuals in the United States but particularly of those many other Congressmen and Senators who do not necessarily always get marked down as pushing the Irish agenda but who are very much doing so behind the scenes in assisting the other Senators on this. I also compliment the efforts of others, not only of the Ministers and the Taoiseach for their work but also of the Oireachtas delegations mentioned which have been involved and which have worked on a parliament to parliament basis to bring about the necessary changes.The religious orders also have played an important role, in working with the communities in the United States in a quiet way and in working with the people who have fallen through the cracks having travelled to the other side of the ocean, who have not succeeded in getting work or who have not succeeded in sustaining the pace of life over there. The kind of work to which I refer in particular is done by the Irish emigration centres and other support groups, which have been in place to assist, as they have in England and in other jurisdictions. I would be familiar with the situation, particularly along the east coast, both in Boston and New York, and I have seen the tremendous work that has been done.It is also worth noting in a debate like this, not for any reason but to show how much has changed in a few years, that there is now little emigration to the United States whereas 20 or 30 years ago, and long ago, it was a necessity because of the economic situation here. It is particularly helpful that this economy is now in a position to welcome back many of those who emigrated to the US over the years and I hope that trend can continue.It would be remiss of me not to mention the efforts of the Irish diplomatic service, and our ambassadors and the staff within our permanent offices in the US who continually battle and work with both sides on resolving the detail of the necessary legislation to ensure that a Bill could be introduced. The politicians, like all good ones, appear when the final work is done. While they set a policy framework, detailed discussions and work is done elsewhere.I have visited the United States on many occasions and have met with many of these individuals. I have seen the difficulties which they have endured. We need to continue the lobbying effort because there are other issues relating to other ethnic groups. These would have a much greater impact on the economy of the United States because of the numbers involved and would have a desire to see their situations regularised. We must continue our efforts to ensure that we do not get sidetracked by those issues. There are probably reasons that the Irish case is different, largely, we would argue, because of the historic nature of the initial Irish emigration in building the foundation blocks of the United States and the need recognise such effort now by ensuring that our more recent emigrants are catered for in a proper way.There were a couple of references made to our own policies on immigration. We need to look into our hearts and decide on this issue, and work towards proper immigration policies. There has been an effort to draw parallels, but I am not so sure that they are as obvious as some would seek to suggest. It is definitely the case that there are people who come to this country well intentioned. Probably the vast majority of them come very well intentioned and their reputation is sullied to some extent by those who come with dubious ideas regarding the social welfare system, a system which our emigrants did not have in the United States.Notwithstanding that the parallels are not as obvious as some would seek to suggest, there are people who come to this country seeking asylum who where clearly being victimised in their own countries and whose lives were at risk. There are genuine cases and these must be addressed. There is also the issue, of course, that people wish to travel here for economic reasons, which is the same reason many of our people travelled to the United States, and we must address that in a serious and careful way.This is not to suggest that we should open the floodgates simply because the United States is looking kindly on us in this particular circumstance. For many years the authorities there did not do so and they deported at will because they needed an immigration policy that respected the economic reality of their country, namely, that it could not provide for everybody in every other jurisdiction in the world which was in economic difficulty. Our social welfare system has probably made us somewhat more attractive than other destinations and whatever policy is ultimately brought forward must balance all of that. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly support what the Government, the Seanad, the Oireachtas and all parties are doing in regard to this issue and hope that we can continue to assist in whatever way we can to ensure that this Bill is finally enacted.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad to debate this important issue.Many politicians, not just Oireachtas Members but also local public representatives, visit the United States for St. Patrick's Day festivities and get a huge welcome. We only need to visit America to recognise that it has a long history of welcoming people, not just immigrants but perhaps even illegal or undocumented immigrants. The US welcoming philosophy is inscribed on the Statue of Liberty in the immortal words inviting the world to "give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free".American immigration policy has the appearance on paper of being fair, reasonable and highly regulated, but it is in urgent need of reform. A climate exists whereby immigrants are forced to go underground, living on the outskirts of society. In many cases US resources are being spent tracking those who wish to live on the right side of the law, rather than those with more sinister agendas.The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act 2005 was introduced in May 2005, by Senators Edward Kennedy and John McCain, but no new law has been passed nor is any new legislation in place to date. I hope the debate in this House and that held in the Dáil will help the legislation to progress.The Act has four main elements, namely, earned legislation, which gives undocumented immigrants living and working in the United States the opportunity to earn their legal status; family reunification, which would increase the per-country limits for family based and employment based immigrants; future workers, which addresses the future flow of immigrant workers by creating a new H5A temporary visa which will allow foreign workers fill available jobs in the United States; and immigration enforcement, which enhances national security and creates the means to produce a new well functioning immigration system with regard to border security, biometric immigration documents and a new employment confirmation system.Several figures have been bandied about today. However, with a figure of from 5,000 to 50,000 undocumented Irish in the United States — the upper figure being the more credible — the Act's proposals are welcome. The Government must lobby strongly for the implementation of the Kennedy-McCain proposals with the utmost urgency.In common with the figures for the constituencies of every Member of the Oireachtas, a significant number of emigrants from Longford, Westmeath and the midlands area have gone to the United States over the past 25 to 30 years. They, their families and friends at home are conscious of the shadow under which they live their lives. My concern, along with that of my colleagues for emigrants from their parts of the country, is the fear and uncertainty experienced by undocumented Irish workers, most of whom have filled and hold essential jobs, who face the spectre of deportation, leading to the break-up of families, loss of income, ruined career prospects and the inability to return to America after visits home to relations and friends. Senator Mooney and others mentioned some of these who return for funerals or to visit terminally ill parents and relatives.With a figure of 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States, it could be argued that the Irish numbers are relatively low. However, it is up to the Government to ensure that their fate is not pushed aside and lost in the fierce debate on immigration, particularly with regard to the 1 million Mexicans who cross the border every year. No undocumented Irish people will present themselves to the immigration authorities without the protection this legislation would give them. Not only are many of them in well paid skilled work, but many are employers who contribute to the US economy. They have fallen victim to the reaction to the attacks of 11 September 2001, which makes a general amnesty on the lines of the Bruce Morrison visa scheme impossible. However, the Bill as drawn up by Senators Kennedy and McCain would allow previously illegal immigrants to begin the process of legalisation of their status, provided they have no previous criminal record and they pay a small fine.It goes without saying that despite our anxiety to protect and assist our people, the best interest of the US must be protected. The proposed legislation must take its place in line and compete with a time of war, the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice, a major row over the leaking of an undercover operative's name and the effort by President Bush to persuade the American people to invest a portion of their social security in the stock market.The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Reform Act 2005 is in direct opposition to the Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act 2005, on the issue of earned legal residence. That Bill does not offer undocumented immigrants the potential to achieve legal status while remaining in America, but rather proposes to limit legal status to a renewable temporary worker visa after mandatory departure from the United States.There is also a proposal to limit the number of diversity or Schumer visas. Even with the Republic and Northern Ireland qualifying separately, the number of such visas has declined in the past few years. This can be attributed to the fact that the Schumer visas are open to a large number of nations and draw millions of applications worldwide.I welcome this motion as a chance to encourage this lame-duck Government to do everything it can to put the undocumented Irish on the right side of the law of their adopted country.

To be undocumented in a culture such as this is akin to being an anxiety-ridden modern man in an unintelligible, hostile and indifferent world. This is not what we want for our largely forgotten Irish emigrants. I hope the Minister of State will take on board and support the motion before this House. Members have made a valuable contribution on this issue and it is important that their views and proposals reach Capitol Hill. We must broaden the debate and ensure that other US Senators, besides Senators Kennedy and McCain, take note of the issue and ensure the Bill passes through Congress and the US Senate.

We should convey our gratitude to the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for their work on this issue. I refer in particular to their visit to the White House on St. Patrick's Day. I am aware that they have spoken to the US President, Mr. Bush, about this matter. I know that he fully supports the legislation that is before the US Congress. While we do not always agree with President Bush, we should acknowledge that his support for this process has meant that it has moved quite quickly. It has become a priority issue in the United States.I wish to acknowledge the work that is being done in the US by the undocumented Irish, who have contributed enormously to the economic and social life of that country. One needs to visit the US to understand that valuable contribution. I went to New York four weeks ago to attend a function organised by the Sligo people's association there. The House should publicly thank the great county organisations in the US, which do some great work to support and assist the undocumented Irish. Some 450 people attended the Sligo association's function in New York, which was organised in aid of a project in my home town of Ballymote, County Sligo. The commitment of the association, which provides great assistance to those who need it, deserves to be recorded. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is familiar with the work of the Irish association in Chicago, which is headed up by a Sligo man, Mr. John Gurhy. Representatives of the association came to Galway last spring to present a cheque for €120,000, all of which was raised in Chicago, to be used to purchase medical equipment for Galway University Hospital. I am pleased to reflect on the great work that is done by such associations for Irish communities in various cities throughout the US.I pay tribute to the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, including Senators Ryan and Mooney, who have done a substantial amount of work to highlight this issue. Senator Mooney has always been to the fore in raising issues which affect Irish people living in places such as England and the US. I hope that the work of the joint committee will help to improve the circumstances of such people.I was visited last Sunday week by a woman whose son has been living in the US for four years. Her son and his wife have a two year old child. Her husband is very ill and has, at most, six months to live. It is sad that her son cannot return to Ireland to see his father without being worried about the possibility that he will not be allowed back into the US to be with his wife and child. This awful set of circumstances is having terrible a terrible effect on Irish people in the US and on their families in Ireland. I urge anyone who has any form of influence to do whatever can be done to help such people. I compliment the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs on the work they are doing to alleviate these serious problems.I will conclude by mentioning the support that has been given to the undocumented Irish in the US by Senators Edward Kennedy and John McCain and Representatives James T. Kolbe and Jeff Flake. I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs and all others with influence in this regard to continue the work they are doing.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I thank Senator Scanlon for sharing time and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy.It is unprecedented for both Houses of the Oireachtas to agree to declare their support for legislation that is before the US Houses of Congress. The actions of the Dáil and Seanad reflect the support for this proposal throughout the country. The proposed Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act, which has been sponsored by Senators Edward Kennedy and John McCain, is very worthwhile. It will help to support the estimated 10 million undocumented immigrants in the US. The number of undocumented Irish, about whom we are particularly concerned, is debatable. It does not really matter whether the estimate of 25,000 is more accurate than the estimate of 50,000 — the most important thing is to regulate their status. I will not labour the point that has already been made about the circumstances of such people.I wish to comment on a case that came to my attention not long after I became a Senator. I was contacted at that time by the relatives of three young ladies from County Roscommon who are among the undocumented Irish in the US. The family in question, which was deeply concerned about the circumstances of the three young people, appealed to me to use my influence to help the women. I raised the matter in the Seanad by means of a motion in July 2004. The Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, contacted the Taoiseach, who then discussed the matter with the US President, Mr. Bush, who was very sympathetic.The undocumented Irish in the US with whom I am familiar pay taxes and contribute to that country's economy. I appeal to the approximately 40 million Americans who can trace their ancestry to this country to use their influence at the next US presidential election. If this problem is not resolved, it should become a major issue during that election campaign. When Irish-Americans learn that this motion has received the unanimous support of the Irish Parliament, I hope they will use their significant influence at many levels throughout the US. Such people have traditionally been extremely willing to assist this country, such as, for example in the area of export trade.I remind the House of the important support and assistance this country has given to the US. I refer to the courageous step taken by the Government when it decided to allow the US armed forces to use Shannon Airport. It received a great deal of abuse from many sources when it made that decision but it has maintained its stance. It is also important to consider that thousands of Irish-Americans are serving with the US defence forces in their missions abroad. My nephew, for example, has served in Iraq. Such people are courageous in their defence of the idealism of the United States of America. We can make a good case to the US Administration and the US President, Mr. Bush, that it is payback time. The US owes us a great debt of gratitude for what we have given to that country, just as we owe the US for its help as a friendly country.I commend the Members of the House. including Senators Mooney, Ryan and Bradford, who have been very involved in this issue over many years. The Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, have also been very involved. The current Irish ambassador to the United States, Mr. Noel Fahey, who is a friend of mine since school — we sat beside each other in Roscommon CBS — is highly involved in issues of this nature. The Morrison and Donnelly visa schemes made a great contribution over many years. Mr. Brian Donnelly, who gave his name to the Donnelly visa scheme, has a close connection with south Roscommon. We have great friends in the United States.I hope the motion before the House represents a step in the right direction. The united approach of both Houses of the Oireachtas in supporting the Government will achieve results. The Government and its officials will lead this country's campaign on this issue in the United States. The decisions of this House and the Dáil constitute the putting down of a significant marker. I hope and pray that we will get results. Every time this matter is raised in the Seanad, people in the US contact me to ask whether progress is being made. The undocumented Irish want to know there is hope and a possibility of light at the end of the tunnel. It is tragic that such people cannot return home for weddings, funerals and similar significant events. I hope the problems I have mentioned can be resolved.
#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.It seems that good news is coming down the line for those unfortunate people who find themselves officially undocumented in the United States. I compliment everyone connected with that, including those to whom I referred. I single out the diplomatic service for its contribution. We are all aware of the magnificent service it provides to Irish citizens each day.I have visited the United States every year for over 30 years. During that time I have had the opportunity to meet members of the Irish community in different circumstances and in respect of different activities. I refer, in particular, to those I have met in the context of my activities on behalf of Comhaltas CeoltóiríÉireann, which has 50 chapters throughout North America. One comes to realise that there is a great sense of community among the Irish abroad. It is not as if they are in some way a disparate body of people. That is by no means the case. We have seen this reflected in many ways by Americans, none moreso than President Clinton who made such a magnificent, hands-on contribution to the peace process in the North of Ireland. I would go so far as to say that without President Clinton in office at that time, matters might not be as advances as they stand at present. One of the reasons any US President would become involved in the affairs of this island is because of the huge respect for the Irish community in the US and the contribution they have made to the country of their adoption.The quota system, which was introduced during the Kennedy era, impacted greatly on Ireland. At the time I happened to be in Cleveland, which was a stronghold for Mayo people. It is amazing what becomes a priority but what most worried the Irish there was that they would not have as many GAA players coming out to help the teams in the US.

It gave an indication of the community spirit which existed.To return to the current proposals, some people have put on record the representations they were asked to make. I received a number of representations from counties in Munster, particularly Waterford and Tipperary. One involved the case of a young Irishman who married an American citizen. He was undocumented and when he returned home to visit his family he was not allowed to re-enter the US, although his wife was allowed to do so. She is now in the US and he remains in Ireland. While we have heard of sadder cases, these examples underline that all policies and legislation eventually come down to human interest and human considerations. We must keep that in mind. There has always been a special relationship between Ireland and America. That relationship is one which we could exploit, in the best meaning of the word, at this time. The right steps are now being taken through the contacts being made at legislative level.I salute Senators Kennedy and McCain for the stand they are taking. An underlying courage is evident in their actions in light of the atrocities that occurred on 11 September 2001. As a previous speaker stated, we would be equally cautious if the matter involved this country. We wish the Senators well and compliment all who have been involved in any way in this regard. However, we should not take the passage of the Bill as a given. The 40 million people of Irish extraction and the many organisations in which they are involved must continue to lobby. I hope this can be undertaken in a more official way. For example, there is a well-compiled register of organisations of Irish background in the US. This should be called upon so communications can be sent in a subtle way to ensure these organisations use their clout on the ground. I have often felt that, despite our numbers, we did not always use our political clout in the United States as well as might have been the case. Despite members of the Irish community achieving presidential office, we did not always impact on legislation in the way other ethnic groups did. This is one case in which we need to use those organisations.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I have listened with interest and appreciation to the contributions made by all Senators. The quality of the debate is the best possible indication of the concern which Members have for our undocumented citizens in the United States. I am sure many in this House have received representations from family members in their constituencies about relatives in the US. As a public representative from the west, from where a substantial proportion of the undocumented come, I am acutely aware of the difficulties for those concerned and I have dealt with many cases in the past. The debate also reflects the genuine affection our people feel for the United States of America. This in part is a reflection of the tradition of westward emigration, which saw in the US a home for successive generations of Irish people. This tradition survives to some degree, although we no longer have involuntary emigration.As the Minister stated earlier, the Kennedy-McCain Bill represents a comprehensive and bipartisan approach to reforming the immigration process and to resolving the issue of the undocumented. The issue, of course, is not simply one of numbers. Every individual and family has a story with its own difficulties and heartaches. The draft Bill seeks to address all of these in a sympathetic and humane fashion. The architects, who include not just the two leaders but also members of both parties in the US Congress, are to be warmly commended. It will be extremely encouraging for them to know they have the support and the deep appreciation of this House as they move the Bill forward.As we have, this Bill is only one of a number at present before the US Congress. The others include a significant text introduced last July by Senators Kyl and Cornyn. We welcome all engagement on this political issue and recognise that different approaches are to be expected. One way in which the Kennedy-McCain Bill differs from that tabled by Senators Kyl and Cornyn is that it provides for a path to permanent residency status. This is of critical importance to our community.It is still too early to say how the debate within Congress will develop in the period ahead. What is clear is that the US Administration and Congress have moved the immigration issue significantly up the priority scale and are keen to advance the debate. This is a major step forward. The role of President Bush may well be crucial in determining the final form the legislation will take. The reality is that the total number of the undocumented is estimated to be in the order of 10 million, of whom Irish people are but a small segment. Devising legislation that will address numbers of this magnitude in a sympathetic and comprehensive manner, while also taking into account the security dimension, poses a particular challenge. If I sound a note of caution, it is merely a recognition of the depth of the challenge inherent in this sensitive issue.Senators may rest assured that the Government will continue to work intensively, at direct political level and through active lobbying by the ambassador and the embassy, to achieve the best possible outcome for our undocumented citizens. In the light of this debate we will now be in the enhanced position on Capitol Hill of having the full and enthusiastic backing of this House for the Kennedy-McCain Bill and for a new beginning for our undocumented in the United States.I pay tribute to all of our emigrants in all parts of the world. I have had the honour of meeting and addressing many of our emigrants in all five continents over the years. They are all unofficial ambassadors of this country and have ensured a universal respect for Ireland in all parts of the world. This debate confirms the respect of Senators for these people. We must all continue to support them, when and where necessary, as their concerns, priorities and problems are similar to those of us fortunate enough to have remained on the island of Ireland.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the Clare Street initiative, CSI. I thank Senators for raising this matter in the context of my new initiative and the Government's ongoing commitment to an efficient and sustainable transportation system for Dublin and the greater Dublin area. The issue of transport and mobility management is not only an important and interesting question, but one of day-to-day practical concern to all of us, particularly public representatives debating in the Seanad at the heart of our capital city.There have been obvious and substantial improvements in Irish social and economic life since the 1990s, especially over the past eight years. We have seen increases in population and employment, in the number of houses being built, in car ownership and in personal wealth. All of these changes have a direct impact on our transport needs.I confirm to the House that the Government places a considerable emphasis on ensuring that our transport systems can cope with increasing demands. In particular, the Government's ten year transport investment framework will identify the investment and outline the measures that are required to further develop all elements of national transport infrastructure. This means addressing existing bottlenecks and capacity constraints, enhancing quality, optimising the use of the network and making prudent advance provision for future economic growth.I strongly believe we must develop a new model of co-operation for our capital and in doing so, we need to ensure we are grounded in our thinking. We need to move up the value added chain in our transport delivery. We need to collaborate, co-ordinate and integrate in an intelligent fashion in order to maximise the potential and foster new innovations in the way transport providers operate. We have heard many times about the benefits of reduced traffic congestion, reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improved health and safety, more balanced regional development and social justice. However, we must recognise that Government action alone will not solve all our transport problems.I place on record my commitment to ensuring that a broadly based, consultative and innovative approach is taken to provide an efficient and sustainable transportation infrastructure for the people, communities and social and economic partners of the greater Dublin area. This approach is the starting point for any discussion on the future of transportation in the greater Dublin area. That is the basis on which I pulled the CSI group together and I am delighted I got unanimous support when I put the question to the group for the new charter to be adopted.As Senators will be aware, members of my new initiative, referred to as the Clare Street initiative — the reason for the name is because that is where much of the homework took place — have been drawn together at my request to work together to brainstorm and drive forward innovative and, I emphasise, practical proposals for tackling traffic problems in Dublin. Success against congestion requires the efforts not only of one organisation, it is a problem that must be attacked on a number of fronts. It also requires co-operation between transportation agencies, businesses and the public. Since we are all affected by congestion, it is important we all work together and listen to each other in addressing the congestion problem.The charter, adopted by steering group of the CSI at its meeting in Clontarf Castle on 5 October last, lays down the working framework for the initiative. The participants agreed that the purpose of the CSI will be to progress the effective implementation of traffic management and related measures in the greater Dublin area. The focus of the Clare Street initiative will be on measures which have the capacity to make a material difference, large or small; measures which are capable of delivering rapid results; and measures that might not otherwise attract high priority for implementation.In particular, I want to develop and carry forward projects that will contribute towards more effective traffic management. While it is difficult to predict the future, we will all agree one thing that can be stated with assurance, namely, unless more transport options and solutions are available, future commuters will make longer trips at slower speeds. With this in mind, the CSI will focus on the development of innovative measures that have the capacity to make improvements on the ground quickly.The CSI provides the opportunity for experimentation and small-scale field testing of practical measures, for the transfer of know-how based on best practice and for the implementation of innovative concepts and emerging technologies. Also, it permits the business sector to assist in a practical way by providing relevant expertise and will bring together business and public bodies to work on shared challenges.The CSI is intended to complement and bring added value to the major transport investments under way or planned for the greater Dublin area. It will focus on smaller scale traffic management and related initiatives rather than large scale infrastructural or other capital investment projects. It will also focus on the practical delivery of projects rather than advocating or opposing particular projects. Projects under the CSI will be funded from the resources of implementing agencies, as appropriate, and, where necessary, from my Department.Participation in the CSI is on a personal basis rather than as a representative of any agency, company or interest. Members, only some of whom belong to planning and transportation agencies, do not represent any organisation within the CSI forum. Rather, the participants bring their own views and experience to the table. Each member of the steering group brings a specific dimension of expertise and experience to bear on the remit of the CSI. I would like to record my appreciation of, and thanks to, the members of the steering group who not only met and agreed the new charter in Clontarf Castle on 5 October last but who also worked with me over the past number of months, on a regular basis, to bring this to fruition.The participants are finalising a manageable short list of projects to be taken forward in each of the first two years. Project sponsors for each project have yet to be finalised. It will be the role of the CSI to promote and support the implementation of projects but not in any way to substitute itself for existing agencies or to pre-empt their functions.The CSI charter, adopted and agreed in Clontarf Castle at its inaugural meeting on 5 October last, makes it clear that the initiative will work with existing agencies and within existing governance structures and that it will be the responsibility of the relevant statutory or other agencies to decide whether or not to proceed with projects suggested by the initiative. Once the agency has decided to implement a project, the agency and the project sponsor will provide a brief report identifying how and within what timeframe it is proposed to implement the project.The CSI, through the relevant project sponsor, will monitor progress on projects and there will be a reporting structure on progress to the steering group. Having considered the regular reports of sponsors, the group will decide whether to keep the project on its action list. Clearly, projects will need to be defined in terms of their potential for practical implementation and how they can be judged a success or failure.The model for this initiative is the Inzeller Kreis initiative, jointly established by the mayor of Munich and BMW Company back in 1995. The initiative forged a new partnership between the public and the private sectors in the Munich region. In particular, the Munich initiative brought together representatives of local government and business in Munich to identify and promote the implementation of practical measures to address transportation problems. I hope we can learn lessons from the Munich initiative and other traffic models that Members may believe warrant consideration.However, one is not always obliged to rely on models. We constantly learn more about the basic nature of congestion in terms of its trends, its impacts and what can be done about it. Accordingly, we are open to suggestions and ideas from as many sources and as many people as possible. Members will agree that anecdotal information from the public can often be useful in identifying the current locations and causes of major congestion problems. For this reason, I arranged for some members of the public who are not transport practitioners to give their views to the CSI on transport problems in Dublin and what they believed might be done to solve such problems.For example, at the CSI's recent seminar on 5 October, five members of the public gave their viewpoints on aspects of transportation in Dublin. They were Louis Copeland, the well-known Dublin businessman; Clare Finnegan, a PhD student in the department of civil engineering in Trinity College, Dublin; Basil Goode, a hotelier operating in Dublin; Mary Prizeman, a retail store supervisor and housewife; and Joyce Ring, a full-time housewife.All stakeholders have an interest in solving the congestion problem. Public transport companies are in the business of serving customers in the same manner as any private firm, except that the customers, that is, the public and other businesses, buy efficient and safe travel. The public, elected officials and businesses are more than simply consumers but are also stakeholders. Hence, these consumers should also examine their own decisions and policies to identify changes that can improve quality of life while recognising that transport companies cannot solve the problem by themselves.A total of 37 projects were tabled by members of the CSI in advance of the seminar on 5 October 2005. Workshops were held to consider those projects in detail. I could go into great detail in respect of the work I put into the CSI. I approached a number of people whose presence would be appropriate around the table as well as including five members of the public who, as I mentioned, are not practitioners in the delivery of transport modes. I tried to get the mix right, as I did not want the practitioners to talk to themselves around a table. While one might ask why this has not been done before, I cannot answer such a question. For the first time I brought the relevant personnel together to foster a spirit of co-operation rather than of competition between them. I also wanted the seminar to be meaningful and fruitful, rather than a day in which a discussion would be held but which would require people to come back later to consider projects.In that regard, we circulated pre-prepared templates to the group on which its members could include projects. This was the method used to arrive at the 37 projects. The templates included a number of items in respect of what was involved, the time period for implementation and the costs. In essence, it contained the relevant questions that one would expect in order to make a quick decision. The group then broke into workshops to consider the projects in greater detail. Each workshop subsequently presented its chosen projects to the plenary session whereupon they were considered and a short list of projects was identified. In some cases, individual projects were amalgamated.However, the list of projects has not yet been finalised, as those who have been identified as sponsors of individual projects must confirm their acceptance of such sponsorship. I will clarify what I mean by sponsorship. If a proposal was made, such as putting an incentive in place to use public transport modes outside peak travel time, I thought it would be appropriate for it to have a suitable sponsor with his or her finger on the pulse, who would ensure it would go through the relevant stages and who might be in a position to help it do so.In other words, we have requested people to take on sponsorship of projects to ensure they go through the relevant steps. In certain cases, I await confirmation of people's acceptance of such a sponsorship role.Agencies identified as implementers of individual projects must formally accept responsibility for them before the list of projects can be formally announced. We must ensure the requested agency will be prepared to take on the project. However, given the group of people involved, the amount of effort, time and energy put into the initiative and the manner in which projects have been identified, I do not envisage difficulties from either sponsors or agencies.In conclusion, I should point out that the CSI will not, of itself, solve all the traffic problems of Dublin. In the same way that members of the group will be required to work together to tackle traffic problems in Dublin, we will also look to other organisations to play their part. Success against congestion requires the efforts of more than one organisation and is a problem that must be attacked on a number of fronts. It also requires co-operation between transportation agencies, businesses and the public. Since we are all affected by congestion, it is important we all work together to address the congestion problem.I am confident the future of the CSI is secure as a vital element of planning a sustainable transportation network in the greater Dublin area. I hope my comments have been helpful to the House.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, to the House. Belatedly, I congratulate him on his initiative, in that he is attempting to do something for transport in Dublin. However, the two senior Ministers who preceded him have failed and did little. While the Minister of State is trying to do something about the transport issue in Dublin, he does not hold the purse strings and his hands are tied.The Minister of State's initiative is not the first time that such an initiative has taken place. In 1998, former Deputy John Bruton and Deputy Olivia Mitchell held a conference on transport in Dublin. All the agencies referred to by the Minister of State were present. In 2003, as Fine Gael's spokesperson on transport, Deputy Naughten held another conference on the issue in Citywest at which the various organisations were also present. Several different issues emerged from those conferences.The time for talking is over and done with. Everyone knows what is wrong. One does not need any more conferences to know what is wrong with transport in Dublin and with the congestion occurring on a daily basis in the city. Even the recent by-elections in Meath and Kildare threw up many different plans and remedies to solve Dublin's transport issues. However, it all comes down to funding. We could talk until the cows come home, but unless money is provided and unless the Department of Transport and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, provide finance to put in place various solutions that have been proposed in reports over the last ten years, nothing will happen.As the Minister of State's trip to Germany revealed, very few agencies were involved in the German initiative. Obviously, however, decisions were made and money was made available. The Minister of State has noted that park and ride facilities and other remedies were put in place. The various agencies here seek different things, all of which cost money. The Department of Transport should state that it will put in place park and ride facilities in various areas on the city's outskirts.Opening up railway lines is another issue. For example, the railway service between Dublin and Westport has broken down four times in the past six weeks, which would put anyone off the idea of travelling by train to and from the west. I do not know what the Department of Transport is doing on this matter.When the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, he established strategic policy committees, SPCs. Every local authority had an SPC on transport and I am sure these SPCs have something to say or are they redundant now that the Minister of State has put this initiative in place? The Dublin Regional Authority is also an authority on transport but no comment from it is visible here. The Fine Gael position on the Dublin transportation issue is one the Minister of State should take up and run with.

I read through the list of agencies submitted by the Minister of State but how can 21 different agencies run the city's transportation system? After all the discussions that have taken place we know what is wrong but decisions must be taken. The Dublin transport initiative was put forward by Deputy Naughten when he was the Fine Gael spokesperson on transport and the necessity to establish a Dublin transport authority remains our position.On traffic management, Dublin needs a traffic corps. We have all witnessed the transport system working quite well during busy rush hours at Christmas when a traffic corps is in place around the city. Why is this so? Why can it not work on a daily basis? These moves would require money and it is only a matter of investing the money in the projects. The Minister of State has suggested many fine ideas but unless money is invested in many of them, the Government will hopefully be on its way out in 12 months time.

These are basics that will require money. When the recent Meath by-election was contested people sought a train service from Navan to Drogheda and Dublin. This would require funding but would relieve much entry traffic and traffic on the roads and streets of Dublin. Many other people were disturbed by the Taoiseach's remarks concerning supertrucks. He said that people who want to do business in this country must conform to our modes of transport.

People have spoken about abolishing the groceries order to reduce the cost of goods in Ireland. Transport is a significant issue here. We are on Europe's periphery and getting goods to and from the market is very expensive. The Government is split on the supertruck issue. The PDs have one position while Fianna Fáil has another. However, if supertrucks are not allowed in Ireland, I can foresee a situation of trucks with trailers developing, a combination that will be much more dangerous on Dublin's streets than the supertruck. This is an area we should revisit and have a reasoned debate on. The Taoiseach's comments were not helpful in this regard.

The Government knows what is required better than the people who were at that meeting. Decisions on funding need to be made urgently. John Bruton knew in 1998 what was required. I am sure the Department of Transport knows exactly what is needed, as we all do. We have a deficit of funding in the city for park and ride facilities, railway stations, the opening of railway lines to the likes of Navan and so forth. From our point of view, the remedy would be a Dublin transport authority and traffic management or a traffic corps for the city.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on the Government's latest effort to resolve what is a very serious issue in Dublin city. The Minister of State has taken a fresh and detailed approach to the issue and carried out a considerable amount of work behind the scenes before launching the initiative. It is refreshing to know that, when he held the meeting, he was in a position to move on a significant number of the issues and gauge early winds on this initiative, which is critically important. His approach allows for the possibility of moving smaller individual projects ahead at a much faster rate rather than depending on the big bang or large project approach, which can often lose the interest or enthusiasm of people involved. However, the Minister of State is dividing the initiative into 34 or 36 different elements and there is an opportunity to win on a number of levels. There is also the opportunity to spread the elements over different sponsor groups and ensure they are finalised.It is important to examine the problem in the city on a street by street basis to ensure best use of financial and infrastructural resources. By this stage, infrastructural resource means the width of streets, parking availability, proximity to public transport whether it is bus, Luas or train, and trying to put all of it together in a way that maps the needs of the people who use the city on a daily basis. While large scale projects such as the port tunnel, Luas, the extension of DART services, the upgrade of the intercity trains and the extension of commuter train services are excellent in terms of what they deliver, they tend to examine matters on a macro level. Now, the Minister of State is examining the facilities and resources present and ensuring we are sweating the asset, as the old adage goes, to its greatest possible use. It is finite in terms of how far it can be taken and the extent to which improvements can be made but the Minister of State is taking the right approach.I disagree with Senator Paddy Burke that this issue is all about money and we may one day debate how the Opposition would raise the money he believes is needed, be it via increased taxes or whatever. How we use and manage our resources is what we should concentrate on and I am sure the Minister of State's group will do so.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	153	There is an opportunity for experimentation in some of the small scale projects and testing out new ideas, some of which would come from other countries. We are not leaders in terms of city planning and city transport planning and there is much to be learned, as the Minister of State knows. I know the Oireachtas transport committee continues to do this through visits to cities that are ahead of the curve on this issue. There is an opportunity to use new technologies. I saw a recent example of new technology in my own county on the bridge at Killaloe on the border between counties Clare and Tipperary — many Members know of it. For years, trucks became caught on the bridge because of its width and ended up stalling traffic. A very sophisticated traffic light management system is being installed. It is only an interim solution and we would obviously like to see the bridge widened or a new bridge constructed, which has been proposed. The latest technologies in traffic lights systems can greatly alleviate current problems and ensure that there is a greater movement of traffic and that unnecessary delays, which are associated with older technologies, are avoided.It is critically important for the Minister for State to examine integrated transport systems in other countries. This needs to be examined in terms of the entire public transport network and ensuring that integration is present. There are many examples of this around Europe.Education is also a vital component of solutions for the future. The ESB has taught the public about and promoted the idea of conservation and the efficient use of electricity for many years. The ESB suggests that electricity is a finite resource in terms of our ability to generate it. We could also use the same educational approach in terms of the conservation of the use of our road network. When it gets to the current level of congestion in our cities, we must educate people. The Minister of State already spoke about some of these initiatives regarding when people use roads and possibly encouraging people to use them at off-peak times for non-essential travel.The Minister of State's role in dealing with congestion in the greater Dublin area is very worthy and needs to be supported. However, congestion occurs in regional cities and towns, which is also worth looking at. I hope the Government continues to address this issue in the future. It has done so in County Clare with the Ennis bypass and similar developments have occurred in County Sligo and other areas and we wish to see these continue. The tunnel being constructed under the River Shannon that will connect counties Limerick and Clare will be important and immensely beneficial to the people in these two counties and the future growth of Shannon Airport when it comes into play. Hopefully, this will help to overcome some of the drop in passenger numbers about which we are concerned which will result from the proposed changes in the Ireland-US bilateral agreement. I wish to put on record the concern felt by people in County Clare about reports that the Department of Transport is actively pursuing a policy of ending the current dual gateway policy with the US. It appears that this policy is being driven by a desire to facilitate Aer Lingus's expansion, which will create a very difficult trading environment for Shannon Airport. This again tends to centralise services on the east coast, which is unhelpful and unnecessary given the growth of the east coast and traffic congestion there. If we could continue with Government policies that deliver balanced regional development and an infrastructure outside Dublin, it may also help overcome some of the congestion in Dublin. The tell-tale signs are already there.The Shannon Airport Authority is promoting a policy of outsourcing to reduce its costs and is claiming that it is forced to do this. While cost reduction is essential for the future viability of any project or operation, outsourcing can only lead to the creation of yellow pack jobs which will reduce the quality of life and social circumstances of those employed by the airport and those living in the region. Why is this being done? I suppose the reason is to boost the profits of Ryanair, which will hold Shannon Airport to ransom if it becomes the dominant player — I have no doubt it will become the dominant player if the dual gateway policy is dropped. These are the kinds of measures that go over and above what the Minister of State spoke about in terms of alleviating traffic congestion on the east coast, particularly in Dublin. Continuing to promote balanced regional development and the growth of centres in line with the national spatial strategy will also have an effect and help alleviate the problem. This situation is another example of corporate greed, which seeks through outsourcing to increase profits by forcing workers to take less pay for doing more work. We have witnessed a similar situation with Irish Ferries.The Government needs to examine in other areas how the economic sectors are managed to ensure that a spread of population and economic growth will also help to alleviate some of the problems that have bedevilled Dublin in terms of the growth in the numbers of people living and working there and increased congestion, which is now reaching unacceptable levels. This initiative, which goes into the minute detail of the issue, is very welcome but there is a wider solution which we have known about for some time. It is a way of dealing with the west of Ireland and what the Government has already begun through decentralisation, which will also be very beneficial in the future and help redress the balance and address the congestion issues in Dublin and on the east coast.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Frank Fahey, to the House. I note that the Minister of State at the Depart-ment of Transport, Deputy Callely, was forced to leave this House temporarily to address another transport matter in Dáil Éireann but has indicated that he will return and address as many of the points as he can, even those raised during his absence.I welcome this imaginative initiative. I understand the competition that exists between the different political parties with regard to initiatives but I think this initiative is slightly different. I like the fact that it includes the small person, anecdotal evidence and people's actual driving experience. When I look at the management of traffic in Dublin, I wonder sometimes if any of the people responsible for it actually drive around the city. The Minister of State has invited anecdotal evidence so I will talk about my experience of driving into Dublin from County Wicklow because it was illustrative of certain problems we all confront.It would be useful if the Minister of State came in at this point because the initiative has not taken a final shape. He is giving us an idea of what is happening, the participants and the kind of programme he envisages but we still have the opportunity to affect it through debate in this House, which is a very useful and productive political exercise, and I look forward to the Minister of State's return to the House. This initiative has been widely welcomed. I received an e-mail from Dr. Margaret O'Mahony, who is head of the department of civil and structural engineering at Trinity College, Dublin, and who was involved in the initiative. She wrote that she welcomed the initiative quite strongly because she regards it as the start of a process to examine and implement strategies of relatively low cost. She wrote that the focus of the initiative is at transport user level, both for road and public transport users. She explains in further detail why she thinks the initiative is particularly useful.In his speech, the Minister of State spoke about his visit to Munich in Germany, which I would be interested in learning more about. I understand the Minister of State was told by Dr. Manfred Rothkopf of the Munich and Upper Bavaria Chamber of Commerce and Industry that ten years ago, the traffic congestion in Munich was at the same level it is currently in Dublin yet the city managed to overcome it. The principle axis of this recovery, although it is not stated, was public transport and an underground metro system. The one thing that the Minister of State did not mention was a solid commitment to a metro system, which is the only measure that will resolve Dublin's traffic problems. It is inexcusable that we have not supported the Minister of State because I know he is a favour of a metro; it is obvious when one reads the newspapers. This Government should behave imaginatively and endorse the metro. It is not possible to say today as people did ten, 15 or 20 years that there is no money for a metro when Ireland is dripping with money. The money that was wasted on computer systems could have been used on a metro. Over €1 billion in unanticipated tax revenues is a nice windfall that could be used on a metro and would be very cost-beneficial. We would get a good return from our investment.The Minister of State seemed to invite anecdotal evidence so I will share the experience I had today. I travelled from County Wicklow and I do not know how, but I managed to get on the M50. I had a remarkably smooth journey, and it was absolutely terrific. It was the type of experience one would imagine on an autobahn in Germany until I reached the canal where there were roadworks. One then shared the road with the Luas and traffic was reduced to one lane. I turned across in Goldenbridge and was in a queue for 15 minutes because the traffic was inappropriately managed. Almost every driver except me wanted to turn right but there was no feeder light to allow them to do so. Every time the traffic light changed, only one car, if any, managed to escape. That was unnecessary congestion.My temper was not improved when I diverted and arrived at the top of Eccles Street to find the Mater Hospital disgorging what I assume were rural visitors, and it was impossible to move. I was completely stuck. There was no attempt to manage the situation of all of these people who naturally want to visit their relatives in hospital. This gummed up the traffic and there was no movement whatsoever. An imaginative solution is required for this, perhaps a lollypop person, I do not know. In Parnell Street an unusual measure has been taken, whereby a commercial company has been facilitated with its own traffic light. The Ilac Centre has a traffic light all to itself. We must examine all of these matters.The issue of cycle lanes was not referred to in the Minister of State's speech and is one we should examine. Earlier we discussed the tragic situation in Donegal where a number of young people were killed. I did not agree with the analysis of my colleague who mentioned heavy goods vehicles. That is not relevant. All of these weekend accidents are similar and involve quite a large number of young people in one vehicle, in the early hours of Sunday morning, travelling home from a social event. Those are the common factors. No heavy goods vehicle was involved.A tremendous increase in fatalities has occurred. Up to 11 a.m. today, 275 collisions and 303 deaths had occurred this year. I will not analyse these figures in detail because it is not directly relevant to this evening's debate. However, only 260 collisions and 295 deaths occurred during all of 2004. We still have a few months left in 2005 and we have already surpassed that. I introduce this point because of the notion of safety. I used to cycle quite a lot but I would be terrified to do so now. It is impossible because of SUVs, which is another issue to be examined. As a result of research done by Trinity College, we know they are more dangerous than other vehicles. A pedestrian hit by an SUV is twice as likely to be killed. There is also the roll-over syndrome that has been unearthed through research in the United States. These vehicles are not merely gas guzzlers, they are dangerous monsters on the road.For this reason, I would have liked to have involved the lobby group representing cyclists in Dublin, the Dublin Cycling Campaign, in the consultations. Perhaps it is not too late to involve it. I know it attempted to contact the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen. Its representatives wrote to the Minister on 1 February 2005, 7 March 2005 and 30 March 2005 to request a meeting but did not even get a reply. On 20 April the group had a letter published in The Irish Times. I also have experience of the fact that sometimes if one wants to get a reply from a politician, one writes to The Irish Times and one receives a quick reply if the letter is published, but one does not always get a reply from the office. This correspondence continued for some time and eventually an e-mail was sent. There seems to be a reluctance to involve the Dublin Cycling Campaign but it should be involved. If we can get more people onto bicycles and out of cars that will certainly help, but only marginally. The main issue is the metro.Another thought has struck me on my experience today. The M50, which is an orbital road, is great. When I got closer to the city I hit the South Circular Road, a previous attempt at a ring road. I am astonished to hear in the Minister of State's speech that the greater Dublin area now includes Kildare, Wicklow and Meath.

The problem is that we will build orbital roads further and further out instead of building the one thing that will solve the traffic problem, which is the metro. We all know this and I applaud the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, for sticking to his guns.I will make some final points. I understand the Minister of State is considering all types of imaginative solutions, such as allowing people who pool car space and have three or more people in the car to use bus lanes. That costs nothing. It is a small measure but it could be effective. I do not know if the mechanics are possible to enable lights change to green from red late in the evening if there is no traffic coming from the opposite direction. I do not presume the technology must exist or it would not have been mentioned.Mr. Paddy Power — not the bookmaker — has made a rather curious suggestion.

This is an inventor from Galway who has a company called EasyFlow. His idea is to have roads that do not cross, but which merge and demerge. He believes he could institute such a system in Dublin for approximately €3 million. I do not have the technical proficiency or expertise to examine this. Perhaps this type of idea comes from what the Americans call left field and could help to reduce the traffic problems in Dublin. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	159	There is little in this initiative with which anybody could disagree. However, I will go further and state that since I became a public representative in the early 1990s I understood the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, existed and we had to bow and genuflect to it. Nothing would happen in Dublin or the region without having the nod and wink and agreement of the DTO and that is how I understand the situation to be today. On examining what the Minister of State is attempting to challenge and implement, one finds he states it is to promote the greater use of public transport, particularly by improving its performance and increasing its attractiveness.There is a simple initiative that will never get as far as the Clare Street initiative because it will not get through the Department of Finance. I raised the issue of the travel saver pass on numerous occasions in this House. It has been available since 1997 through salary sacrifice but only through employers. I have discussed extending this scheme with the Minister for Finance and the previous incumbent of that office. The most recent letter I received in August told me to get lost and that this would not be done. The reasons given were amazing, and included that if the ticket was made more widely available in the manner I suggested, it would increase the workload of local area offices of the Revenue Commissioners. What rubbish, and I call it rubbish for one reason. A few years ago the bin tax was introduced in Dublin and every householder is entitled to claim tax relief on it. It was not mentioned at the time that it could not be introduced because it would increase the workload of revenue offices. Instead it is primarily targeted at Government offices.Some buses that run into the city centre at peak time are empty while cars come to the city with only one person in them. I challenge anyone here to state how many motorists in the city know a travel saver pass exists. Why is it not widely advertised? The only question the Department of Finance asks of Dublin Bus every year at budget time regarding how many of these tickets were bought is how much God-damn money it has spent advertising it. It does not want it advertised because, as the letter to me stated, it would be a revenue loss to the Department of Finance. The situation is so ridiculous that the Department said if the ticket was more widely available and people could ring up the sales office of Dublin Bus to buy it for themselves, the ticket would be more expensive. It would not be more expensive because if people could buy it for themselves, they would be entitled to tax allowance at the rate of 22% or 40%, while at present employers' RSI of 10% comes on top of that. If people buy the ticket themselves there would not be any employers' RSI so each individual ticket would cost less.In the meantime, buses and cars come to Dublin. Although a travel saver pass is in place the Department of Finance has its hands on the purse strings and will not allow the Department of Transport to go any further with it. This will never be part of the Clare Street initiative because the Minister for Finance has ordained it, yet one of the bold statements of the Clare Street initiative, which I fully endorse and support, promotes greater use of public transport.I have lost count of the number of times Senator Terry and I raised the need for bus stops in our area when we were members of the county council. Four years later some of those bus stops have not yet been provided. They have not been provided because bus stops are dependent on their advertising revenue potential. A bus stop is only provided if Adshel or whatever other company providing the bus stop gets advertising on it. It is not dependent on how many people would use the bus stop; it relates to how many cars are passing by and to how many people would see the advertisement. This is how we are making public transport more attractive.We have spent millions on our bus fleet. One does not often see a bus broken down compared to years ago. The buses provided under the national development plan are good clean ones. A total of 137 buses, carrying approximately 8,000 people, travel between Heuston Station and O'Connell Street between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. every day. The Luas, located 100 yd. from there, carries 2,000 people, yet we all say how fantastic is the Luas. The Railway Safety Order gave it a thoroughfare with which nothing can compete. It can travel straight through to town. Although 8,000 people are carried by buses, the workhorses of Dublin that cover areas no other transport system will, every quality bus corridor, QBC, has to fight its way for every inch it gets, be it from traders or householders along the way.We have invested significant amounts in public transport in terms of our bus fleet yet we have snarled it up by putting in place a QBC system that does not work. We have done nothing imaginative about our QBCs. Last year, €35 million was allocated in the budget for the further development of QBCs and to resolve some of the bottlenecks on existing QBCs. I have not seen one initiative in the Dublin 15 area on QBCs. A QBC in my estate is not monitored by the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO. The DTO monitors this QBC from the middle of the Navan Road. Every car in the country parks on it every morning. The QBC might as well not have been put there at all. On the one hand we put in place expensive traffic calming measures while on the other hand we do not even enforce them. I hope the five lay people referred to by the Minister will be public transport users and that one of them occasionally uses the commuter service from Clonsilla or any of the other areas on the outer regions of Dublin so he or she can see the problems faced by public transport users.While I welcome today's announcement of €350 million for Kildare, it is long overdue and the interconnector is badly needed. If we are to solve Dublin's transport problems, we had better start connecting up what we have already. We must allow buses to travel more freely around the city and provide proper bus stops, bus shelters and a reliable train service which will attract people to use it. The proposed system for Kildare is fantastic but I regret that it will take four years to roll out. It can take up to two years to get a QBC into an area on an existing roadway, although it is basically a white line painted along a road. I foresee major public consultation difficulties because of the objections, representations and so on. Then when we do get QBCs, we do not even police them.Many initiatives must be taken. The Dublin Transportation Office and Dublin City Council boast that the initiatives they have imposed in the city in recent years have resulted in 11% less car traffic between the two canals every day. They boast that they have pushed that car traffic onto the M50. Even though it is claimed that so much has been done, we are now looking at another initiative. As Senator Norris stated, any new initiative must be in the direction of public transport. One small initiative would demonstrate how serious the Department of Finance is in regard to this issue. I do not blame the Department of Transport as its hands are tied even regarding the implementation of the ten-year plan. The Department of Finance will dictate when and how that gets off the starting blocks.The Department of Finance could demonstrate its willingness to allow every person in Dublin to leave his or her car at home and to get a travel saver pass so that he or she could get on the buses which have already been provided. Why would anybody get on a bus when the bus fleet is operating at something like 22% efficiency, travelling at something like 9 km or 13 km per hour? However, we have invested a significant amount of money in buses. I appeal to the Minister to examine the bus and train system and bus shelters so that people might leave their cars at home without getting drenched on the way to work.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	160	When looked at in isolation it is difficult to quibble with the Clare Street initiative. It appears to be getting people together, some of whom have an interest or expertise in transport matters, some of whom do not, and brainstorming to come up with up with little ideas as opposed to big ones. It does not have a budget; it does not have a plan. It does not have authority to carry through what it wants to do. Nonetheless, it is an inoffensive little idea and looked at in isolation I would not have a problem with it. The difficulty is that it is impossible to look at this in isolation; one must look at the bigger picture, which is one of incomprehensible stagnation in terms of decision making.One of the first things the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, did when he came into office was to make his Valentine's Day revelations of 14 February last when he prematurely announced the ten-year transport initiative referred to by Senator Morrissey. A couple of days before the Minister was due to make a similar announcement, in his most indiscreet fashion, Deputy Callely, announced a whole range of projects costing no less than €6 billion over the next ten years. The trouble is that the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, did not have any authority to say it, not from his senior Minister, the Department of Finance or anybody else. A couple of days later the Minister, Deputy Cullen, got up on his hind legs in the Dáil and said that the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, was a bit previous, he would soon bring proposals to Government and we would all hear about the ten-year plan a few weeks later at the beginning of March. That was a spat between the Ministers and the Department at the beginning of February. It is now the start of October, eight months later, and we still do not have a ten year plan. Although we are eight years into the Government's tenure we still do not have any plan at all for public transport in Dublin. This applies to small matters and more significant ones. It applies to matters regarding which there is overwhelming consensus and others regarding which there is a real decision to be taken.Let me refer to one of the small matters, namely, integrated ticketing, with which everybody agrees — at least I have not heard of anybody who disagrees with it. I live close to Killester DART station and if I want to go to Heuston Station, I should be able to take the DART at Killester Station and transfer to the Luas using the same ticket. This makes perfect sense. The Leader of this House, when she was Minister for Public Enterprise, announced she would achieve this very shortly after she took up that office in 1997. We heard more or less similar announcements from the Department in the succeeding four years. The then Minister told us she had made progress and had provided funding for a study on how integrated ticketing might be achieved. Ultimately, she told us it could be achieved using a smart card. When she went out of power there was suddenly a hiatus and we did not hear much about the issue for some time. We were then told a slightly different smart card would be used and that a different company might operate the system. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, told us at the end of 2004, shortly after he took up office, that we would have integrated ticketing. He said it was a wonderful idea which he had just conceived and that it would be in place substantively before the end of 2005. He said the Luas would introduce it earlier this year — it did something approximating it — and that Dublin Bus would introduce it towards the end of 2005. I do not know whether this is still the plan but I would love to know. No doubt the Minister of State will be in the House shortly, at which time he will tell us.I am using integrated ticketing simply as an example of the paralysis affecting decision making and the incapacity to get anything done where there is a consensus regarding what should be done and where it is ascertained that it will not cost a fortune. We seem to be quite incapable of doing anything in such circumstances. I will be very interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say on this issue.The Minister of State claims to have been inspired by the Munich experience when introducing the Clare Street initiative. This is well and good; I am sure he was. Munich is a city with which I happen to be familiar because I was one of the legion of Irish students who went there during the 1980s to study for the summer. I did so several times and therefore know something about how traffic initiatives developed there over the years. The circumstances that now obtain are such almost exclusively because of public transport, as Senator Morrissey rightly pointed out. When I first visited Munich in 1980, there were two U-Bahn lines, the U3 and U6 if my memory serves me well. There are now eight or ten. Over the succeeding quarter of a century, the city has built up a full structure of U-Bahn lines which serve virtually everybody, not only those living in the inner city but also those in the outer suburbs. This was done at a relatively reasonable cost.Members of the Joint Committee on Transport visited Madrid a couple of years ago and it related a similar experience. It seems to be well within the ken and capacity of cities much the same size as Dublin to transform their public transport systems and put in place a comprehensive metro. However, we seem to be incapable of even making a decision in this regard. This is not to say we have not made a decision because the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke, said in 2000 that the Government was committed to providing a metro. Pretty much every reply to every parliamentary question on the issue since then involves a one-line answer by the relevant Minister to the effect that the Government is committed, under the programme for Government, to a metro for Dublin. We are not sure it is.Iarnród Éireann produced plans in July 2004 which might sideline the metro. The Government seems to be totally incapable of making a decision. Will the Minister of State say what happened to the Iarnród Éireann plans of 2004, which included the plan for the interconnection between Heuston Station and Spencer Dock and the plan for the metro to Dublin Airport? These plans seem to have disappeared into some vast black hole in the Department of Transport which seems to sap the energy and initiative of all Ministers or anybody who gets involved with that Department.I want to mention one or two issues that arose very briefly during the course of the discussion. Senator Paddy Burke mentioned supertrucks. I do not agree with him thereon but he reminded me of another issue on which we require a decision. The Government decided correctly not to increase the height of Dublin Port tunnel so as not to encourage supertrucks. They are just too big, they wreck our roads, they guzzle gas and petrol and their emissions are too high. I would have no problem if they disappeared. However, the Minister and his predecessors have been telling us for some years that they are to introduce regulations for heavy goods vehicles but they have not done so. There is a suspicion that the industry somehow "got to" the Department or Minister. Surely there can be no other good reason it should take so long to produce regulations. What is the position on the regulations? The Minister should bring some sort of certainty to the industry because, in fairness to it, it deserves it.A plethora of different policies on buses has emerged from the Department in recent years. The policy which appears to have been favoured by the former Minister at the Department of Transport, Deputy Brennan, was bizarre in the extreme. He wanted to take a percentage of the fleet of Dublin Bus — probably a quarter — and franchise it out without providing for any increase in capacity within the city. He wanted to do so on the basis of some strange notion of competition, which I presume is based on the ideology he shares with Senator Morrissey. I do not know the current position and I presume the citizens of Dublin and the providers of public transport, including Dublin Bus, do not know either.The truth is — this is good news — that the Dublin Bus fleet has improved considerably in recent years in terms of its reliability, the standard of provision and the comfort of the buses. Usage is increasing also, which is partly due to the creation of the quality bus corridors. I hope we have decided not to interfere with Dublin Bus. I have no problem with franchising out new routes, nor do I have a problem with competition on existing routes given that it operates in a planned and organised way, but the notion of simply franchising out part of the network and taking it from Dublin Bus in a way that would not increase capacity was always daft. The Minister of State should confirm that this notion is dead and buried.I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Calelly, well with the Clare Street initiative. It seems his big ideas of Valentine's Day have given way to a series of small ideas, none of which he is willing to share with us today. I guess the initiative cannot do any harm but I, for one, am not holding my breath.

I confess that when the motion on the Clare Street initiative and traffic calming measures appeared on the Order Paper for today, I did not know what it was about. I therefore had to do some research. Having done so, I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, on his initiative.I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, chaired a meeting on 5 October last in Clontarf Castle. The participants have already been mentioned by him and other speakers and I do not intend to mention them again. They agreed to establish what has become known as the Clare Street initiative. They agreed its purpose will be to progress the effective implementation of traffic management and related measures in the greater Dublin area. This area, as outlined by the Minister of State in his speech, includes all of Dublin city and county and counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.The focus of the initiative will be on measures that will have the capacity to make a material difference, large or small, measures capable of delivering rapid results, and measures which might not otherwise attract high priority for implementation. The initiative will also provide the opportunity for experimentation and small-scale field testing of practical measures, the transfer of know-how based on best practice and the implementation of innovative concepts and emerging technologies.I must confess I do not know Dublin well. I basically know how to get into it and out of it. The time that takes depends on the time one is coming in or going out. I am aware of many transport-related programmes conceived by the Government, some of which are completed and some of which are soon to be completed. The Luas, for instance, is an excellent system and has been a great success in transporting people throughout the city. The quality bus corridors, which have been mentioned by a number of speakers, are a great success, although my colleague Senator Morrissey seems to have a difficulty with the one that operates in his area. Perhaps, as a public representative, he should deal with that and not bring it to the House. People who have experience of these quality bus corridors argue that they should be expanded. I welcome the fact that €35 million has been allocated this year for the expansion of the quality bus corridors.The DART system has doubled its number of carriages and this is to be welcomed. I understand, from people who use the DART, that it has become very effective. It is now a nicer form of transport for people to take in the mornings and evenings. I welcome today's announcement by Irish Rail that it is to invest €250 million on the Kildare line. However, I regret that it will take up to four years before that project is completed. Nonetheless, we have to go through the democratic process as regards proposed projects. I would also like to see this project expanded further down the line towards Mullingar, before long.I understand that the Dublin Port tunnel will soon be finished. I note that Senator Paddy Burke and a number of other speakers have expressed concern over supertrucks not being able to use the port tunnel. I do not know enough about this to comment. However, I trust the Taoiseach, and if he says there is no need for them, then that is the position. I understand that an outer ring road is being planned for Dublin and will be included in the NRA's ten-year plan, which is to be published shortly.My part of the country contributes to some of the congestion in the capital. The construction of the M3 is vitally important for people living in Cavan and Meath, commuting from towns such as Virginia, Kells and Dunshaughlin. More than 3,000 people commute daily from Cavan alone, not to mention the other towns on the way. It is vitally important that this is completed without delay. I welcome that the Minister has given permission for the archaeological digs which so far have unearthed nothing of significance, I understand. In this regard I want to comment on the proposal for a park-and-ride system. Any vehicle travelling from Cavan to Dublin on the new M3 will have to pay two tolls. There is no difficulty with that. However, there are proposals for the provision of a park-and-ride facility for up to 1,500 cars on the outskirts of Dunshaughlin. That will also have to be paid for by the people who use it. Anyone using the road and paying tolls should not have to pay to use that facility. I urge the Minister to examine this.I would urge the Minister and the Government to go full speed ahead with the rail link to Clonee and on to Navan. I am a realist and do not expect this within the next few years, but perhaps the NRA's next ten-year plan might mention that the line could perhaps go as far as Cavan. Cavan is an expanding town——

Cavan and Monaghan were identified in the national spatial strategy as hub towns. We very much welcome that, but these were the only two of the nine mentioned that have no rail links. That is worth bearing in mind.I welcome the Clare Street initiative, which makes interesting reading. I commend the Minister of State on putting his team together and I wish them well.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Like Senator Wilson, I too, thought that the Clare Street initiative and traffic calming measures was about putting ramps on Clare Street, until my colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, told me what it was really about.I cannot compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, on what is proposed here. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, is very welcome. Coming from Cork as he does, I am sure he understands the problems we have in Dublin and does not envy us. I want to quote the Minister of State, Deputy Callely:I want to place on the record my commitment to ensuring that a broadly based, consultative and innovative approach is taken to provide an efficient and sustainable transportation infrastructure for the people, communities, social and economic partners of the greater Dublin area.That is very good. We heard something along those lines on the first day the Government was formed. I want, however, to bring the next sentence to the House's attention: "I believe that this approach is the starting point for any discussion on the future of transportation in the greater Dublin area."I am expected to welcome the Clare Street initiative but there is no need for this initiative. I feel sorry for the people the Minister of State has invited to discuss this with him and I compliment them on giving of their time to do so. Do they realise that the plan is there already in the form of the Dublin Transportation Office's transport strategy A Platform for Change — 2000 to 2016? It just has to be implemented. This initiative has no teeth, whatsoever. It is an effort by the Minister of State to reinvent himself, or to boost his ego, and to deflect attention away from the work that has not been done by his Department.The failure to do this work has resulted in the congestion and the gridlock to be seen in Dublin on a daily basis. The Minister of State wants to try to solve the congestion in Dublin and this is the starting point. Does the Minister of State believe we came down in the last shower? Does he believe the people of Dublin will thank him for this initiative? I think not, and it is foolish to consider that this will deceive the people. We knew what needed to be done years ago, as Senator Morrissey has outlined. It is absurd to be talking of a ten-year plan which still has to be published. I have heard Senator Morrissey many times, and I support him in much of what he has said. Where is the integrated ticketing? Where is the electronic real-time bus information system? It would not be of great assistance, indeed, to people at the bus stops, apart from telling them that the bus will not be along for another 20 minutes or so. Where are the car parks at the railway stations? Where are the park-and-ride facilities we talked about years ago? In the Fingal county development plan, park-and-ride facilities have been included for years and not one has been provided. It would really impact on congestion in Dublin if people on the outskirts could be transported to the city centre by buses in the way the Luas is now transporting people from the Red Cow roundabout. There is not a single park-and-ride facility, certainly in the Fingal area.As regards rail services, I acknowledge some improvements have been made on the Connolly-Maynooth line. This cannot be further improved, however, because of lack of capacity at Connolly station. An area of Dublin 15 which has a population approaching 100,000 is gridlocked due to lack of investment in public transport. There are some quality bus corridors over short distances. The one referred by Senator Morrissey is perhaps 100 yd. long before reaching a bottleneck from which point the buses cannot proceed any further. The same applies to most bus corridors in Dublin. While I support them and agree they help users to reach their destination a little quicker, buses still crawl into town.An Bord Pleanála consistently informs us that it approves planning applications on the basis of the availability of public transport. It may, for example, grant permission for development if a bus corridor is located nearby. Dublin has been over-developed without the provision of an appropriate level of infrastructure. The city needs development because people want to live in it but this development must be matched by infrastructure. While the Dublin Port tunnel will make a major difference on the quays, it will create chaos on the M50, already the largest car park in the country.The Minister of State did not mention the proposal to introduce a dedicated traffic corps. Where is this simple initiative? Why has it not been implemented? A dedicated traffic corps should be introduced immediately but its members should not be gardaí. The Garda should be deployed to prevent crime on the street not to direct traffic.The document, A Platform for Change, outlines what needs to be done in Dublin. I cannot understand how the Minister of State has the brass neck to come into the House and inform Senators that this report is the starting point for discussion on transportation in Dublin. The parties in Government have been in power for almost eight years. What have they delivered? This Government has done nothing but increase congestion and gridlock in Dublin, yet the House is still discussing A Platform for Change.

I am delighted he is as enthusiastic about this initiative as about previous measures with which he has been involved. If anybody has knowledge of the effect of traffic on local areas, it is the Minister of State. The manner in which the initiative has been compiled and the steering group involved in its delivery will ensure participation is comprehensive and the proposals remain realistic and achievable.Of all the issues exercising people in my area, traffic probably ranks third on the list after health and crime. Transport issues, whether disc parking, cycle and bus lanes or speed ramps, affect the lives of everyone, from schoolchildren to pensioners. We must all use our transport infrastructure, whether to take a bus or travel by bike, on foot or in a car. Transport, therefore, has a profound impact on people's daily lives and this initiative, which proposes to micro-manage issues and address specific problems, will help to alleviate some of our transport problems.In my area of Dublin, ramps, speeding, parking for residents and other transport issues create problems. For example, the significant increase in the number of small and large apartment complexes presents difficulties. In the 1980s and 1990s, when speed ramps were first introduced as a traffic calming measure, their purpose was to combat the major joyriding problem experienced in certain areas of the city. These ramps are now being used as a traffic calming measure to reduce speed but have become redundant because the sheer volume of traffic means one can no longer speed on the roads.Senator Morrissey referred to the Dublin Transportation Office. I recall the widespread consultation process involving the public, business, local authorities and other relevant bodies which took place prior to the establishment of the office. Published in the early 1990s, its final report resulted in the Dublin transport initiative which produced a number of excellent concrete recommendations, including the introduction of bus and cycle lanes, the construction of a light rail system and improved public transport. However, some of the more important recommendations, such as the introduction of park and ride facilities and the construction of a metro, have not been implemented.I fundamentally disagreed with the policy of excluding as much car traffic as possible from the city centre because the infrastructure required to support this approach was not provided. This policy decision, which is still in effect, was applied at the expense of areas adjacent to the city centre. It is obvious it has not worked because traffic is still a major problem for anyone seeking to cross the city. No steps were taken to link this wider approach with the policies of Dublin City Council, which continued to grant permission for the development of large car parks and apartment complexes in the city centre. The requirement that every apartment development have a certain ratio of car parking spaces to apartments, for example, did not link in to the policy of trying to exclude cars from the city centre.While nobody can deny the considerable investment and improvement in public transport in recent years, these positive developments must be supported by other measures. The Luas is an example of an approach which works. I recall that the residents of certain areas in my constituency fought tooth and nail against proposals to build a light rail system. Public representatives for these areas did their constituents a major disservice in opposing Luas and causing the planned route to be changed to avoid Mount Brown and Inchicore. Driving through these areas the other day, I noted that businesses are folding or moving elsewhere.The Clare Street initiative focuses on smaller-scale traffic management. Steps which may not seem significant in the overall context could have profound effects at local level. In recent months, for example, changes to two of the main arteries from the northside into the city centre, the Howth and Malahide roads, which have involved channelling traffic into one lane, have created major problems where there had been none previously. These problems are the direct result of a policy decision to prevent as many cars as possible from entering the city centre. It may be a small change overall but it has a major impact at local level.While I accept that the introduction of a traffic corps was proposed, one must also consider recent successes such as the imminent opening of the Dublin Port tunnel. Senator Paddy Burke raised the issue of supertrucks. Between 9,000 and 10,000 trucks travel from Dublin Port through East Wall every day. We do not need to supersize them. This is not that big a country. Unfortunately, we cannot cope with these vehicles. I agree with the Taoiseach when he stated we do not need them.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I listened to Senator Morrissey, who tried to explain it. In fairness to him, he made a valiant effort. I would hate to put him on the same level but I think he is as confused as I am about what it might be.The crucial aspect is that the Minister of State told the House earlier that it "will work with existing agencies and within existing governance structures and that it will be the responsibility of the relevant statutory or other agencies to decide whether or not to proceed with projects ...". What is new? The Clare Street initiative is just a new layer on top of what is already there. The Minister of State would be far better off bringing forward the urgent infrastructure Bill, which has been promised for a long time and which could save a great deal of time in other ways.I wish to begin with two anecdotes for the Minister of State. On the northside of Dublin, the N2 comes straight down through Finglas. As the second of the main arteries of Dublin, it arrives at Harte's Corner where it becomes one lane and shares priority with another road coming from Ballymun. The Minister of State might say that next year the M2 will replace the N2 but that will only treble the problem because it will result in a motorway, rather than a national primary route, coming into one lane at Harte's Corner. The difference here is that there is no road off the N2. In the case of many other roads into the city traffic is filtered off in one way or another, going west or east, or south or north. The N2 has only one final destination, Glasnevin. There is no road off it. The N2 is not working.My second anecdote relates to my visit to Auckland, which has a traffic congestion problem. Each day at noon a huge machine, which looks a little like a snow-plough, goes out along the main road into town and moves the median across one lane. Instead of there being three lanes into the city and one lane out, the machine facilitates the reverse.

It is no good to us, however, because the problem at the city end persists. Standing at Harte's Corner, one can see where the problem lies. The traffic coming into the city is not prioritised. Traffic should be prioritised until it reaches some place where it can disperse and that is not happening on the N2. I could give the Minister of State plenty more examples.Earlier Senator Morrissey stated that the people who deal with this should be ones who travel on public transport. It is a fair point. It is difficult to do so. I came into the city by public transport this morning. I live on the N2. First, I had to decide what to do with my car because the bus passes a mile and a half from my house and there is no park and ride facility. I said this to the Minister of State a year and a half ago and he agreed one would be a good idea. He has done nothing. There are acres of space between the N2, the M50 and the new M2.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	180	There are acres of space in Senator Morrissey's new constituency, where the Minister of State could also help him out by putting in a park and ride facility at the airport end.There is the proposal, which also relates to Senator Morrissey's constituency, to extend the Metro to Swords, where one could provide a generous sized park and ride facility. Part of the problem with the airport is the result of cars going into it and that will be exacerbated next year when the port tunnel opens because all the trucks will go back up the M50. That will add to the difficulty.We need what the Taoiseach suggested eight or nine months ago, an outer ring road. I also agree with him on this. Senator Morrissey also mentioned this. Why not just do it? It is clear that we need it. It is only a matter of where to route it, from Drogheda through Slane to Naas, or wherever. It is merely a matter of taking a look at the map. I could find four different places where it might go. There is plenty of land out there. One need only start buying it up and doing it. Why are we not moving on this? An outer ring road would take pressure off the M50 in a way that nothing else can, so that traffic travelling routes such as Cork to Belfast, Limerick to Belfast and Galway to Cork could turn off the Dublin road a long way outside the city. That is what we need to do.There should be a park and ride facility at all of the main arteries into the city. There is none on the northside. There is none on the Blanchardstown road, there is none on the Navan Road, there is none on the Ashbourne Road and there is none on the airport road. Perhaps there is one in the Minister of State's constituency — I am not familiar with the coast road. I do not know of any park and ride facility on the Dublin northside.How can it work? People manage through grace and favour. Many of the public houses on the northside will allow people park their cars there before flagging down a bus in the morning but that will not last much longer. It boils down to the fact that if there is a swift efficient service, people will use it. Such a service is not provided. Many of the problems are not as huge as we are making them out to be. Traffic priority in some places is the issue. Park and ride would be a significant issue, as would ensuring a bus service runs continually up until midnight.The other issue involves the trains. I welcome this morning's proposal about Kildare. I spoke here in the presence of a Minister in a debate on the national development plan before it was published some seven years ago and we were told the Navan line would be open in no time. They have not even put a spade in the ground. These are the kinds of difficulties we need to look at. I would be delighted to be proven wrong on it but, as far as I know, there has been no work on it. I am sure Senator Wilson would be happy enough, in that we could then talk about extending it from Navan to Cavan. It all is there and it all can be done. There is no reason we cannot look at these matters.I wholeheartedly agree with the points Senator Kitt made last Thursday, and other points made over the past week or so, about the need to put in place the western corridor. That relates to traffic outside of Dublin and hardly relates to the Clare Street Initiative. We do not know what the Clare Street Initiative is about. Perhaps the Minister of State might look upon me as a fourth class primary school child and explain in simple terms what it will do, who will do it, who will pay for it and how it will be done.

I again refer to the significant and unprecedented investment that has been made and continues to be made in transport infrastructure.Senator Paddy Burke asked if funding was available for the Clare Street initiative. I am pleased to say it is. Many of the agencies have their funding and are satisfied that they will be able to accommodate some of the requests relating to the CSI.The idea of CSI is that it is intended to complement and bring added value to the major transport investments that are currently under way or planned for the greater Dublin area. The CSI will focus on the smaller scale traffic management and related initiatives rather than the large scale infrastructural or other capital investment projects, on the understanding, of course, that we are doing our ten-year investment plan and we know what that entails.I am delighted to hear Senator Norris endorse my desire to see the metro on the north side of the city, not just as far as Dublin Airport but north of Swords to open that catchment area. I know others in the Chamber want this development, which should include park and ride facilities.The Clare Street initiative has been introduced to develop projects that will contribute towards more effective traffic management in the greater Dublin area. The initiative will specifically focus on the development of measures that have the capacity to deliver results on the ground quickly and, in particular, on the practical delivery of projects. The necessary investment and funding will be available from the Department of Transport, along with investment in other required infrastructural projects. The ten-year transport investment framework is under consideration and I am optimistic that we will be in a position in a matter of weeks to provide the final detail in respect of it.A number of Senators mentioned park and ride facilities. If I had within my control a land bank on a main artery route into the city with an adjacent bus or rail link or if anybody indicated to me that the Department possessed such a land bank, I would dig it with shovel and spade if necessary to put a park and ride facility in place.

#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I have written to every transport provider and local authority more than once asking them to bring forward proposals and plans to this end — Senator Paddy Burke asked about funding in this regard — and indicated that 100% capital funding would be available. We all know the benefits of park and ride facilities and I support Senator O'Toole's view on them. I would like to see them in place. I have given the DTO a commitment with regard to five projects it has identified in this area. I had a difference of opinion with the DTO when it suggested that park and ride facilities should only be rail based. I do not support that view. We should explore the provision of park and ride facilities for all of our main arteries.On the issue of integrated ticketing and ticket sales, as late as yesterday it was brought to my attention that a person buying a ticket in, for example, Cork to travel to Dublin, might believe it was necessary to purchase another ticket when he or she got off the train at Heuston. That person can purchase a ticket in Cork from the Iarnród Éireann desk that will take them to the city centre, with a choice of whether to travel by bus or Luas, for an extra 90 cent. We need to get the message across to people that there are smart cards available. The CSI can help develop this awareness.I agree that infrastructural projects alone are not the solution to the congestion in Dublin. One innovation that has been of assistance in tackling congestion is the QBC initiative, which has been tremendously successful. In previous years the funding available for developing and extending QBCs went from €17 million to €23 million and, prior to my arrival in the Department, to €29 million. I am pleased to indicate that funding of €40 million is available for QBCs in Dublin this year. I would like to roll out the QBC network throughout the city.We have heard various stories about supertrucks and the need to address the related issues of delivery and competitiveness. We did not, of course, hear the arguments about environmental costs, safety implications and damage to road infrastructure, etc. We need to make a decision on supertrucks. The new port tunnel, with an operational height of 4.65 m, will open shortly and many of our other road and rail bridges have operational heights of approximately 4.2 m. I understand the European norm is 4 m. The sooner we make the necessary decision on the size of supertrucks allowed use our network, the better. As the decision rests with me, I intend entering discussion with the representative bodies as soon as possible and coming to a satisfactory conclusion on the issue.I would like to have more time available to go into greater detail on the Clare Street initiative. This is a genuine attempt, through my limited powers as a Minister of State, to recognise the authorities that exist with their own autonomy to deliver. I am pulling them together to work with them in a spirit of co-operation to try and address the issues in the operation of our transport network and to provide integration through collaboration and co-ordination, something that heretofore was not visible in the operation of the transport network.The CSI has sown an important seed. It has people meeting together in a spirit of co-operation, discussing and evaluating identified projects and being unafraid to talk openly. It has appointed a sponsor to take on the project and recognises that we want a quick solution. We have had the talk and I do not want any more of it. I want action and delivery. The sooner we have it, the better.I thank Senators for their positive reaction to my new initiative. We have had a useful exchange of views. I would like to put on record my appreciation of my Department officials, in particular Tom Ferris, who has taken detailed notes of all that has been said. We have agreed that we will take on board the issues and suggestions raised and bring them to the attention of the group. I hope we can deliver positive results from the work of this new CSI initiative.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I wish to raise the difficulties at St. Eunan's secondary school in Letterkenny, an all-boys secondary school that used to be a boarding school. In particular, I am concerned that the school does not have enough space to accommodate its current enrolment of 800 students. The school's authorities are experiencing major problems in facilitating its teachers and students within the existing school building. I would like the Minister for Education and Science to outline the timeframe within which the school's extension will be completed and to clarify the stage to which the project has progressed. The proactive and hard-working teachers and parents who are involved in the school's new board of management structure want to know where the proposed school extension stands. A meeting was arranged with the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, when such details were sought last February. The board of management was told to collate the school's enrolment figures and to give that information to the Minister. Although the board was very good and did its homework as it had been told to do, it recently found itself in limbo when it was told that the project had been returned to stage one.I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will be the bearer of good news this evening. I hope he will tell me that the project is no longer at stage one, but has been progressed to a further stage. The Minister of State is normally the bearer of good news and I hope tonight will not be any different in that regard. I seek clarification about the current status of the proposed school extension. It is not good enough, from a health and safety perspective, that the school is having such difficulties in seeking to accommodate 800 students. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the progress that has been made in respect of the extension of the school building at St. Eunan's college. I would like him to make clear the stage to which the project has progressed. When will it progress to the next stage?

I am not certain that I will convey to him the good news he is expecting, but I certainly have news for him. I am responding to the Senator on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who wants me to outline the progress being made throughout the country under the schools building and modernisation programme. She has specifically asked me to speak about the current status of the building project at St. Eunan's college in Letterkenny, County Donegal. Perhaps it is not appropriate for me to ask a question on the Adjournment, but I would like to know whether Senator McHugh is a graduate of St. Eunan's college.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The Government has invested in the largest schools building and modernisation programme in the history of the State. The almost €500 million that it will spend on school buildings this year compares favourably to the €70 million spent on school buildings in the year when Senator McHugh's party left office. More than 1,200 schools will benefit as a result of the announcements by the Minister for Education and Science this year under the school buildings and modernisation programme. The works in question range from rewiring and new windows to entire new schools. Not only is the Government investing unprecedented amounts of money in school building and modernisation projects, but it is also accelerating the pace with which projects are delivered. The Government, by devolving more responsibility to schools under the small and rural schools initiative and the summer works scheme, is allowing schools to progress projects at a much faster pace than would be achieved if every small project were micro-managed at a central level. This system ensures that the staff of the Department of Education and Science are free to concentrate on moving large projects through the main building programme as quickly as possible.Generic designs are being used to speed up the design process. Standard designs are used for certain types of school, such as four-teacher schools on greenfield sites, for example. The Minister recently announced a major programme of public private partnerships for schools. This is a further public procurement innovation being used by the Government to deliver top class new school buildings quickly. The modernisation of the facilities in all 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, especially in light of the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area and the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of increasing population. The Government is determined to ensure that every child is educated in a suitable and comfortable environment. The substantial increase in funding for school building projects in recent years is a clear demonstration of its commitment to achieving this goal.I wish to outline the current position in respect of St. Eunan's college in Letterkenny, County Donegal. A full design team has been appointed and the process of architectural design of the school's extension project is progressing. The planned extension, which consists of a total area of 1,450 sq. m., was initially designed to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 750 pupils. The level of enrolment at the school has increased significantly in recent years, however, from 760 pupils in September 2000 to 810 pupils in 2004. In that light, and to ensure that the proposed capital investment will deliver accommodation appropriate to the school's future needs, the school planning section of the Department of Education and Science is reassessing the school's long-term projected enrolment. That process involves an examination of demographic and enrolment trends and the local authority's plans for residential development that could impact on enrolments at St. Eunan's college. The school authority will be consulted as part of this process, which will be completed as quickly as possible to allow the project to progress as planned. The current extension project is at an early stage of architectural planning and a stage one submission — site suitability and site survey with various design solutions — has been received by the Department of Education and Science. When a review of the submission has been completed and a final determination of the school's long-term enrolment status made, officials from the Department will make contact with the school authorities about progressing the project.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	193	The Minister of State has spoken about demographics. It is important to note that Letterkenny, like Derry, has gateway status. Many commentators have said that Letterkenny will have city status at some future time. I do not think demography should be an issue at this stage. Letterkenny is a heaving town that has seen a great deal of development. Whether that development has been done in a planned fashion is a debate for another day. Letterkenny does not have any demographic problems which mean that the level of enrolment does not necessitate the proposed extension. The problem I have raised is that the school authorities and the board of management of St. Eunan's college are unable to facilitate the present student numbers, whatever about increased numbers.I would like to conclude by mentioning some of the investment that has been made at the college. I read last weekend in a local newspaper, Donegal on Sunday, that one of the Deputies for Donegal North-East has welcomed the installation of heaters at St. Eunan’s college. I will reserve my comments about the need for a Government party Member to issue a press release welcoming the purchase of heaters by a school. The real issue faced by St. Eunan’s college is its need for an extension. I would like one of the Government Deputies representing County Donegal to submit a press release saying that the extension in question will be advanced from phase one to phase two as quickly as possible. They should not make any more silly press announcements welcoming heaters.

A detailed exercise has been completed to ascertain the future enrolment trends at St. Eunan's college. The trends will inform the Minister's thoughts on the level of development to be sanctioned. The Minister has indicated that the school authorities will be consulted as part of this process, which will be completed as quickly as possible to allow the project to progress as planned.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House to discuss the important issue of the level of ambulance cover in County Clare. I am particularly concerned about the level of cover in two areas — Scarriff and Shannon. The Minister of State might be aware that the Scarriff catchment area comprises my back yard, in effect. The facility that was developed in the area in 2003 is very good. There is a population of approximately 10,000 in the Scarriff catchment area, which covers 601 sq. km. The two closest ambulance bases are located 35 km away in Ennis and 40 km away in Limerick. The Minister will accept this is a considerable distance and that there is a need for enhanced cover.The current problem concerns staffing. A good ambulance base was built but staff are rostered for just 19 hours per day, with no service from 7 p.m. to midnight. This is a critical period, particularly at weekends, and problems have resulted. There has been consistency in the incidence of accidents in the Scarriff catchment area between 7 p.m. to midnight, when, effectively, no service has been available. In the past ten days, a serious road traffic accident occurred within 200 m of the depot in Scarriff. Two ambulances were parked outside the depot but due to the lack of 24-hour rostering at the ambulance base, an ambulance had to be dispatched from Limerick. This resulted in an unnecessary delay in bringing a critically injured man to hospital.I have the utmost faith in the ambulance personnel and the work they do — they provide a very good service. However, the reality is that the service is not provided on a 24-hour basis. I hope the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will put funding in place without delay to bring the east Clare ambulance service into line with that in the rest of County Clare and the mid-west, where ambulance bases are staffed on a 24-hour basis. I am aware that the mid-west ambulance development plan proposes to upgrade the Scarriff service to a 24-hour service. I ask that the Minister considers upgrading this service immediately to take account of the urgent need that has been established in recentweeks, given the incidence of several serious accidents.I am also concerned about the situation at Shannon, the second largest town in Clare, which has a population of almost 10,000 people and experiences a further influx of approximately 8,000 to 10,000 individuals who come to Shannon daily to work at the airport, business parks and industrial estate, which is the largest industrial estate outside Dublin. The airport is the most western airport in Europe and is used as a landing base for aircraft emergencies in the north Atlantic.It might surprise some to know that there is no ambulance base at Shannon and that the current service is provided from depots in Limerick and Ennis. The mid-west ambulance development plan proposes that an ambulance base will be put in place at Shannon but I have been contacted by several people concerned about the delay. In a number of cases, individuals due to be collected by the ambulance service had died by the time ambulances arrived. I am not suggesting that had an ambulance got there on time, it would have saved lives, or that the ambulance personnel at the scene did not do all they could. However, the incidents have caused a level of trauma for the families of the deceased with regard to what might have happened had the ambulances arrived more quickly. It would be best to deal with the concerns as quickly as possible by putting in place the ambulance service. I ask the Minister to expedite the establishment of the base at Shannon with the appropriate level of staff to ensure that no unreasonable delays occur in dispatching an ambulance to persons in need in the Shannon area.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I take this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank Senator Dooley for raising the issue. Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive, HSE, has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of ambulance services.There have been a number of developments in the HSE mid-western area ambulance service in recent years. With regard to the upgrading of the ambulance service at Scarriff, the HSE has advised that a new ambulance base commenced operations in the town in June 2003. The new base allowed the executive to increase the number of emergency medical technicians employed from two to six. This reduced the amount of on-call cover from 55 hours to 16 hours per week, resulting in a more efficient and effective response to patient needs. The HSE mid-western region has included a request for funding to fully eliminate on-call service in its service plan 2005 and its recently completed development plan for the ambulance service. Requests for ambulance service developments are being considered by the HSE in the context of its priority requirements for 2006.The HSE mid-western area has four ambulance stations in County Clare. The Shannon area is traditionally serviced from Limerick and Ennis. In the development plan for the ambulance service, the HSE mid-western area takes into account the future service requirements for the region and it proposes the establishment of a new ambulance station for the Shannon area. Other developments in the HSE mid-western area include the upgrading of the command and control centre in Limerick, which opened in May 2004, and the extension and refurbishment of the ambulance base in Ennis in March 2005. Additional funding was provided in 2005 to complete the implementation of two-person crewing in the region.Much has been achieved in the development of the service, although I recognise that much remains to be done. It is essential to maintain the progress that has been made and to continue the process of service development so that effective pre-hospital emergency care is accessible to those who need it most, when and where it is required. I realise this is not the first occasion on which Senator Dooley has raised the question in the House of ambulance provision in east County Clare. The Minister is committed to working towards the improvements the Senator is anxious to see realised in this area.

I ask him to continue the effort to ensure the funding is put in place without delay. As he stated, it is a matter of moving to the next stage in terms of upgrading. We are happy to know the funding has been included in the plan going forward, but it is important to move to the next stage. I am sure the Minister of State will do his utmost to ensure this happens without delay.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environtment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, for coming to the House to respond to this Adjournment matter, which concerns the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the breakdown of the funding given to promote national heritage week on a county basis. There is also a need to outline this breakdown on a heritage area basis. We know that national heritage week is an important event for our country. Those who live near historical monuments, for example abbeys, do not necessarily visit these monuments unless they are open to the public for free. We need to publicise national heritage week to encourage people to visit sites such as local abbeys. I look forward to the details which the Minister of State will offer to the House.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I thank Senator Feighan for raising this matter and for allowing me the opportunity of addressing the topic of heritage week. Heritage week is part of the European heritage days initiative introduced by the Council of Europe in 1991 with the support of the European Union. Ireland was one of the first countries to take part in European heritage days and this year over 40 countries are participating. European heritage days aims to promote awareness of our built, natural and cultural heritage and to foster mutual understanding. The slogan "Europe: a common heritage" stresses centuries of shared history and demonstrates the will to further strengthen the European dimension.In Ireland, rather than just one day each year, we dedicate a week of events to celebrate Ireland's own heritage and our shared European heritage. The week-long programme has been popular and successful in the past, and we continued this approach this year, with the week running from Sunday, 4 September to Sunday, 11 September. Over 500 events took place throughout the country, offering something to appeal to all family members and people of all ages. The events included guided tours and lectures, music recitals, historical re-enactments, exhibitions, traditional crafts, nature walks and field tripsin a wide variety of venues throughout the country.In August this year the Minister, Deputy Roche, launched a new website dedicated to heritage week which was developed by the Heritage Council. The website, www.heritageweek.ie, provided detailed information on heritage week 2005 organised both by date and by county, making it easy for people to find the events that interest them. I am pleased we were able to reach more people, not only with details of events which were organised prior to heritage week but also with additional events as these were posted on the website during heritage week. The website is now underdoing additional enhancements for the promotion of heritage week next year, the dates for which will be decided shortly.Heritage week is co-ordinated by the Heritage Council in partnership with my Department and the council will recoup its costs. These costs relate to the development of the website and other publicity and advertising programmes nationally, regionally and locally on radio, printed media and posters. I do not have details of the breakdown of these costs.In addition, my Department has spent almost €8,000 on event application forms, posters and programme details. The Department also provided a grant of €10,000 to Cork City Council for Cork heritage open day on 10 September in conjunction both with heritage week and Cork as European capital of culture.Many organisations are involved in the promotion of heritage week, including local authorities, the OPW, the Department of Education and Science, An Chomhairle Leabharlanna and Fáilte Ireland. These carry their own costs for the week, including for example free entrance to OPW sites on both Sundays of heritage week. Each year, many local community organisations participate in heritage week by organising and promoting events. These organisations include schools, churches, community groups, youth clubs, drama groups, local historians, wildlife experts, musicians, artists and anyone who is willing to provide ideas, information and support. All these community efforts are a valuable contribution to heritage week and I am happy that the organisers can use the occasion to contribute to their localities and at the same time generate enhanced awareness for their work. Their contribution is very much recognised and appreciated and I thank them sincerely.The Department does not compile the costs incurred by other bodies and community groups and I am not persuaded of the need to do this. This does not give the Senator the specific details for which he is looking but, presumably, they will be available when the data are compiled.

I am a little disappointed the Department does not compile the costs.

The Department does not compile the costs of efforts by other organisations but perhaps it can do so in respect of the Heritage Council on a county and site basis.
