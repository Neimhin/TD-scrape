        <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">I wish to commence by stating that initially, Deputy Martin was entirely right to hand over to the Taoiseach last week material he had received from a member of An Garda Síochána, Sergeant Maurice McCabe. The Taoiseach acknowledged that they were serious matters and undertook to review them. Had Deputy Martin's primary motivation been to have these allegations examined, the proper course of action would have been to let the Taoiseach, who made it clear that he was treating the matter as one of the utmost seriousness, proceed with that examination and respond to the Deputy. Instead, Deputy Martin came into this House last Thursday brandishing a document he states was in my possession for two years. What the Deputy's allegations amounted to was that serious allegations against the Garda had not been addressed, that I had done nothing about them and that I had not responded to correspondence from Sergeant McCabe.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> The manner in which Deputy Martin presented the matter understandably led most people to believe that the allegations made had never before been addressed, had only arisen since my appointment as Minister and that the cases concerned had only arisen during my time in office. Moreover, he sought to copper-fasten this impression by accusing me of undermining the administration of justice in this State. No timeline was given by Deputy Martin for the cases investigated by An Garda Síochána or which had come before the courts. Moreover, no distinction was made by him between operational matters, which are the responsibility of An Garda Síochána, and policy issues, which are my responsibility, a distinction well understood by my Fianna Fáil predecessors in the justice portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> I intend to demonstrate to the House today that none of Deputy Martin's political charges is true. Deputy Martin has spoken much in recent days about the maladministration of justice. There are of course fundamental principles of justice that are crucial to this State. They concern fundamental constitutional and human rights and the rule of law, which is something to which I have been passionately committed throughout my adult life. As Minister, I cannot opt to respect the rights of one person and ignore the rights of others. Put simply, while of course any allegations of wrongdoing must be taken seriously, allegations are not facts. I cannot proceed on an assumption that allegations made by one member of An Garda Síochána against many of his colleagues are correct and ignore the rights of those against whom allegations are made. This basic principle holds whether we are talking about An Garda Síochána or any other organisation, group or individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> I have no doubt that many people outside this House must find bewildering the twists and turns regarding what by any standards is a complex set of circumstances but I am sure they clearly understand one thing, namely, allegations are not facts and basic fairness requires that when allegations are made against people, they should not be assumed to be guilty without hearing the other side of the story or without evidence.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_6">What is crucial is that the evidence for allegations made is carefully and properly examined. Allegations ultimately may be proved to be true, partially true or false. Where false, the original allegation need not be malicious in any way but may derive from a mistaken perception or understanding of events. Life is complicated and not everything is simply black and white. As Minister, I am solemnly bound to protect the rights of all citizens, be they gardaí or anyone else, and to behave at all times in accordance with the laws. I also wish to make clear that I have no animosity towards Sergeant McCabe. I have previously acknowledged that important changes have been implemented with regard to the fixed charge notice system arising from matters raised by Sergeant McCabe. I have absolutely no wish to have a continuing public or indeed private dispute with a serving member of An Garda Síochána. I believe it is of crucial importance that whistleblowers are treated with respect and their allegations taken seriously. I will return at a later stage to one matter relating to the ticket charge issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> Unfortunately, today a situation has been reached in which other allegations made by Sergeant McCabe have become caught up in partisan and divisive political debate. If all sides of the House can agree on one thing today, surely it is that the legal arrangements for dealing with Garda whistleblowers have failed when these matters are being dealt with across the floor of this House and where the Deputies opposite seek political advantage and apparently do not mind what damage they might do to An Garda Síochána and those who serve in it. In the case of Sinn Féin, I will simply observe that old habits die hard. However, I must state frankly to Deputy Martin that whatever political disagreements I may have had with him or with the Fianna Fáil Party over the years, many of the former statesmen in his party would be appalled by the cavalier attitude he has taken to An Garda Síochána, against which he has made the most serious allegations without waiting to establish the truth or otherwise thereof. I regret, in particular, the lack of regard he has shown to the Office of the Garda Commissioner, which at present is occupied by a person appointed by the Government of which he was a member and which no doubt made the appointment on the basis of its full confidence in him.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> In fairness to members of An Garda Síochána, I cannot simply take at face value serious allegations made against them and assume they are guilty until proven innocent. This is not the approach of our legal system and nor is it compatible with concepts of constitutional justice and human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I also have to be careful in my presentation to this House today not to stray into areas that are matters in contention currently between Sergeant McCabe and the State and which are the subject of court proceedings taken by him. I hope Members of the House will appreciate that, during this debate and questions, we all have to respect the existence of two sets of legal proceedings which Sergeant McCabe has taken seeking damages against the State, one set initiated in 2009 which includes the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a named defendant and a second set initiated in 2011 in which the Minister for Justice and Equality is not named as a defendant. In both sets of proceedings the Garda Commissioner is so named.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> With regard to the allegations which Deputy Martin made in the House last Thursday and which he has repeated at every opportunity both inside and outside the House since then, I want to deal first with the entirely incorrect assertion that nothing had been done in regard to a series of serious allegations involving Garda misbehaviour. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 - introduced by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, into this House contains clear legal procedures for dealing with alleged misbehaviour by members of An Garda Síochána. I am not going to make much of the fact that the behaviour which Deputy Martin characterised as maladministration of justice took place long before I took office, but the key fact is that all of the cases brought to my attention on 23 January 2012 occurred in the 2007 to 2008 period and they were all addressed under the arrangements which the Government of which he was a member put in place, in light of the findings of the Morris tribunal. Far from nothing being done, it seems to me from my review of the papers relating to this matter, that those procedures were scrupulously observed.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> In 2008, Sergeant McCabe made a written complaint to Garda headquarters alleging neglect of duty and other malpractice by gardaí at Bailieboro Garda station, and failure by the superintendent to respond properly when Sergeant McCabe had brought these concerns to his attention. Sergeant McCabe also claimed that he had been victimised. A chief superintendent was appointed to investigate these allegations. Later in 2008, the then Garda Commissioner received an anonymised complaint, which turned out to be from Sergeant McCabe, from the then Garda confidential recipient, Brian McCarthy, making allegations in regard to malpractice at Bailieboro Garda station, and in regard to the failure of senior gardaí at the station to respond to these concerns when they had been brought to their attention. An assistant commissioner was appointed to investigate these allegations.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> The allegations covered cases such as the failure to notify a court in a child abduction case that the accused was already on bail facing serious charge; failure to properly investigate several cases; failure to forward a report relating to poor standards and conditions at Bailieboro station; falsification of records; failure to deal with sexual harassment of a female garda; and the giving of a direction to Sergeant McCabe to cease assessing and monitoring probationary gardaí. In 2009, the Garda Commissioner received a further report from the confidential recipient, in which Sergeant McCabe alleged harassment and victimisation arising by the making by him of the first report. Later in 2009, a further report was received from the confidential recipient again relating to harassment. The assistant commissioner, along with the chief superintendent, was appointed to investigate these allegations too.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> In case Deputy Martin is concerned that this was not the correct procedure, it might be helpful to point out that Sergeant McCabe in 2009 wrote to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, alerting him to the fact that he had made a complaint about malpractice and corruption in the Bailieboro Garda district. In this letter, Sergeant McCabe claimed that although a preliminary report into his complaint had revealed bad practice and procedure, the chief superintendent of the division had publicly rubbished the complaint, and the sergeant called on the Minister to ask for an independent person to oversee the investigation. The Minister replied, through his private secretary, that the conduct of the investigation was a matter for the Garda Commissioner, in accordance with the Garda Síochána Act 2005, that the Minister had no role in directing the Commissioner in such operational matters, and that, in the circumstances, the most appropriate action was to allow the Commissioner to complete his work and let due process take its course. I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not criticising the response of my predecessor to Sergeant McCabe although I accept, of course, that it might have been helpful to Deputy Martin if he had been aware of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The investigation by the assistant commissioner over a lengthy period culminated in the submission of ten volumes of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who - of course independently - directed that no prosecutions were warranted.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">The investigation did result in disciplinary action against a number of gardaí. It is very important to note that under the legal procedures in place, the confidential recipient and, crucially, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman were informed of these matters. The thinking behind the provisions of the 2005 Act was this: the Garda Síochána Ombudsman was to be advised by the Garda Commissioner of complaints received by the confidential recipient so that it could initiate its own investigation in the public interest if it considered it warranted doing so. The fact that this could happen would also act as a form of what might be termed "quality control" in regard to any Garda investigation. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, was informed in June 2010 of the progress of the assistant commissioner's investigation and, shortly afterwards, of the decision by the DPP. While GSOC dealt with a small number of relevant complaints which had been made to it - and which I will deal with in a moment - it does not appear to have felt it necessary to take any further action.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The commission at the time comprised Mr. Dermot Gallagher, Mr. Conor Brady and Ms Carmel Foley. Again, I am voicing no criticism of them as to how they dealt with this matter, but the essential facts are these: the allegations were dealt with under the procedures in place at the time, and the confidential recipient, the DPP and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission fulfilled their statutory roles in regard to them. I doubt that any fair-minded observer would regard these as a set of allegations about which nothing had been done. I doubt that Deputy Martin would have come into the Dáil Chamber in 2009 or 2010 and made such charge against former Minister, Dermot Ahern, and accused him of undermining the administration of justice in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I think it is only fair to note too that while many of the allegations referred to possible shortcomings in Garda investigations, and there were some shortcomings or failures identified, nevertheless a number ultimately resulted in successful prosecutions and convictions. For the sake of completeness, I should mention also that there were complaints from Sergeant McCabe of alleged assault and imprisonment against the assistant commissioner who conducted the investigation. This, in turn, was investigated by a deputy commissioner who submitted a file to the DPP who directed no prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Of course, I understand that Sergeant McCabe did not accept the outcome of these investigations and that is his right. However, I am sure the House will appreciate that there is no mechanism that can guarantee all complainants will be at all times fully satisfied with the outcome of all investigations. What is important is that there are procedures in place to deal with allegations and, as I have pointed out, the procedures put in place by the previous Government with regard to all of these matters were followed. Over three weeks ago I announced that I intended to introduce reforms to the current statutory provisions and procedures because from my experience of them I had concluded they were deeply flawed. That was before any of the recent controversies arose.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> This brings me to the question of contacts between Sergeant McCabe and my Department and, in particular, the allegation that I took no action in regard to correspondence received from him. On 23 January 2012, I received a report from the then Garda confidential recipient, Mr. Oliver Connolly, attaching a letter which had been anonymised but which turned out to be from Sergeant McCabe and which included 12 allegations against a named superintendent, for either direct wrongdoing or not dealing properly with wrongdoing, a complaint against the assistant commissioner for the alleged assault and false imprisonment previously mentioned, and a complaint against the Garda Commissioner for permitting the named superintendent to be on a panel for promotion to chief superintendent in circumstances where the Garda Commissioner knew, or ought to have known of, the alleged wrongdoing of the superintendent. Not only were there accusations of malpractice but also of corruption in that gardaí were generally accused of engaging in falsifying records, erasing official records, erasing reported incidents, destroying and altering official records, covering up serious investigations and “gross dereliction of duty on a massive scale”. In fairness to the rights of everyone involved I want to emphasise that these were - at the time - anonymous allegations and they should not be taken as evidence of anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> I should explain that reports from the confidential recipient are only forwarded to me where an allegation is made against the Commissioner. I took the letter so seriously that on 24 January, the following day, my Secretary General, at my request, wrote to the Garda Commissioner seeking an urgent report. The Commissioner's detailed response, received by me on 30 January, described the investigations that had been undertaken and the chronology of events and explained that, of the 12 allegations against the superintendent, 11 had already been dealt with as part of the investigation by the assistant commissioner and chief superintendent. In other words, the January 2012 letter from Sergeant McCabe restated these 11 complaints which had already been dealt with under the statutory confidential recipient scheme. The Commissioner also explained that the 12th allegation in the January 2012 letter related to a case of "child pornography and rape of a minor in September, 2007 where the offender was a priest" and which came before the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">The report went on to explain that this investigation centred on offensive and inappropriate behaviour with a 14 year old boy and that it was apparent that the investigation was efficiently and speedily carried out, resulting in the priest being convicted and sentenced to five year concurrent sentences. The assurances I received were essentially to the effect that these matters had been fully investigated in accordance with the law in place at the time. On 7 February, I wrote to the confidential recipient and informed him of the response of the Garda Commissioner. </p>
          <p eId="para_29"> To support the political charge he levied against me, Deputy Martin saw fit to draw attention to cases involving a serious assault on Mrs. Mary Lynch and the brutal killing of Mrs. Sylvia Roche Kelly, which offences occurred in 2007. I certainly do not wish to add to the trauma and distress which has been caused by these events by having these cases the subject of public attention again, but it is important to set the record straight. In particular, Deputy Martin again raised yesterday in this House the murder of Sylvia Roche Kelly and its impact on all of her family. It would be entirely wrong to leave unchallenged Deputy Martin's inference that nothing has been done to address concerns about the Garda handling of these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> The House may be aware that Lorcan Roche Kelly, the bereaved husband of Sylvia Roche Kelly, initiated High Court legal proceedings against the State in February 2009, so the State has been aware of particular issues related to her murder since 2009. This is in addition to the State’s awareness of such issues in the context of the broader investigation into her tragic death and prosecution of the perpetrator. Of course, I do not want to say anything which would in any way prejudice those current High Court proceedings. I do, however, want to extend my sympathy to Lorcan Roche Kelly and to all of the late Sylvia Roche Kelly’s family on their terrible loss in dreadful circumstances. I hope there is some comfort in knowing that the individual responsible is presently serving a term of life imprisonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> Deputy Martin talked of the need for an independent inquiry into matters that have understandably been raised by Mr. Roche Kelly. In June 2009, he lodged a complaint with the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to the effect that there was neglect of duty on the part of gardaí in Tipperary and Cavan-Monaghan whom he believed failed to liaise properly in order to ensure that the relevant District Court was suitably advised that a person was on bail for other very serious offences when that person appeared before the District Court on another serious charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission initiated an investigation and, in the light of its investigation, subsequently referred the matter to An Garda Síochána on the basis that the matter should be considered as a less serious breach of discipline in regard to two gardaí. A designated superintendent, having investigated the case, decided that there was insufficient evidence to find either member in breach of discipline. While I do not wish to underestimate in any way the seriousness of what happened, the judgment of an independent body, GSOC, was that what was at issue was a less serious breach of discipline and I am advised GSOC did not make any finding under its statutory provisions of Garda misconduct. </p>
          <p eId="para_33"> I hope Deputy Martin and other Members can accept that GSOC was the appropriate independent body to adjudicate on this matter. In fact, the bereaved husband wrote to the then Minister, Dermot Ahern, in 2009 about this distressing case. In one of his replies, sent through his private secretary, the then Minister expressed his sympathy and explained how a complaint could be made to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. Like everyone in this House, I share and understand the concerns that have been voiced in regard to this matter, but it seems that Deputy Martin was unaware of the complaint made to GSOC and its determination and I suspect also unaware that Lorcan Roche Kelly had been in correspondence with my predecessor Mr. Dermot Ahern. I am sure that if Deputy Martin had been aware of this, he might have taken a more considered approach to that taken in this House on Thursday last and again yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> I want to extend my deep sympathy also to Mary Lynch, who was the victim of a very serious assault. Subsequent to an individual being charged with that assault, he was charged with a further serious offence and granted bail by the District Court. A serious issue arose as to the adequacy of the information furnished to the District Court by An Garda Síochána at the time bail was granted, while I am advised that the bail application was vigorously opposed. Our courts are independent and such decisions are a matter for them. I do not feel it appropriate that I further address this matter as, while GSOC discontinued a complaint from Mary Lynch - because it was out of time - about aspects of how her case was treated, I understand from what she has said publicly that she currently has another complaint before GSOC and I do not want to say anything that would be regarded as prejudicing the outcome of this complaint. It is, however, clear to me from a complaint properly made by Mary Lynch that there was a failure by An Garda Síochána to inform her of the hearing and determination in the District Court of the criminal prosecution taken against the individual who assaulted her. While the court imposed two concurrent nine month sentences on the individual concerned, she should have had the opportunity to be present in court. I am advised that, prior to my time as Minister, as a result of the failure to advise Mary Lynch to be present in the District Court on the day when a plea of guilty was entered by the defendant in her case and sentence imposed, An Garda Síochána internally addressed this failure. </p>
          <p eId="para_35"> It is of considerable importance that the victims of crime are kept properly informed of progress made in the investigation and prosecution of their case and I am greatly concerned by any case where there is a failure to keep a victim informed. In this context, when in opposition, I brought forward in both 2002 and 2008, victims' rights Bills to impose a statutory duty on gardaí to inform victims of trial dates. Unfortunately, in 2008 when Deputy Martin was a senior Government Minister, his Government chose to vote down that measure. Such legislation is currently under preparation in my Department and will incorporate within it provisions regarding victims of crime which are now incorporated in an EU directive. I expect that legislation will come before this House in 2015. </p>
          <p eId="para_36"> I do not intend to go into any detail today about correspondence with Sergeant McCabe about penalty points. This issue has been referred to GSOC and we should let it get on with its work. </p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I do, however, want to deal with the charge that I misled this House by claiming that Sergeant McCabe had not co-operated with the investigation carried out by Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney. I expected that Sergeant McCabe would fully engage as a member of An Garda Síochána with Assistant Commissioner O’Mahoney’s investigation team and that he would be interviewed. These are operational matters in which no Minister for Justice should interfere and, of course, any such interference would be rightly subject to public criticism. I have no interest in continuing contention with Sergeant McCabe about this matter, but the House will appreciate I cannot leave a charge of misleading it stand. I do not think it is disputed, following the furnishing to the O’Mahoney investigation team of formal allegations and documentation, which originated from Sergeant McCabe and former Garda Wilson, that there was no engagement between either Garda member with the investigation team before Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney completed his report. What is at issue is an interpretation of events which preceded publication of that report.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> In what I said to the House, I relied on material which I received detailing the content of a direction given to Sergeant McCabe on a related matter, which included inviting him to participate in the O’Mahoney investigation and the fact that a letter had been sent from an official of my Department in December 2012 which, specifically, advised Sergeant McCabe that any further information which might be helpful to the investigation should be brought by him to the attention of his authorities within the force. This letter is one of a number of letters exchanged by my Department either directly with Sergeant McCabe or with his solicitors. The situation is further complicated by the fact that between the finalisation of the O'Mahoney report and its publication, he declined to take up an offer from Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney to meet with a member of his investigation team. Had such a meeting taken place and some additional matters arisen of relevance to the investigation, I could have been notified of any amendment required to be made to the report undertaken and its publication could have been delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> Clearly there is a difference of views and perception between An Garda Síochána and Sergeant McCabe with regard to this issue. I have explained the basis on which I made my statement and I can take it no further. However, I want to make it clear, because of some public comment that has been made, that there is no basis for the suggestion that the Garda Commissioner in any way misled me on this matter. Nor is there any basis for an allegation that I in any way misled the House. I appreciate that different Members of the House may perceive these matters differently. It is unfortunate that perceptions are coloured on occasion by political differences. </p>
          <p eId="para_40"> There is one further set of allegations made by Sergeant McCabe which, for completeness, I should mention. On 4 September 2012, solicitors for Sergeant McCabe wrote to me enclosing three booklets of documentation containing multiple allegations of Garda wrongdoing and requesting the establishment of a special inquiry, under section 42 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. Some of these allegations related to penalty points and there was a cross-over with some of the earlier allegations I have mentioned. The correspondence was marked strictly private and confidential. On 18 October, my office wrote to the solicitors seeking confirmation that they had no objection to the booklets being forwarded to the Garda Commissioner for his observations. Clearly, I could not decide to establish a statutory inquiry without being aware of all the facts. My office also asked the solicitors to forward copies of PULSE records referred to in the documentation which had not been enclosed. When by 22 November no response had been received, a further reminder was sent to the solicitors by my office.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">A further reminder was sent by my office on 3 January 2013. I think it is clear that if I was intent on ignoring allegations by Sergeant McCabe, I would not have been so assiduous in trying to elicit responses from his solicitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> At that stage, the solicitors replied saying that all the information had been provided to the office of the Department of the Taoiseach which had forward it to the Department of Justice and Equality. In turn, my office replied on 11 March 2013, pointing out the documentation provided to the Department of the Taoiseach related to different allegations, and again asked for the condition of confidentiality to be lifted to enable the matter to be pursued. On 1 May 2013, a further letter was received from the solicitors requesting a copy of the O'Mahony report and repeating the assertion that the records had been provided. Again on 22 May 2013, my office replied seeking a waiver of confidentiality. I do not know why the waiver of confidentiality requested was not forthcoming. However, I was properly conscious of the fact Sergeant McCabe had expressed serious concerns about the observance of privacy and confidentiality in relation to other correspondence, and that he would expect that to be respected. What is clear is that I did everything possible to try to move this issue forward, taking into account Sergeant McCabe's position on the matter. I very much welcome the fact that I will be able to provide this documentation to Mr. Sean Guerin SC.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> While preserving the confidentiality requested by Sergeant McCabe, some of the issues raised by him revisited some of the matters of relevance to the earlier correspondence with the confidential recipient, and in this context, my Secretary General wrote again to the Garda Commissioner in late December 2012, as Sergeant McCabe had revisited some of these matters and he received a further detailed response from the Garda Commissioner in February 2013. This correspondence will also be provided to Mr. Guerin.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I can only assume that had Deputy Martin been aware of the extent of both my engagement, and my Department officials' engagement, in issues arising from allegations contained in the letter received by me on 23 January 2012, and had he known of the events that had taken place in the preceding years, the charge he made against me would not have been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> This brings me to the series of decisions which we took in Cabinet yesterday. We did so against the background that the procedures for dealing with both whistleblowers and complaints, which I inherited under the Garda Síochána Act 2005, had not operated in a way which had fully addressed the complex circumstances of this particular case. It was also our considered view that these matters could not be adequately addressed in this Chamber or in an Oireachtas committee. Therefore, what we decided yesterday is designed not just to address this particular set of allegations but to look to the future to avoid this type of situation arising again.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Before this controversy erupted, I had already stated that, as far as I was concerned, the confidential recipient arrangements were not working. The Government approved my proposals yesterday to allow for legislation in tandem with the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, sponsored by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to allow gardaí to make complaints directly to GSOC. Pending the early enactment of that legislation, we will be appointing an interim confidential recipient. Mr. Sean Guerin SC is undertaking an assessment of issues and allegations from Sergeant McCabe since 2008. He is being asked to report his findings before the Easter recess and to make recommendations. The report will be published immediately, and if he recommends a commission of inquiry, there will be one. The justice committee will have hearings on Garda accountability arrangements and will, in particular, consider the amendments required to be made to the Garda Síochána Act 2005 with regard to the workings of GSOC.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Members opposite maintain that a commission of inquiry is needed immediately. Deputy Martin and others clearly did so without knowing all the facts. It seems among the facts that Deputy Martin did not know was that both Sergeant McCabe and Lorcan Roche Kelly had each written to his former colleague in the previous Government, the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Dermot Ahern, whom I do not hold at fault in any way. I believe that the approach announced by the Taoiseach yesterday and agreed in Cabinet is the right course initially and there remains the possibility, following on from the consideration given to all these matters in the report by Mr. Sean Guerin, that an independent statutory inquiry may be required. Equally it may not, and I do not wish to prejudge that issue. It is entirely a matter for Mr. Guerin in his conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> My concern is, as always, that the full truth is known. From Deputy Martin’s contribution in this House last Thursday and his dramatic appearance on the plinth last Wednesday, he raised these very important issues as if they were entirely new, had never arisen during his term in the previous Government and had never been addressed either by the confidential recipient, An Garda Síochána or GSOC. He falsely accused me of undermining the administration of justice, a charge which I entirely reject. It has been a central personal commitment of my entire adult life that we have the best system possible to administer justice in the State, and for many years during my period in this House, it was Deputy Martin’s party that obstinately opposed and delayed the implementation of crucial reform and the modernisation of our criminal justice system. A commitment to the rule of law and to the principle that individuals are innocent until proven guilty is a central feature and a proven principle of this democracy which should not be overthrown by any Member of this House seeking political gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> Of course it is crucial that An Garda Síochána adheres to the highest standards, that public confidence is maintained in the force and that it does not operate under a cloud of suspicion. It is also crucial that there is public confidence in our independent oversight structure designed to investigate allegations of Garda wrongdoing. That is why, over three weeks ago and prior to any of the controversies, I announced my intention to abolish the office of the confidential recipient and to reform the Garda Síochána Act 2005 in respect of provisions applicable to GSOC. I thank my Cabinet colleagues for their support for these crucial reforms which were a priority previous to the events of the last two weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> I hope that the processes we have put in place will deal effectively with any wrongdoing, but also avoid clouds of suspicion being allowed linger unfairly. I look forward to the report of Mr. Sean Guerin and, like my colleagues in Government, I am fully committed to our taking any action necessary on foot of that report.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_51">I welcome the fact that Dáil Éireann has been allowed to hold a debate on a matter of grave public importance. Nothing is more important to the work we are elected to do than ensuring all officers of the State work to protect the public and promote justice for all. Throughout history, a core foundation of democracy has been a willingness to question those who are given the power to administer justice. There is no police force in the world that is completely free from problems and there never will be. I have no doubt a significant reason Ireland is now one of the world’s older democracies has been the success of An Garda Síochána. It has built and maintained public confidence through the most challenging of situations, in particular when faced with a private army which viewed itself as the real State and the ongoing struggle against lawless gangs who seek to terrorise too many communities. It is a tribute to the Garda that throughout the country people are protesting against the Government’s policy of downgrading the links between gardaí and the communities they serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> We should all reject absolutely the idea that to raise concerns is in any way to question the work of the force a whole, something the Minister again did in the initial part of his speech. When serious questions arise, public representatives and the Government we elect have a duty to ensure they are comprehensively and objectively investigated. In fact, the only way of protecting the standing of the force is to have public trust that failings are actively being sought and dealt with.<b>
						</b>We have a duty to act in such a way as to encourage people with evidence of wrongdoing to come forward. Over the years we have all learned there are no institutions beyond criticism, scrutiny and accountability, and that is what a healthy democracy represents. In this House, we have also learned that setting up an independent inquiry can actually assist with maintaining confidence in the justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> The basic background to this debate is that serious questions have arisen on a number of fronts and there is no faith that they have been handled properly. That is the bottom line. The announcement yesterday of a review of one aspect of the controversy comes two years on from the issues being raised, and after weeks of delay and denial.<b>
						</b>This is the Government that, when elected three years ago, promised to value, encourage and protect whistleblowers as part of its claimed democratic revolution.<b>
						</b>The evidence available to us, however, is that efforts have been made at various levels to dampen if not squash allegations that were made about some past activities within the Garda.<b>
						</b>Other matters concerning the possible bugging of GSOC and the dismissal of the Garda confidential recipient are absolutely linked to the whistleblower allegations, because they form a central element of how the Government is undermining public trust in a vital part of the administration of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> In recent weeks the Minister for Justice and Equality has continually failed to meet the basic test of handling serious allegations effectively. His response and the responses of his colleagues have been to try to end the controversy rather than deal with it.<b>
						</b>The ongoing campaign to try to blame the previous government is as cynical as it is pathetic. The number of Fine Gael Deputies attacking the messenger suggests that the party is co-ordinating this effort.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">The circumstances are not comparable in any shape or form, yet the Minister wants to go down the road of distraction. After a week's silence, the Minister gave a few exclusive comments to one journalist last night in which he signalled he would go on the attack today and had been trawling in his Department all week for evidence to support his case. Only the most gullible will accept, having listened to the Minister this morning, that he tried to give a balanced and fair view of the record. He has a proven track record of selective quotations and has been driven constantly by an obsessive need to justify himself. There is no reason to believe he has given the House a full and balanced picture of what is in the Department's files.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> While the Minister believes he has been smeared because others had the nerve to question him, he should remember that the Taoiseach explicitly stated that I have handled this matter responsibly. He must also face the inconvenient fact that while he announced today that he has reviewed the matter and found he was right in everything he has done, the Cabinet stated yesterday that the matter needed to be reviewed externally. That is a significant point, as it is the view of the Cabinet, in particular, the Taoiseach, having read the dossier. <b>
						</b>Does the Minister expect us to believe that when the Taoiseach and Tánaiste refer to the issues involved as "grave" and state they cannot make up their minds who to believe and the matter needs external review and possibly an investigation, they do so because they believe everything is fine?</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> There is substantive evidence that there is an ongoing and profound problem in how allegations of improper behaviour in the Garda are handled. A culture of deep suspicion has developed, meaning that the relationships between the Minister, the Garda Commissioner, the Office of the Confidential Recipient and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission are at best dysfunctional and at worst actively subverting the goal of dealing with allegations of improper behaviour. The Minister and Garda Commissioner have admitted that these relations are poor. An atmosphere that leads the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to hire a British company to screen its offices for bugs is one in which the public interest is not being served.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> The paperwork around this review is being reviewed by a former High Court judge, despite the fact that the Minister did his level best to dismiss these concerns out of hand. It remains a disgrace that he refused to consult the Oireachtas on the terms of the review and that Mr. Justice Cooke is not being allowed to check evidence.<b>
						</b>It is now a consistent tactic of the Government that when a Minister is caught in a crisis, as occurs with increasing frequency, the first priority is to manage the media rather than the issue.<b>
						</b>We have seen this approach in operation in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> Before today, the Minister was unavailable to the public whereas active behind-the-scenes briefing was taking place non-stop.<b>
						</b>While this debate is welcome, Members have not been supplied with any of the documents the Minister used to try to undermine the allegations and attack others. If the Minister had intended this debate to be a genuine effort to allow questioning, he would have circulated the relevant reports, especially the report of the Garda Inspectorate, and supplied a briefing to the Opposition. He could also have provided access to the files he has used to formulate today’s attack but of course chose not to do so. Why would he allow anyone the chance to answer back?</p>

						</b>From early yesterday evening, the Government was briefing the media that the Minister would come into the House with all guns blazing and had the evidence to back up his case.

          <p eId="para_66">He has consistently refused to even contemplate the idea that he could be wrong and repeatedly impugned the integrity of any Deputy, Senator, journalist or member of the public who has challenged him. In recent days, his Government colleagues have chosen to circle the wagons around him by hyping his record and claiming he is always reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> The Minister does not recognise the legitimacy of any criticism. When challenged he is sometimes snide, frequently partisan and always dismissive.<b>
						</b>Within weeks of his appointment he started as he intended to continue by withholding from the Dáil essential information about the progress of the Smithwick tribunal. While pushing through a guillotined Bill to limit the time for the tribunal’s work, the Minister withheld essential correspondence with Judge Smithwick. When this was exposed, he attacked anyone who questioned him.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> Crucially, the Minister did exactly the same thing when he appointed his friend and donor as Garda confidential recipient nearly three years ago. His speech this morning was remarkable in that he was silent on the entire episode pertaining to the confidential recipient. At the time of the appointment of the confidential recipient, he went as far as describing as "despicable" anyone questioning whether the appointment was appropriate.<b>
						</b>In 2011, it was put to the Minister that appointing a friend and donor meant the confidential recipient might not be able to act fully independently of the Minister and that, at a minimum, his performance of that role would be influenced by his connection with the Minister. These fears have been fully realised.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> The Minister’s decision to fire Mr. Connolly has shown that he is willing to lay down his friends to protect himself. It is not true that the transcript which Deputy Mick Wallace and I brought to public attention clears the Minister. Incidentally, the confidential recipient informed Sergeant Maurice McCabe that he fully believed him, before he handed the relevant material to the Minister. What the transcript confirms again and again is that Mr. Connolly and the Minister were in regular contact about the allegations. It includes a direct statement by the Minister's friend and donor that the Minister might not be acting fully independently of the Garda Commissioner.<b>
						</b>It appears from the statement the Minister released from Greece and about which he did not answer any questions that Mr. Connolly was fired because he told a whistleblower, "if Shatter thinks you’re screwing him you’re finished". This statement has been described by various Government sources as an outrageous reflection on the Minister, one which made inevitable Mr. Connolly's departure from his position.<b>
						</b>At no stage was Mr. Connolly given the opportunity to give his side of the story. <b>
						</b>He is quoted in the transcript, which is clearly authentic, as saying the following to Sergeant McCabe:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_70">Shatter would have read your report in detail, I know he did, he communicated with me and he will have read all of your exhibits, which I actually labelled them numbered one to nine in the actual in the order they were highlighted so he did know. And you know I redacted, the only thing I redacted was your name. Alan studied everything in fact I know he did.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">Before today, the Minister's only comment about the transcript was made on 6 February, which was before he saw it.<b>
						</b>When one reads the dossier the cases jump out at one. There is, therefore, no point in creating a smokescreen about there being ten dossiers and so forth. I met the mother, sisters and brother of Sylvia Roche Kelly. They were not told anything and they were certainly not told about the totality and sequencing of that entire episode, from the abduction and savage beating of Mary Lynch, to the abduction of a five year old child in Dundrum to the savage murder of Sylvia Roche Kelly. While I accept that the following question is a subjective judgment, I ask the Minister if he asked any questions about what happened or the sequence of events in that case. </p>

          <p eId="para_84"> Before the Minister tried to distract me, I was about to raise the core question of whether failings ultimately lead to the murder of Sylvia Roche Kenny. Perhaps that murder could have been prevented. That is a difficult statement to make. I did not want to discuss these matters in detail in the House but I have details of all the cases. The Taoiseach described the issue as grave for that reason. In one case, a young woman who was savagely beaten received €150 - €50 from each attacker.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">In another case, a man was savagely beaten and the case was not entered in the PULSE system for nine months. That is the point. We can dress up the issue or create smokescreens all we like, but the quality of internal investigations is at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">It is not unprecedented in terms of the Morris tribunal or beyond belief that things could have gone wrong. The cases involved are grave. I sent that information to the Taoiseach rather than go down a different route and let it end up in the public domain, which would have been wrong and prejudicial to the rights and entitlements of other people who are mentioned in the dossier. I did not do that. I studiously avoided doing so. That is the reason for the decision taken by the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> In terms of the approach of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, attacking people is his standard operating procedure. The Minister saw nothing wrong with his using a confidential brief from the Garda Commissioner to falsely attack a Deputy of this House. He still does not see any wrong in that. The Minister has expressed disinterest in how information about a Deputy was leaked to try to discredit him. I could go on in terms of the Minister's own situation in relation to breath testing and so on but I will not do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">What we are dealing with here is not an isolated example. This is not a consistent pattern of behaviour built up over three years. For Fine Gael to defend one of its own is not surprising, but the length to which the Labour Party is willing to accept this becomes more incredible by the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> If the contents of the transcript are serious enough for Mr. Connolly to be fired, then they are more than serious enough for the position of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to be untenable. All the transcript does is reveal how we have been operating. A week on from its publication, not one factual statement contained therein has been rebutted. To say that it was proposed to abolish that office anyway is a ridiculous defence, particularly as the Minister, during his three years as Minister for Justice and Equality, has been indifferent to the treatment of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and its reports. The manner in which the Government and the Minister have established a review into the possible bugging of GSOC again suggests that the Minister has prejudged the issue. Of course, he did. He has self-judged documents which involved a conflict of evidence, but has provided Mr. Guerin with no means of testing that conflict of evidence. While Government Deputies constantly refer to an investigation, it is nothing of the sort. The Minister has refused to consult on the terms of the review, even sending out spokespersons to ridicule the idea that he would let a Labour Party colleague oversee a statement. </p>
          <p eId="para_93"> The Minister, in his evidence to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions last week, said there is a conflict of technical evidence which he is not competent to judge, even though that is what he has repeatedly done in trying to bury the entire controversy. Now, as before, an inquiry which is allowed to interview people and seek evidence is the only way of comprehensively and finally dealing with the issue. The eagerness of some to use the fact that GSOC carried out the sweep for bugs to attack the Commission, seek resignations and threaten the continued withholding of access to basic Garda information is striking. This is another issue on which the Minister and Government are silent. The fact that GSOC recommendations on misconduct cases are being ignored has been known for two years. The Minister has only now, and under pressure, shown any interest in this. Fianna Fáil strongly supports the protection of the independence of GSOC. Deputy Niall Collins has published a Bill to allow for the strengthening of GSOC, which will be brought before the House as a Private Members' Bill. If the Government is sincere in its new found concern for GSOC, it will support this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> In bringing the whistleblower allegations to the attention of the Taoiseach, I have been careful not to make specific allegations against identifiable persons. I have been very conscious of the fact that not all of the allegations made to the Morris tribunal were sustained and that we have an obligation to do what we can to allow people due process. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, addressed this issue in his speech at the conclusion of the Morris tribunal when he said it was absurd to expect the Deputy to investigate allegations before seeking their investigation. I welcome the Taoiseach's acknowledgement of the appropriate manner in which I have handled this matter, although the comments of some of his colleagues are partisan politics at its worst. Even though the Government has chosen to commence a review and the Taoiseach has said he is willing to consider going much further, the approach of the Minister has again been to effectively rubbish the idea that there is anything to be concerned about. He has spent the last week reviewing files not open to others and has come in here to declare that he has handled everything well and there is nothing to be concerned about. If that is the case, why is there to be a review? Did the Government actually decide that because everything is fine there is a need for a review process? The Taoiseach said yesterday that he does not know who to believe. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, continually says that everybody believes him.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">The appointment yesterday of Mr. Guerin is an acknowledgement that there is a legitimate reason for concern. Limiting his work to a review and placing on his shoulders the decision regarding the establishment of a full investigation is wrong. I believe his role should be to scope out the basis for such an investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> There is a sense that this review is either a search for a way out or a genuine approach to establish a commission of investigation. I wish Mr. Guerin well and hope he is able to produce a substantive report and guide a future investigation. </p>
          <p eId="para_98"> The allegations contained in the documents I have seen and the concerns which have been expressed to me by a number of people, including Sergeant McCabe and the family of Sylvia Roche Kelly, are so serious and grave that the only way to deal firmly with them is a full inquiry. This will not change. </p>
          <p eId="para_99"> A related issue is the repeated claim of the Minister that Sergeant McCabe refused to co-operate with the inquiry of Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney into his allegations about the handling of penalty points. For some reason, still unclear, the Minister has chosen to specifically criticise and stand by that criticism of Sergeant McCabe. He even criticised him in the Dáil and has spent the past week trying to justify it. The Minister's speech this morning was notable. He does not have the humility to say sorry or-----</p>

          <p eId="para_103">It brings to mind the comments of the confidential recipient: "If Shatter thinks you're screwing him, he'll come after you." Sergeant McCabe has remarked to me that Mr. Connolly was telling the truth in that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, did go after him. This was five weeks after a complaint was made to SIPO. Why did the Minister say that Sergeant McCabe did not co-operate? Why did he state something that is fundamentally untrue? Executives of the Road Safety Authority, to which the Cabinet referred the O'Mahoney report, told the Minister during meetings with him that Sergeant McCabe had not been approached or interviewed, but the Minister argued that he had been. He was not and the Minister knows that. Nobody from the investigation team contacted by text, e-mail or telephone Sergeant McCabe in the context of his being interviewed in relation to that inquiry. That is the bottom line. The Road Safety Authority wrote to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sports, Deputy Varadkar, highlighting all of the failings of the O'Mahoney report, the chief failing being a failure to interview the whistleblowers. This is not something of which the Minister was not aware. This was a live issue for about six months, in particular from April to May of last year. The whistleblower also wrote to the Taoiseach. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, knowing the whistleblower had not been interviewed, told the Taoiseach whether or not he was interviewed was an operational matter and that he would not be getting involved. He then came into the Dáil in October and accused Sergeant McCabe of having not co-operated. Does the Minister see the inconsistency?</p>

          <p eId="para_110">The Minister would also have been conscious of the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General had vindicated Sergeant McCabe in regard to the penalty point issue. The contrast between the outcome of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the outcome of the O'Mahoney report could not be more stark, yet the Minister proceeded to make the allegations he made.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> I have with me a document I received this morning from Sergeant McCabe, which, as I do not have the time to go through it all in the time available to me, I propose to lay before the House for others to read. Basically, he was a year trying to stop the practice of senior Garda officers terminating fixed charges illegally and so forth. Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney or his team never contacted, interviewed, called, telephoned, texted, e-mailed, faxed or visited Sergeant McCabe. That is from Maurice McCabe himself and I am putting it on the record. Some gardaí in Sergeant McCabe's station in Mullingar were contacted and questioned regarding terminations they had carried out. Yet they said they did not meet with any of the investigation team. Does the Minister believe he should apologise for what he said? Does he believe he should, at a minimum, withdraw what he said in respect of the whistleblower? Could he not simply say he was wrong and that he made a mistake? In many ways, the Minister put the Commissioner and others in the firing line unnecessarily and in an unedifying way and we have ended up with rather a Jesuitical interpretation about a direction given in December of last year. It is crazy stuff and there is no need for that type of behaviour. The Minister has been retrospectively trying to justify trawling every record that he could to try to find an e-mail or some letter that would get him off the hook from misleading the Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">Then it ended up on "Prime Time" on Monday night with a sergeant in the Garda force, who happens to be a whistleblower, having to issue a statement in contradiction of either briefings or statements from the Garda Commissioner. That should never have been allowed to happen. The only reason we got to that stage was to protect the Minister's hide and to give him some fig-leaf to hang on to and to justify the statement he made last October. I do not know why he consistently clings to it. In his speeches the Minister says he does not want to go any further and he does not want to dwell on it. Of course we do not want to dwell on it but the man has a basic entitlement to his good name and to the facts in respect of the issue being articulated clearly and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I will lay this before the House in whatever way I can but Sergeant McCabe met the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and he voiced concerns to the Minister that he had not been interviewed. Commissioner Callinan and assistant commissioner O'Mahoney both spoke to the Committee of Public Accounts and their statements are on the record. In fairness, assistant commissioner O'Mahoney admitted at the Committee of Public Accounts that he did not interview Sergeant McCabe, despite the Minister saying the opposite in October 2013 and that he did not co-operate and so on. The Road Safety Authority complained to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, writing to him and stating that Sergeant McCabe had not been interviewed. I presume the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, shared that with the Minister for Justice and Equality. What was the Minister's response?</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> Sergeant McCabe has made it clear to me that he has 28 years' service with a clean discipline record and that, basically, he wants his name cleared. He does not want that slur hanging around him or the accusation that he did not co-operate with the O'Mahoney inquiry. I believe it should be lifted. The Minister should do the honourable thing and withdraw it. Sergeant McCabe was not directed to co-operate with the inquiry. The relevant direction that we have seen was clearly focused on stopping him from accessing the information in the manner he had used to make his initial complaint. I do not know whether it is personal pride or some other unexplained reason but I believe the Minister for Justice and Equality has refused to treat the issue in a detached or objective manner. The undeniable fact is that Garda Sergeant McCabe was not interviewed as part of the investigation into an allegation he made. For most people who are objectively looking on that is extraordinary. This was known to the Minister when he claimed that Garda Sergeant McCabe had failed to co-operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> The Minister is also aware that two bodies, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Road Safety Authority, have expressed deep concerns about the financial and safety aspects of the case. The entire way that it was handled was wrong right up to the Committee of Public Accounts hearing but there is not a hint of acknowledgement from the Minister in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> If the Minister continues to maintain the same approach that he has shown to date then there is every reason to doubt that this affair will come to an end. His lingering resistance to an independent inquiry with powers to get to the bottom of all the different cases appears as strong as ever and it will not go away. Ultimately, the only way to protect public faith in the administration of justice and to ensure it is as strong as ever - the need to vindicate the rights of victims and their families remains absolute - is for the Government to face up to its responsibilities in that regard, but that is still unaddressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> We will continue to pursue the only vehicle which can independently, objectively and outside of the political domain deal with the very grave and serious accusations that have been made - they are grave. I have read through the accusations and there is no sense of their being dealt with adequately or of lessons being learned, which is the key to any investigation. They are rather shocking in what they outline. That is at the core of this issue. The Government should relent and move forward after Mr. Guerin's report with a commission of investigation.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">While I disagree with the Minister for Justice and Equality on many political and ideological issues, I respect the reforming focus he has brought to the necessary eradication of many outdated and inappropriate social anomalies in our system that work to the disadvantage of citizens. I wish to state as much clearly on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> However, on this issue the Minister has failed miserably. What each of these scandals has demonstrated is an unhealthy close relationship between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner. Each scandal has highlighted an inability on the Minister's behalf to properly address the serious issues which have emerged for the justice system and An Garda Síochána. This runs in marked contrast to the rhetoric from the Government about ending cronyism and the need for transparency and accountability. On each occasion, the Minister's first instinct has been to circle the wagons around the Garda Commissioner and other senior gardaí rather than seek to get to the bottom of the various allegations without fear or favour.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> Sinn Féin has come to these issues in a robust manner but we have come to them in a more measured way than our colleagues in Fianna Fáil. We believe that the cumulative effect of these scandals and in particular the Minister's handling of them amount to an issue more serious than the position of the Minister for Justice and Equality. It is clearly now a matter of confidence in the administration of justice and policing and a high degree of confidence is necessary at public level among citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> The first of these scandals came under the Minister's watch when it was revealed that two Garda whistleblowers, John Wilson and Sergeant Maurice McCabe, approached Deputy Clare Daly with their concerns regarding the quashing of penalty points by senior gardaí. In early 2012, the two whistleblowers brought their concerns to the then Garda confidential recipient, Oliver Connolly. After months of apparent stonewalling they decided to take their allegations and evidence to the Road Safety Authority, the Comptroller and Auditor General, various Departments and Ministers and an Teachta Daly. Then, in a move which has been the hallmark of the Minister's tenure, he attacked the complainants. In a television interview he made disgraceful allegations about an Teachta Mick Wallace which clearly came from the Garda Commissioner. As pressure mounted in the Oireachtas, the Minister then settled for an internal Garda inquiry into the issue to be carried out by assistant commissioner John O'Mahoney. After the report of this investigation, which was published in May of last year, the Minister sought to minimise concern about the implementation of the penalty points system by the Garda. He even went onto the plinth to attack the two whistleblowers in a scurrilous effort to undermine their credibility. The Minister would later, wrongly and disgracefully, accuse the Garda whistleblowers of not co-operating with the investigation. He has yet to correct the public record in that regard and he has failed to do so again today.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Not unreasonably, Sergeant Maurice McCabe has asked that if he did not co-operate with the O'Mahoney report, why did that report not mention this? Why did the Minister, Deputy Shatter, not say so when he spoke after the report was published? Why was Sergeant Maurice McCabe not disciplined? Why did assistant commissioner O'Mahoney's team contact and interview numerous officers all over the State, yet ignore Sergeant McCabe?</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> The O'Mahoney report has since been discredited with the publication late last year of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which found that one in five motorists charged with traffic offences in this State were escaping points, that half of all summonses relating to traffic offences were not actually served, and that in some Garda districts there was a penalty points termination rate 50 times higher than in others.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> That report led to the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts which was given a number of boxes of documents from the two whistleblowers backing up their allegations. A very defensive, and many would say a very arrogant, Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan gave evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts. He went as far as saying that the actions of the two whistleblowers were disgusting. These gardaí are mandated, trained and paid to uphold the law and report allegations of law-breaking, yet active efforts were made to prevent them from reporting what they believed were breaches of the law. Who is preventing them? It is the Garda Commissioner supported by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> The Minister, Deputy Shatter, sought to prevent Sergeant Maurice McCabe from providing evidence on the matter. Indeed, it appeared likely that he would initiate court action to prevent that. In my humble opinion, I think that is what forced the change, as the Minister was moved to proceed with some sort of review of all these matters, which in my view and that of my party Sinn Féin, is inadequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> As all of this was unravelling, the revelation came that there was a suspicion of illegal surveillance and bugging at the offices of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. Once again, the Minister's instinct was to seek to put GSOC in the dock. The Taoiseach went on to misrepresent the Garda Síochána Act when he claimed that GSOC had not fulfilled its legal requirements, that GSOC was a law-breaker. He repeated that despite me and others here questioning him until finally he was forced to admit his mistake. The Minister then summoned the GSOC chairman to his office to explain why the Minister and senior members of the Garda Síochána were not informed about GSOC's suspicions. The Minister is too smart. He knows that GSOC is not answerable to him but to the Oireachtas. However, by sending for the chairman he actively undermined the independence and integrity of that agency. That agency's responsibility is to police the police. It is not that the police are bad but we know to our cost that, human nature being as it is, accountability is necessary in all associations, organisations and institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> Having spoken to the GSOC chairman, the Minister told the Dáil there was nothing there and nothing to see. We then discovered that what the Minister had reported to the Dáil had sizeable omissions from what was sent to him in a written report. Subsequently, on the RTE "Prime Time" programme, Mr. Kieran FitzGerald of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, said that while there may be no definitive evidence of surveillance at the offices, he could not entirely rule it out. At the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, Mr. FitzGerald said he suspected there may have been some form of surveillance carried out in their offices. Later on, it emerged that the security sweeps of the GSOC offices were carried out after it appeared that a senior garda - it is believed by sections of the media that this was indeed the Commissioner - had accessed confidential information about a case which was being investigated by GSOC. Layer upon layer has been added to this story day after day.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> Following repeated calls by Sinn Féin and others for a fully independent inquiry into the bugging scandal, the Government did a partial about-turn a full ten days after the scandal first emerged. Interestingly enough, it was after the publication of Sinn Féin's Private Members' business motion calling for an independent inquiry. The Government appointed retired judge, John Cooke, to carry out a review of the various bits and pieces around. I wish him well but it is our considered opinion that the review under Mr. Justice Cooke is not sufficient. It falls far short of what is required to get to the bottom of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> I am from the North and I know what bad policing is. I lived in a police state for most of my adult life and I am proud to have played a small part in changing that. We need to have a situation where politicians get out of policing matters. Such matters should be administered in an accountable and fully independent way.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> In this case, the Minister should have backed out of it. He should have brought in the type of investigation that is allowed under the Commissions of Investigation Act. The Minister set the terms of reference for Mr. Justice Cooke but the Minister is already at the centre of this entire controversy. He put himself in there, although no one forced him into it. The Minister has already asserted that there was no evidence at all that GSOC was the target of a surveillance operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> In the latest episode of an increasingly worrying saga for members of the public, last week a dossier from the Garda whistleblower, Maurice McCabe, was given to the Taoiseach by the Fianna Fáil leader. That was the right thing to do, as has been recorded. The dossier contained very serious allegations of Garda malpractice.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> These allegations may be totally and absolutely unfounded. I do not know and we have refrained from making any comment on that. Some of us have been on the receiving end of totally unfounded allegations for a very long time. However, these allegations were not new to the Minister for Justice and Equality. Indeed, the allegation is that he has known about them for two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> Yesterday, the Government announced the appointment of a barrister to examine the claims contained in the dossier. Yet again, in my view, that is not enough. I have listened to what the Taoiseach said yesterday and I thought he performed well in terms of how he outlined all this. This, however, is all in marked contrast to the mandate the Government was given when it was elected.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> Last week, I wrote to the Taoiseach asking him to come into the Dáil to make a statement on all these issues. As usual, the Oireachtas was bypassed by the Government. I was able to read about what was going to happen in the Chamber in Monday morning's newspapers. I was able to read what the Minister was going to say, and the general tenor of his approach, in last night's news and in this morning's newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> As I said to the Taoiseach yesterday, if the Minister was not going to hand this over to an independent agency to examine it under the terms of reference which are already set up, he should have come in to this House to talk these issues out, listen to what the Opposition and other Deputies may have had to say and then come up with a position. However, we have been hit with a <i>fait accompli</i>. We were simply told that a senior counsel is going to do a scoping exercise, so the mandate of everyone here amounts to nothing. The Government's focus is on trying to manage public opinion on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">I was not surprised, therefore, when the Minister did not apologise because I knew in advance, as a result of reports in this morning's newspapers and on television last night, that he had no intention of doing so. That is one way of doing business but it is not real politics. It is the politics of spin and throwing shapes as opposed to that of making fundamental changes to the conditions in which people live and to the institutions and protocols by which we are governed.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> I am sure members of the public are fatigued as a result of hearing about the events surrounding this matter over a protracted period. People's mortgages are in distress, their children are in the United States or elsewhere working, some have children in hospital and others cannot gain access to services for their aged parents as a result of the crisis in the area of health. When our parliamentary party meets, I ask my colleagues where the matters under discussion rate among people's concerns. Despite the fact that the other issues I referred to are obviously part of the daily grind for many citizens, there is no doubt that those under discussion also matter to them. In the past five or six years people have learned a great deal about how this State has been run. They respect public servants, including the majority of members of An Garda Síochána. However, they also look to Governments to set matters right. Any charge those in government have levelled at the individuals who preceded them in office is mirrored by the way in which they have gone about dealing with this issue. Even though the allegations that have been made are serious, grave and hugely devastating for the families and others involved, it is the way the Government has responded to them which has caused the crisis in confidence. It is clear - at least for now - that the Government is putting the Minister's interests above that of public confidence. I regularly find myself asking what on earth Labour is doing in government. I just do not know what is its function in the current Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> The reaction to the events surrounding the GSOC scandal and the penalty points affair has been entirely insufficient. The decision to appoint a barrister to review these matters is not good enough either. The only credible and acceptable way to achieve clarity in respect of this chaotic episode and to bring it to a conclusion is through the establishment of an independent inquiry under the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister will not facilitate such an inquiry. If he is as right as he claims to be in respect of these matters, then why will he not establish an independent commission to investigate them? If he did set up a commission, it would mean that there would be no further tit-for-tat exchanges involving himself and Deputy Martin. It would also mean that this would not continue to be an issue of party political points scoring in this Chamber. In addition, it would not become an issue of contention for the members of An Garda Síochána who are out patrolling and looking after our communities, our families and our security.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> I do not understand why the Taoiseach did not come before the House yesterday in order to announce an independent inquiry. Had he done so, he would have shown leadership and removed this matter from the realms of both party politics and politics in general. On numerous occasions I have pointed out that what is happening in this case is symptomatic of a political culture which continues to exist in this State. Corruption does not always involve brown envelopes filled with money. It also involves the way in which people go about their business, cronyism, cosy relationships and operating in a bubble, and not understanding that politics must always be about the empowerment of citizens, upholding their rights and making political conditions better in order that everyone can be treated on the basis of equality. I am of the view that we will find a cure in this regard. The things I refer to are not natural disasters which suddenly came upon us. They are the products of humanity. These are things which we make and which we can unmake. We can certainly make them better if we have the will to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> The way the Government has dealt with this matter is representative of that same old way of doing things. It is also part of the same old culture which those in government pledged to get rid of. That brings me to its treatment of brave people who have come forward. I refer to those who have identified that something is wrong, who have pursued all the proper and legal ways of resolving matters and who want a light to be shone on the various issues about which they are concerned. The people in question are not used to the focus of the media being upon them and neither are they used to public scrutiny. Their families are certainly not used to reading about them in newspapers. It takes very strong individuals to travel the obstacle course that has been erected. I commend those involved in this instance on doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> The Government may only deal with its only electorate but I am of the view that it will find that widespread concern exists among the members of that electorate. People do not want the same old failed ways of doing politics. The Government is aware of this and that is why the parties which comprise it positioned themselves in the way they did in the most recent general election campaign. They knew that people were tired of the activities of those who had preceded them in government. Equally, people are going to become tired of the way in which the Government is dealing with this matter. They want the Government to deal with issues of this nature in an open, transparent and accountable way. The case for establishing an independent inquiry into the bugging scandal, which may or may not be a matter of substance, and the claims relating to the dossier presented by Sergeant Maurice McCabe under the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004 is unanswerable. During his lengthy contribution, the Minister failed to provide one credible reason as to why an inquiry under the Act should not take place. Yesterday, the Taoiseach also failed to provide a single good reason in this regard. In fact, he opined that such a commission may well be set up because that eventuality is implicit in the context of the senior counsel's remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Not long after the Committee of Public Account's hearings on the penalty points scandal, the transcript of a conversation between the confidential recipient, Mr. Oliver Connolly, and Sergeant Maurice McCabe was read into the record of the Dáil. We have all heard it several times. It states: "I tell you something Maurice - and this is just personal advice to you - if Shatter thinks you're screwing him, you're finished." One could not make it up. What prophetic words. We are now faced with the bizarre situation whereby, as a result of what he said about the Minister, Mr. Oliver Connolly's head has been the only one to roll in the aftermath of this series of scandals. The Minister did not utter one word about that matter during his contribution. He unilaterally sacked the man whom he saw fit to appoint to the position of confidential recipient. A public statement was made and it was a case of "Sin é, that's it". The Minister has never advanced any rationale for this decision. Why did he sack Mr. Connolly? What did he do wrong? The Minister is remiss for not even mentioning this matter. If the Government is to have any hope of restoring public confidence in the administration of justice, it must do what we have been advocating. When Deputy Mac Lochlainn has the opportunity to put questions to the Minister on this matter, perhaps he will advance, in a scholarly and appropriate way, the reasons that he has not utilised the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The evidence of the Government's performance is that there is little interest in effective systems of oversight or governance. The Minister earlier dismissed Sinn Féin's concerns on these issues. I remind the Minister that Sinn Féin's mandate from the citizens we represent here cannot be so easily dismissed. Our Oireachtas team is not fazed by the Minister's arrogance and we will continue to hold him to account, I hope, in a fair, but robust and reasonable way. We support the essential role of An Garda Síochána. We have a commitment and we commend the commitment of the overwhelming majority of gardaí who uphold the law and who look after all of us every day. In the North - a place which may be a foreign place for the Minister - Sinn Féin has worked tirelessly to ensure justice and policing is representative of the policing in the communities it seeks to serve. I was one of the people who was primarily involved in that and I can say that if we had not got an independent police authority, local joint policing committees, and an Ombudsman with real power, policing would not have been embraced. The people in the North who support Sinn Féin are law-abiding people, but we did not have a police service that suited the modern needs of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Without seeking to draw any comparisons between the Garda Síochána and the old discredited RUC, it is clear that fundamental change is needed in the administration of policing and justice in this part of Ireland as well. It is very obvious there needs to be a clear separation of Government from the Garda Síochána. No police service, no senior police officer and no Garda Commissioner should be accountable to a politician no matter who that is. It does not matter whether it is Dermot Ahern or Deputy Alan Shatter or Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn. The citizens deserve a policing service which is overseen by an independent authority. The Garda Commissioner should be fully accountable to that authority, as should joint policing committees, and all of that should be accountable to the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Sinn Féin will soon publish its Garda Síochána (amendment) Bill 2014 and we will present our vision for change and our solution to the problems so evident over the past 18 months, namely, the penalty points debacle and the failure of senior Garda management to co-operate fully with the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. As I have said on previous occasions, out of these dark little periods good can come. I commend this Bill to the Minister. Rather than seeking to resist change - I have recorded my admiration for the Minister's reforming zeal on other issues - I ask him to embrace it. The Minister should be in the vanguard of this change. His first step should have been to establish independent inquiries into GSOC and whistleblower scandals as provided for under the Commissions of Investigation Act. This has been the Minister's greatest failure. He is not a stupid person. It is not the allegations of misconduct by some gardaí that has eroded public confidence, it is his and the Government's failure to deal with these matters properly, fairly and in a transparent way. The Minister is bound to know that.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">I find the Government's proposal to appoint a senior counsel to consider whether an independent inquiry is required a bit difficult to take after all that has happened. After 18 months of the penalty points episode we certainly have no doubts that an independent public inquiry is required to establish the truth - an independent and public inquiry into the penalty points episode, into the allegations of surveillance of GSOC, and into reported malpractice and corruption in the force over a long period.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> One does not need to be a rocket scientist to assume that justice is not being administered fairly in this country. I am not saying it was before the Minister's time, I am saying it is still happening on his watch. From when the whistleblowers first brought forward their information, the Minister's first instinct was to rubbish them. We brought the information to the Chamber and he rubbished us. He set up a report and he had the Garda Commissioner rubbish that on 7 December 2012. It was a case of minimise, dismiss and rubbish all the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> We eventually got the internal reports and we issued an 18 page document to highlight the inadequacies of a report which was the result of gardaí inspecting gardaí. The Minister rubbished us again. He attacked us personally and he went his usual way of dismissing and minimising anyone who had the audacity to challenge him. </p>
          <p eId="para_157"> The Garda professional standards unit report contained some good recommendations and the Minister decided to pick out the ones he liked and to forget the ones he did not like so much. The main recommendation was the publication of a fixed charge manual within three months, but this has not been implemented. Perhaps it is on the way. It recommended an independent audit but we got an internal one. The Garda Commissioner came to the joint committee to tell us that the result of the audit was 100% perfect. It reminded me of Mugabe. The report recommended a separate investigation into the abuse of the mandatory comment box because this was at the heart of how the penalty points system corroded. This has not happened either.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> The Minister did not cover himself in glory on "Prime Time"; what he said was personal and political. He knows it had nothing to do with him as Minister administering his ministry of justice in a proper manner. It was interesting to hear some of the recent comments about his reservations with regard to the policing Bill. We brought forward a Bill to address many of the issues which have come into the public domain of late. We considered the idea of an independent board with monitoring and supervisory oversight functions. The Minister rubbished it. We looked at the idea of a diffusion of power and the depoliticisation of the police. The Garda Commissioner is answerable to the Dáil, which amounts to nothing because in reality he is only answerable to the Minister, who is one man from one party. Policing in Ireland is over-politicised. We recommended a root and branch review of the force, something that has never happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> I refer to what the Minister said in reply to our recommendations:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_160">The 2005 Act provides that the Commissioner is accountable to the Minister for the performance of his functions and those of the force. In turn, as Minister, I am accountable to this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">If that is the case, I am surprised he is still here:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_162">In terms of accountability, it is worthwhile recording that in addition to the Minister of the day being answerable to the House for the Garda Síochána, the Garda Commissioner is, under the 2005 Act, the Accounting Officer for the Garda Síochána. In that capacity he is liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. In addition, the 2005 Act established the independent Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission which is empowered to carry out independent investigations into Garda conduct. That Act also established the Garda Síochána Inspectorate which provides expert advice on achieving the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">I remind the Minister that it states, "the highest levels".</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The Minister further stated that the accountability of the Garda Síochána has been significantly strengthened by means of all these measures. The Minister told us then that oversight was in safe hands and everything was well. Now he is telling us that some modifications are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Perhaps he will now consider that he may have got it wrong when he rubbished the Bill I brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> The GSOC Boylan report and its annual report last summer were both damning of the lack of co-operation the commission received from the Garda Síochána. GSOC observed that many of the recommendations set out in the Morris report of 2004 had not been implemented and, moreover, that the sorry tale of Garda involvement in the Kieran Boylan affair bore a striking resemblance to the goings on in Donegal that led to the establishment of the Morris tribunal. The Garda Commissioner completely dismissed the seriousness of GSOC's special report when he appeared before the Oireachtas committee. He relied heavily on the excuse of safeguarding State security and combatting terrorism when defending some of the force's unorthodox actions and the clandestine nature of those actions. Security concerns, he stated, might sometimes prevent him from co-operating with the oversight mechanism of GSOC. Where have we heard that before?</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> The Commissioner also defended the Garda practice of demanding to know the relevance of GSOC's requests for information before it will agree to provide that information. There is absolutely no legal reason that GSOC should have to explain why the evidence it is seeking is relevant to any investigation it is undertaking. The new protocol arrangement the Minister introduced last September, which was supposed to improve the exchange of information between the Garda and GSOC, was only soft law and involves no element of compulsion. It is another example of weak application of the law. The Commissioner came in and told us we should have trust and confidence in him and that he will give GSOC information when he sees fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> It gets worse and worse. The Minister would not let GSOC investigate the Roma children affair, deciding instead that it would make more sense to have a weaker review. There will not be any examination of Garda racial profiling under the terms of reference he has given the Ombudsman for Children. The Minister came in here and rubbished the local people who protested at the Corrib gas field. There were more complaints to GSOC about that operation than about any other issue in the history of the State. When we asked the Minister to give GSOC the task of examining what was happening there under section 106 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, he was not interested in the truth. His concern was with covering up, minimising and dismissing.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> The Fine Gael Party used to pride itself on being the party of law and order. How in God's name can it stand over that? The Minister avoids using strong legislation in order to avoid seeking out the truth and having to reveal it. He would not ask the Commissioner if the latter had engaged in lawful surveillance in case he was told something he had to stand over. He would not put the same questions to G2. He would not even ask whether any effort had been made to check for rogue elements within the force in general or G2 in particular who might have engaged in unlawful surveillance. The Minister did not want the answers to these questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> GSOC made strenuous requests for access to the PULSE system last September in the wake of the Boylan report and its annual report. The Minister refused to grant it, before finally relenting a few weeks ago under political pressure. He would not allow GSOC to examine the penalty points issue until, again under political pressure, he allowed an investigation under section 102, but not section 106, of he 2005 Act. The Minister's prime motive in all of this is political survival. Sad to say, his prime motives have very little to do with the administration of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> Many things have gone on in this State for a long time that leave much to be desired. They were happening long before the Minister's time, but it is disappointing that there is still no appetite for the truth. Gemma O'Doherty lost her job at the <i>Irish Independent</i> because she had the audacity to challenge the Commissioner. We received an e-mail this morning from a nephew of Fr. Niall Molloy, the priest whose murder has been the subject of extensive research by Ms O'Doherty. He states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_172">For almost 30 years people have hidden behind a wall of silence, deceit, corruption and cover-up. Time for the light of justice to shine on them and reveal them to the people for what they are. Many, many people have gone to their graves overshadowed by this heartache.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> If the Minister stays in power and the Commissioner remains in place, then this Parliament is a sham.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">People are right to be cynical about politics and politicians. This place is a joke. We play games in here, and sometimes these games lead to the unfair distribution of justice or no justice at all. Sometimes they lead to people losing their lives, to murders, to families not getting any justice. What do we see when bad things emerge? We see our police force and our politicians circling the wagons and doing what it takes to cover up what they do not want us to see. They do what it takes to hide the truth. Is there any appetite for doing things any differently in this House? The Minister looks up at these benches and wonders how those people, with their long hair and raggy jeans, have the audacity to challenge him. The people of Wexford did not elect me to come in here and approve of the Minister's behaviour. They put me in here to challenge it. It is time for the Minister to go and to bring the Commissioner with him.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">Today we have a case of here we go again, with Dáil business suspended while the Minister for Justice and Equality comes in to explain himself. I really wonder how long it will take for the penny to drop and for backbenchers in Fine Gael and the Labour Party to join the dots and realise we have a serious problem in this country. That problem is twofold. First, we are not dealing with isolated examples but rather with an institutional problem. Second, that problem patently will not be dealt with while the Minister remains in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> The Minister has come in here today and twittered away to his friend sitting beside him. He has gone on the attack in an attempt to deflect. We heard that there is no basis to the allegations made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe, just as we were told there was no basis to allegations regarding surveillance of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. In that case, we had the Minister referring to "so-called vulnerabilities". He tells us he does not have any animosity towards Garda McCabe, but he spent most of his contribution trying to undermine the latter, in much the same way as he hold us he was a great supporter of GSOC while every action he has taken has been either to accuse the commission of not fulfilling its statutory duty or an attempt to undermine it at every turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> The Minister spent a great deal of time in his opening statement saying it was not true that the original complaints made by Garda McCabe were not investigated. In fact, he assured us, they were all investigated. The Minister is 100% correct in that. However, they were investigated under procedures which were found demonstrably to be inadequate. We had the Garda investigating itself, a toothless GSOC and a confidential recipient role that was not fit for purpose. These procedures were inadequate to deal with the penalty points issue and are likewise inadequate to deal with all of the other allegations. The Minister thinks he can get away from this reality by deflecting, but he cannot do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> The authors of the Morris tribunal report referred to being staggered by a small but disproportionately influential core of people in the Garda Síochána. We were told at the time that measures were being brought in to deal with this. It has been clear for some time, however, that the measures that were implemented have not dealt with the problems. Those of us who have been raising these points for some time were, until very recently, ridiculed for so doing. We were met with passionate speeches about how crime is being reduced and the work of the many great gardaí in the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Of course there are great gardaí out there, but they too need a transparent Garda force. In my opinion, there is a small but disproportionately influential core in the force. I refer to those among whom "loyalty [to the force] is prized above honesty", as Judge Smithwick identified. This attitude is epitomised by the antics of the Garda Commissioner, who called the whistleblowers "disgusting". He referred to them as "so-called whistleblowers" and said he would not allow them to undermine his officers. This mentality views the force as separate from the interests of the public it is supposed to serve. If that link is to be broken down, the political will to make the Garda so do will be required. Unfortunately, the nature of the relationship between the Minister and the Garda Commissioner is making that impossible. It is a key part of the problem. It is genuinely hard to see how we can move on when this fairly gigantic elephant is in the room. This needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Every one of this Government's responses has been too little, too late. It took the Government 18 months to appoint GSOC to investigate the penalty points issue. Its response to the surveillance of GSOC was to initiate an inquiry into GSOC rather than the alleged source of the surveillance. Now it is setting up an inquiry to see whether we need an inquiry. To be honest, the issues have gone way too far for that. Of course we need a proper commission of inquiry into everything that has gone on over the last while. That is actually the easy bit. The more difficult bit, and the more necessary bit, is that alluded to by Deputy Wallace - the urgent legislative reform that is needed in this regard. When we highlighted what was needed last summer, the Minister basically laughed us out of court, although he has now adopted some of our points. He does not need to bring these issues to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. GSOC has already told the Minister what it needs, but he has ignored it. The recommendations that GSOC issued on foot of the Kieran Boylan report have not yet been implemented. More important, the idea that the Minister and Commissioner Callinan can remain at the helm is unsustainable at this stage. I do not say that lightly. I am not saying it on the basis of jumping to conclusions. I am saying it on the basis of my knowledge of the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> The Minister said that Sergeant Maurice McCabe's allegations of malpractice and serious corruption in the area of Bailieborough, County Cavan were investigated. He pointed out that "not everything is simply black and white" and that is true. What is black and white is that Sergeant Maurice McCabe was demonised, bullied, discredited and moved out of that station. What is black and white is that Sergeant Maurice McCabe was told there was no case to answer in cases in which there are clearly questions to be answered. I am not saying that any garda wanted something like the tragic murder of Sylvia Roche Kelly to happen. Clearly, that is not the case. Clearly, it is good that her murderer is in prison. The point that people are making is that it is an awful pity that he was not in prison before he murdered her. He could have been in prison if gardaí had done their jobs properly. It was decided to shoot the messenger rather than deal with the consequences of these actions or inactions. Luckily for Irish society, this messenger was made of sterner stuff. Sergeant Maurice McCabe did not back down despite the enormous personal consequences that had for him. The difference with the penalty points case was that it was possible to prove what went on there. Even in that case, it was a massive battle over 18 months. Sergeant McCabe went to every arm of the State to get answers and only then did we get them. It showed his credibility and meant that the other allegations were now being listened to, which was hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> I am glad that Fianna Fáil has stood up and woken up to this issue. I am glad that others who have not said a word about this issue since it started are going to speak about it now. I am glad that people are learning about the seriousness of this issue. However, it is clear from the Minister's antics here today that he does not appreciate how serious this issue is. He is taking the exact same approach that he took to the penalty points issue. In that case, we were told there was no systems problem. The Minister told us that just 189 allegations had been made and that half of them were wrong anyway. Now we hear that a load of allegations have been made, but there is probably nothing to them. That is wrong. We can say that because we know what has happened in so many other instances. The Taoiseach received a letter this week from Ian Bailey on foot of his request for others with evidence of malpractice to come forward. As the Minister knows, five Supreme Court judges have said that the behaviour of gardaí in relation to Ian Bailey was wrongful and breathtaking misconduct. The gardaí in question offered a drug user £5,000 and drugs to incriminate Ian Bailey. The garda who was named in the DPP's report as having done that was sent to France to advise the French authorities on the criminality of Ian Bailey.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">We know that in 2012, ten gardaí were appointed to investigate the tragic case of Fr. Niall Molloy on foot of new information from Gemma O'Doherty. Guess what they found? Nothing. They found no evidence and no prosecutions were brought. I might add that no one spoke to Gemma O'Doherty either. Those involved in internal investigations are obviously fond of not interviewing the person who brings new information to light. I could also mention our own cases. People the length and breadth of this country contacted us on foot of the work we did originally. In October of last year, we went to the Department of Justice and Equality with almost 30 citizens who wished to hand in details of tragic cases of Garda malpractice that resulted in citizens of this State failing to achieve justice. We did not know if all of those allegations were true, but we knew that the people in question sincerely believed them to be true. The citizens who wanted to hand in their details, who had an average age of approximately 60, and four Deputies from this House were locked out of the Department of Justice and Equality. We had to negotiate on the telephone to get the door open. There is a problem of culture here.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> The Minister's relationship with the Garda Commissioner is at the heart of it. In his speech here today, the Minister spent some time dealing with his allegation, which can be disproven, that Sergeant Maurice McCabe and Garda John Wilson did not co-operate with the investigation. He said they failed to take up an invitation from John O'Mahoney to engage with his inquiry. That is a bit peculiar because John O'Mahoney said clearly at a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, in response to a question from Deputy McDonald, that he did not invite Sergeant Maurice McCabe to participate in that process. The Minister is just wrong. I think one of the reasons he is wrong - I would take issue with Deputy Martin in this regard - is that he leans too much on the information given to him by the Garda Commissioner at every turn. The only so-called evidence that Sergeant Maurice McCabe or Garda John Wilson did not co-operate with the inquiry is the so-called directive that was issued by the Garda Commissioner on 14 December 2012. I want to put it on the record that this directive was no more than a demand to shut up and back off. No other explanation will tally.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Everybody is talking about this issue now, but it was not always so popular. I want to put Deputies back in the minds of certain people. An internal investigation was set up at the end of October. Five chief superintendents, six superintendents, seven office staff and all of their other staff met over a seven-month period. They were sitting up there for a month without coming near any of the whistleblowers. Deputy Wallace suddenly used a sleight of hand to ask a question that was not on the agenda - our questions had been ruled out of order - and put this matter on the Dáil record. The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, answered him in that regard and fair play to him for that. It became a story when "Prime Time" ran with it. What happened next? The whistleblowers were sitting in their base two days later when a confidential circular was posted on the notice board. It said that in order to protect the reputation of An Garda Síochána, anybody who accessed the PULSE system would be audited and anybody who released information would be investigated. The following day, the Garda Commissioner released a press statement saying there was no culture of writing off penalty points. A couple of days later, the whistleblowers were called in and told not to access PULSE. They were not allowed to take a copy of the letter - it was read out to them. They were told to stop accessing those records. Garda John Wilson had his car searched by his colleagues. Another directive was issued a couple of days later. It was not a direction to participate with the inquiry - it was a further direction to stop accessing PULSE. If that <i>modus operandi</i> did not represent an attempt to shut down the inquiry, I do not know what it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has been at pains to put a divide between the operational responsibility of An Garda Síochána and his responsibilities in the policy area. All I can detect from that is that the Minister's friend, Commissioner Callinan, will be joining his previous friend, Oliver Connolly, among the ranks of the unemployed and that the Minister intends to soldier on to the end of this controversy.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">I am heartily sick of this situation. I am disgusted by the Minister's antics, his behaviour today and his behaviour in the past. I do not want to be part of a society that stands over this type of cover-up and I do not believe Irish citizens do either. The Minister might think he has got away with it, but he has not.</p>

          <p eId="para_195">Yesterday in the House the Taoiseach announced the appointment of a senior counsel to deal with very serious issues pertaining to a dossier I sent him. I welcome that and I hope for at least an inquiry. However, I ask the Taoiseach to intervene in one aspect of the saga and try to bring it to some meaningful solution. It relates to the assertion and allegation on the floor of the House that the whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe, and Mr. Wilson did not co-operate with the investigation conducted by the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Mahoney, into the penalty points saga. When a serious allegation of non-co-operation against a serving garda is made on the floor of the House, it either needs to be stood up or withdrawn with an apology made to the person.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> I have gone through this at great length. The Minister's speech this morning does not deal with that aspect of it in any comprehensive or adequate way. The Road Safety Authority made it clear to the Minister that it regarded it as a major failing that he was not interviewed and, in fact, communicated that to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, I believe in the presence of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar. When it was asked for its views on the inquiry, it sent its views to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, outlining that this was the major failing of the penalty points inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Based on the record of the Committee of Public Accounts, it seems that the only person in the entire system who made the accusation that Sergeant McCabe did not co-operate was the Minister, Deputy Shatter. To be fair, the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Mahoney, did not make that assertion. When the Commissioner was pressed by Deputy McDonald at a committee meeting, he said: </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_198">When I was responding to Deputy Ross, I did so in the context of whether these people had been interviewed. The report from the Assistant Commissioner, having looked at the allegations and established the facts, did not see a need [to interview these people] on the basis that the Assistant Commissioner had not uncovered criminality. Therefore, there was no need to defer to the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, had it been the case that he saw clear evidence, or even a suspicion, of corruption or malpractice within the allegations he had before him, I presume that would have triggered those people being interviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">No one along the way has ever suggested that he was interviewed or that he did not co-operate. The only person was the Minister. He has gone to great lengths to try to justify that but it does not stack up. The simple way out of this would be to have that very serious claim of non-co-operation withdrawn. That would be the simplest way out of it. It would bring some resolution and clear the person's name. The person is anxious that his name be cleared.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">The House is discussing a serious matter and a serious process has been put in place to deal with matters outlined in documents the Deputy gave me last week. At that time I said I believed he was right to give me those documents, and he was correct in doing that. It does not mean he was right in everything else, from my point of view, in his charges about maladministration and incompetence on behalf of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> The Minister, Deputy Shatter, set out this morning the chronology of events that happened here, the action that had been taken by him on receiving the documentation in the Department of Justice and Equality, and the follow-through on that, arising out of which came the O'Mahoney investigation being put in place. The Minister tried very hard to set out here his understanding-----</p>

          <p eId="para_212">----- of what the connections and the communication to Sergeant McCabe were. Obviously Sergeant McCabe had a different perspective on that. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, will be answering questions again at the end of this series of statements. I welcome the statement from Sergeant McCabe in respect of the process that is now in place. Deputy Martin asked me the question yesterday, and I reiterate for him that the senior counsel will engage directly with Sergeant McCabe in this matter, which is of considerable importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Members may now have their say during the course of statements today and the Minister will answer questions at the end of that. We now have a criminal lawyer to look at and assess the investigative methods and bring back a recommendation, hopefully before Easter. Let us see what that is. It also means direct engagement with Sergeant McCabe in regard to the matters Deputy Martin presented to me, which in part have been investigated either by the Commissioner, GSOC or in some references to the DPP.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> The Minister has set out his point of view, including the communications and chronology of events as followed by him. People often have differences of opinion about what statements can actually mean. The Minister has dealt with this in his statement this morning and again yesterday.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. The Minister has not dealt with it this morning and, of course, we got a copy of his speech very late in the day during the delivery of his speech - I think for obvious reasons. He said that he relied on material that he received, detailing the content of a direction given to Sergeant McCabe on a related matter. No one has ever said and no one is saying that the inquiry team ever invited Sergeant Maurice McCabe to anything. It did not text him, e-mail him or interview him. That is a fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> The Minister is now relying on one letter from an assistant secretary, which again did not invite him to any inquiry or whatever and only advised him to bring information to what was described as "his authorities". He said: "The situation is further complicated by the fact that between the finalisation of the O'Mahoney report and its publication, he declined to take up an offer from assistant commissioner O'Mahoney". It was not between the finalisation and publication of that. That conversation took place in the aftermath of the report having been sent to the Minister. The bottom line is that he was not asked and the Commissioner said at the Committee of Public Accounts that he was not asked.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">A whole range of opinions and evidence would suggest the Minister was wrong in saying what he said. Sometimes it is much simpler to simply acknowledge that.

          <p eId="para_222">He was not invited in any shape or form to be interviewed by the O'Mahoney inquiry team, as the Commissioner said on the record of the Committee of Public Accounts when pressed by Deputies McDonald, Ross and others. It was very clear. This has become an issue because the Minister made a big mistake in saying that in the House. Everybody now has to track all over the place and trawl everywhere to see if they can get some document or something that defends what the Minister said in the House. It is only undermining the credibility of all the other actors in this saga.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">The Deputy, as the leader of his party, understands that it has not worked in the way that people might have expected, so we have to change it, and these events have happened. It is also important that the Minister spelt out his series of actions in response to the charges that he did nothing following the material being received in the Department of Justice and Equality. The Minister is not one to deliberately mislead this House, no more than any other Minister - that is a serious charge. </p>

          <p eId="para_266">-----of the very serious matters that were raised about assaults and other elements of allegations of misconduct, incompetence or poor behaviour by gardaí. The bigger picture that the Deputy Martin and everyone else wants is that we have a Garda force that is transparent, accountable and competent and that the oversight body of GSOC can be reformed in a way that reflects that accurately for the citizens of our country.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">I want to put three issues to the Taoiseach followed by a question, all arising from the statement made today by the Minister, Deputy Shatter. The fact is, and Teachta Martin has dealt with this to some degree, that the Minister accused Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe of not co-operating. That is clear. He did not take the opportunity to rectify that during his statement. In the Committee of Public Accounts in response to a question by Teachta Mary Lou McDonald, John O'Mahoney responded that he did not interview Maurice McCabe and he did not seek to interview Maurice McCabe - so it is clear. There was an opportunity for the Minister to rectify that and he did not do so. I now ask the Taoiseach to consider doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> Second, the Minister did not even mention the sacking of the confidential recipient - the only head to roll. Could some explanation be given to this Oireachtas as to why this man was sacked? </p>
          <p eId="para_269"> Finally, because we did not get this clear yesterday, could the Taoiseach outline to me and explain to the Dáil why he did not establish an independent inquiry under the Commission of Investigations Act 2004 when he has at his disposal legislation which he could have utilised and when he has an Act whereby the person or persons appointed to conduct an investigation can compel all witnesses and documentation and make findings of fact without huge cost and in a timely fashion? I put this question to the Minister earlier but I ask the Taoiseach why did he himself not act in this manner? Why does the Government not set up an independent inquiry under the terms that are provided under the 2004 Act? Those are the three issues to which I would ask him to respond.</p>

          <p eId="para_271">In respect of the question that Deputy Martin asked, I referred to Garda Sergeant McCabe's own words when he spoke to Assistant Commissioner, John O'Mahoney, when he was invited to make a contribution or information that he had available to the investigation team. He said he ended the call because he was alarmed that the assistant commissioner wanted to speak to someone on the investigation team, and that was before the report was published. Deputy Adams, like Deputy Martin, is focusing on a specific issue here. The bigger elements concern the material Deputy Michael Martin gave me, and he was right to give that to me because of the serious nature of the allegations.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> Deputy Adams asked me why did we not set up a special investigation commission immediately. The truth of the matter is that a number of these bodies are completely independent of this House. GSOC is independent of the House. It was set up for a particular purpose, that of receiving complaints from citizens or in the case of gardaí who wished to make a complaint about elements in the force and that this could be done through the confidential recipient process. That has not worked. The Government approved an amendment to change the law in this regard - that gardaí or serving members can go directly to GSOC, which is utterly independent of this House, as is the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, over which I have no authority, nor has the Deputy, nor has this House. In respect of the matters that were investigated by the Garda Commissioner, in some cases by the Director of Public Prosecutions, or in some cases by GSOC, two of those are completely independent bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> It is only right and proper that there should be the scoping exercise, to which the Government has agreed, as happened in the case of the scoping exercise in regard to the Morris tribunal. A similar instance arose when the Minister for Health initiated an inquiry in respect of the very serious matters that arose regarding the maternity situation in Portlaoise hospital. This scoping exercise can inform the Minister as to the need for a formal investigation or otherwise. In this case the decision of the Government will bring into focus the assessment of the investigative process that was followed arising from the allegations. </p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Deputy Martin gave me his documentation from Sergeant McCabe and one of the issues is an allegation that a garda perjured himself in court and was berated by the judge. That was part of a case that was brought to our attention. What was the outcome? Did this go the Director of Public Prosecutions, was there an independent decision, an investigation by the Garda Commissioner followed by the allegation from Sergeant McCabe? That is why it is necessary to have a proper scoping exercise by a qualified, competent person who can put all this in coherent manner and make a recommendation to me as Taoiseach for presentation to the Oireachtas. If that recommendation is that there be a requirement for a special investigation commission, then that is what will happen. That is clear. I believe it was the right and prudent thing to do, in view of all of the documentation, all of the reports, all of the allegations and all of the investigations that have taken place, to put that process in place and bring clarity and truth to it. That will enable us to focus on the serious issues that Deputy Michael Martin brought to my attention following the presentation to the Deputy Adams from Sergeant McCabe.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">Of course the allegations in the dossier are very serious but they are allegations. They are deeply wounding and traumatic for the victims' families and we need to appreciate all of that, but it is the Government's handling of these allegations which has caused the erosion of public confidence. If the Taoiseach misses that, he misses everything. We end up operating here in a bubble, impervious to the concerns of the citizens. The fact is that the Minister had the opportunity to set the record straight around the accusation that Maurice McCabe did not co-operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">It is without question that the Minister miscalled that. He should be man enough to own up to that and, rather than defending him, the Taoiseach should have a word in his ear after this to try to rectify that particular element.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> It may not be the most important element but we are in the public eye and we are used to the blizzard of media controversy that sometimes surrounds us. These are serving garda who are not used to, as their families are not used to, this type of treatment. I am not impressed or persuaded by the Taoiseach's defence of not going for the type of independent inquiry under the Commissions of Investigation Act that he has the ability to go for. He could have done that but he has decided not to. As we tell each other all the time here, politics is all about choice. The Taoiseach decided not to go for that option.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> The Taoiseach also decided not to answer my question about the sacking of the confidential recipient. Summarily, he came to the House one day and announced that the guy was gone. Could we have an explanation? I was sent here by citizens who want me to represent their views. They are wondering what happened to this person. Could it be one of those strange ironies that he said to the-----</p>

          <p eId="para_283">Yes, it is called truth. The position is that the confidential recipient was appointed for a particular job - to receive confidential information from serving members of the Garda for transmission to the Commissioner or to the Minister for Justice and Equality. When the transcript arose of an alleged conversation that took place between the confidential recipient and Sergeant Maurice McCabe, the situation was that the Minister saw to it that the Department of Justice and Equality contacted the confidential recipient to see whether this was true. The allegations contained in the transcript were outrageous.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">In respect of the Minister's intentions, or rather the remarks about the Minister's possible intentions with a view to following through if confidential information was given. As the confidential recipient did not answer the question about whether he said these words, and if this was what he said, we could not have a situation where, without answering those straight questions, somebody could continue in that position. For that reason, his position became untenable. That is the answer to the Deputy's question.</p>

          <p eId="para_292">It is quite clear that an investigation into an investigation is going to continue. However, what is also very clear is that there is an aggressive reluctance by senior gardaí to accept any form of meaningful accountability over what Garda Commissioner Callinan refers to as his force. This is the nub of the matter. It is also clear that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has backed senior gardaí in this attitude. The real problem here is that an ordinary member of the public who has a complaint against the Garda or an individual garda faces, at best, an insurmountable set of obstacles in having their complaint taken seriously and properly investigated. At worst, they find themselves the target of harassment and intimidation, wrongful arrest, vexatious charges and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I refer to a particular case and I will then put a question to the Taoiseach. I am aware of the 30 cases that were put to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, in October last by Justice for All. One of those involved Dr. Richard O'Flaherty, who was a nominated doctor in the Limerick area for both the Garda and the Prison Service for 40 years. He would be called to the Garda station to treat people under arrest. He had concerns about the maltreatment of patients in the Garda station, including beatings and denial of medical attention. He raised these issues on occasion when giving evidence in court. This brought him into conflict with certain gardaí and, at present, there is a GSOC investigation into allegations made by Dr. O'Flaherty of harassment and intimidation, including a serious assault by gardaí against him personally. It took two years, 12 letters and the expense of hiring a solicitor to convince GSOC to appoint a civil investigator. When someone in this situation faces such difficulty, what hope is there for ordinary citizens?</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a problem of culture at the top. This is an opportunity for the Taoiseach and the Government to deal with the situation. Will the Taoiseach establish an independent police authority? Such an authority would appoint a Garda Commissioner, with the Commissioner to be accountable to the authority. Will he properly resource GSOC with real powers to investigate complaints, a commitment to investigate all complaints and put an end to gardaí investigating gardaí? Will he bring proper protection for whistleblowers and, just as important, protection of citizens who exercise their right to make complaints?</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> It is time to deal with this decisively. Otherwise, as we have been talking about it in the past and we are talking about it in the present, we will be talking about it into the future. The fundamentals have to be changed. The Taoiseach is in a position to do it. Will he do it?</p>

          <p eId="para_296">Deputy Joan Collins cannot have it both ways. For the last number of weeks, she was complaining that the Minister for Justice and Equality was impacting on GSOC, which is completely independent. Now, she is telling me that GSOC is not able to do its job. I cannot second-guess what an independent investigative authority will do in regard to any case that comes before it. It is not for the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Government or anybody else to tell it what to do. We have had GSOC in before the committee at length. Last week, the allegation was that the Government or the Minister for Justice and Equality were attempting to do down GSOC in its independence. Now, the Deputy is telling me something entirely different, namely, that it is unable to do its job. The Minister for Justice and Equality has pointed out that the resources and powers in regard to GSOC are going to be improved, because it has been there for a number of years and, clearly, there are inadequacies.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> I received the letter from Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, Deputy Joan Collins, Deputy Mick Wallace and Deputy Clare Daly. They set out about Justice for All and that they handed in documents from 22 members of a group on 17 October last. They said these affidavits documented malpractice and inadequate work by gardaí. I assume these are on behalf of citizens as distinct from members of the force. The range of issues went from quite minor cases of bullying and harassment by gardaí to failure to investigate murder.</p>

They say that since that time, nothing has happened and they are bringing to my attention further inadequacies within the Garda ombudsman's office. They say that, as was pointed out during the debate on the Garda ombudsman Bill last July, GSOC is inadequately founded in legislation. That is why the Government asked Deputy Stanton and his committee to take public hearings, including from Deputy Joan Collins and anybody else, about the inadequacies of the legislation-----</p>

          <p eId="para_302"> I point out to the Deputy that the handing in of the 24 submissions to the Department by members of the delegation arose from a Private Members' Bill here in July 2013 on an amendment to the Garda Síochána Act of 2005, during which it was alleged that a number of individuals believed their complaints to GSOC had not been investigated. GSOC is an independent authority. The Minister offered to review the handling of the specific complaints with regard to individuals who believed their matters were not properly investigated or are making allegations of misconduct against members of the Garda. The 24 submissions were acknowledged upon receipt on 17 October 2013 and officials in the Department were given the task of undertaking a detailed examination of the cases to ascertain whether the individuals concerned had availed of the proper mechanisms for consideration of their case.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Some of these complaints go back a number of years, some relate to bodies other than the Garda Síochána and some covered a range of other matters. I can confirm to the Deputy that the examination of the 24 submissions took quite some time to deal with. It is now finalised and it is planned that these replies will issue to each of the 24 individuals in the very near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">I do not know where the Taoiseach has been for the past period of time but even GSOC has said that it does not have the powers that are needed to investigate independently matters. There has been and will continue to be a culture regarding this issue unless fundamental legislation is introduced to separate the powers of the State and the powers of a body doing its job. We have seen the Fr. Niall Molloy cover up. The journalist who re-investigated it, Gemma O'Doherty, was never even asked to go to that investigation. This is another situation where the person involved has not been brought into an investigative process. Will the Taoiseach establish an independent police authority? This is what is needed. Will such an authority appoint the Garda Commissioner and will the Garda Commissioner be accountable to the authority? These fundamental questions were included in the legislation brought forward by Deputy Wallace last year and need to be addressed. This subject should be discussed.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I am not sure where the Deputy has been for the past while because GSOC is an independent entity set up for the specific purpose of dealing with complaints from members of the public against serving members of the gardaí. The Deputy is now telling me that GSOC does not have the powers to investigate the complaints that were made. That is what I understand her to be saying. That is what GSOC was set up for and that is why it is independent. The confidential recipient process will now end when the legislation is brought in with the opportunity for members of the gardaí who have complaints against serving members to go directly to GSOC.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> Deputy Wallace mentioned the Boylan case. GSOC made recommendations and reports in respect of the gardaí arising from that report. Deputy Wallace also mentioned the matter of protocols which the Minister addressed last September when he instructed that new procedures in respect of some of the protocols be brought in. I say to Deputy Collins that we all want this to work very effectively. I advise her and the other Deputies to go to the Staunton committee and point out where this is inadequately founded in legislation and where they think it can be improved. That is what the public engagement process is about and that is why I expect that former Commissioner Brady will be able to go before that committee and address where the legislation is inadequate from his point of view as a former commission member. The Minister will address that. We want this to work and for GSOC to be seen to have the resources, investigative authority, the legislation to back it up and the protection for whistleblowers. We also want the Garda Síochána, which protects the public from criminal elements, to be seen to be transparent and accountable and for there to be proper oversight there so that everybody can feel comfortable and safe in that knowledge.</p>

I listened with interest this morning to the chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, raise the possibility of the Government bringing forward legislation to deal with this issue in terms of creating a statutory framework whereby the purchasers of the loan book would come under the statutory code of conduct, including the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman. I know that Deputy Michael McGrath has tabled legislation to that effect. Given the urgency of this, will the Taoiseach give Government time to allow that Bill to be debated and to indicate whether he intends to publish legislation in line with the comments of Deputy Lynch this morning? Prospective buyers are now asked to comply voluntarily with the codes. Will that be included within a statutory framework?</p>

          <p eId="para_310">I listened to Deputy Donnelly last week saying that all these mortgage holders were going to be sold down the Swanee with the process that is being followed here. The Minister dealt with this on a number of occasions because the liquidator has a responsibility in terms of the creditors. The Minister pointed out that were he to interfere in the process, he could be open to legal challenge from other elements in the system. I am glad to note that the potential bidders have said that they will sign up voluntarily to the extra codes set down by the Central Bank. That is obviously an important issue for those who are among the block of 13,000 mortgage holders. I will ask the Minister to reflect on the point made by Deputy Martin and to see whether it is possible to legislate for that given that he has already said formally that were he to attempt to interfere in the process, the liquidator having a duty to the creditors could make him subject to legal challenge.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">I asked about voting rights for Irish citizens living overseas when I raised the programme for Government commitment on the Constitutional Convention with the Taoiseach yesterday. The Taoiseach told me that the deadline for dealing with the recommendations of the convention was six months. My understanding is that it is four months and the convention's fourth report on Dáil electoral reform makes some very important recommendations. They include increasing minimum constituency size and establishing an independent electoral commission. That was published in August 2013 so that is a long time ago. Can the Taoiseach clarify whether it is six months or four months and when that report on electoral reform will be dealt with?</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> In respect of the Health Reform Bill, I do not know if the Taoiseach saw the report in <i>The Lancet</i> which said that among other things, there was a direct link between patient risk and staffing cuts. According to Professor Anne Scott who led the Irish arm of the study, "the assumption that hospital nurse staffing can be reduced to save money without adversely affecting patient outcomes may be misguided at best, and fatal at worst." Will this Bill take into account the fact that the safety of patients is decreased and the burden on nurses increased because of cuts and will there be an opportunity to debate that in this Chamber? </p>

          <p eId="para_315">In respect of the latter point, 700 nurses were recruited and employed last year. Of course, there will be an opportunity to discuss all these matters in terms of the publication of the universal health insurance paper, which will deal with a range of issues that arise as one changes from a two-tier to a one-tier system. I must admit that the report referred to by Deputy Adams should have been dealt with in four months.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">It was due in, I think, by December. That deadline was not met; I admit that. It was probably due to the rush of legislation, the exit from the bailout, the budget and all of the rest of it. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is considering its views on it. I will give Deputy Adams an up-to-date report as to when we can expect it to come to Government, make our views known and debate that report of the convention here also. My apologies for not meeting the timeline. There were reasons for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">I am loath to raise this matter again but, given the fact that issues relating to bail and its ready availability seem to be in the public arena in respect of other matters discussed in the Chamber today, and also given that I have raised this issue consistently for the past three years and, prior to that, for ten years in opposition, might it be possible to bring the relevant legislation before the House as a matter of extreme urgency?

          <p eId="para_323">The Taoiseach mentioned the debate on his plans essentially to hand the health service over to private insurance companies. He did not state exactly when that would begin. Also, he used that issue to deflect from the stark findings of a report showing that the number of patient deaths increases after surgery when nurse-patient ratios rise. Given the facts that four patients to one nurse is the optimum, according to health sources, and that 12 patients to one nurse on night duty in Irish hospitals is common, is the Taoiseach disturbed by the danger to patients that is posed by ongoing cuts-----</p>

          <p eId="para_365">We have already made arrangements for the Narrow Water Bridge to be on the agenda for the North-South Ministerial Council meeting in June, which will be hosted here. This is an issue that concerns a great number of people obviously. We want to keep that very much alive.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> As to the constitutional convention change, Government has already agreed that there should be a referendum next year on equality of marriage - gay marriage - and reference to a number of other propositions, for example, a reduction in the voting age in regard to presidential elections. There will be no referendum this year in that sense, so Government will have to make a decision as to the number of referenda that will be held arising from the recommendations of the constitutional convention. So, the political process will be to put in place a commission to make preparations for whatever number of referenda Government decides and to introduce the legislation so the questions can be asked. That process will be put in train in plenty of time, but we have to make a decision as to what number and on what issues besides the one that is already confirmed.</p>

            <p eId="para_372">I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter in the Dáil. I am a public representative since 1999, when I was first elected to Offaly County Council, and I also served on the Midlands Regional Authority. I am well aware of the kind of public consultations that would have been conducted in those authorities, such as when the county development plans, arts plans, heritage plans, tourism plans and so on were being drafted. I am also aware of the procedures put in place by the NRA for consultation when new motorways were being constructed in different parts of the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_373"> Since my election to the Dáil in 2011, I have seen a huge shift in the means by which people receive information. As a public representative, people are engaging with me much more on social media, on the Internet, via texting and so on. The time has come for Departments and State agencies to move with the times. This has come into sharp focus for me in the debate on the pylons issue and the wind energy export proposals which the Government is undertaking and on which EirGrid undertook a public consultation. The citizens of the areas involved were unhappy because they felt the consultation was not made public enough and the opportunities were not there for them to engage fully as citizens of this country on issues that are going to be of critical importance to them. Many of the people I have met in Offaly with concerns about the wind energy export proposal feel that they have not been consulted, and they refer consistently to the Aarhus Convention. Having said all of that, I know this is a reforming Government, with serious aims about how we do our business. Examples include the Oireachtas website, <i>www.merrionstreet.ie</i> and the policy on e-tenders, and these are excellent efforts to reach out to our citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_374"> My proposal is for a website which would be dedicated solely to public consultations. It could be entitled www.consultation.ie and would be a one-stop shop for members of the public to navigate in order to find out about public consultations that are relevant to them. For example, people in Offaly could click on the Offaly link and go straight to specific consultations such as county development plans and public consultation on the wind energy export proposal. People could also engage in national consultations on issues such as end of life proposals or whatever. They would have an opportunity, if they so wished, to have their say easily.</p>
            <p eId="para_375"> I appreciate that Departments have links to these consultations on their websites, but one would need to know it is there to go looking for it. It would be a tremendous opportunity for the citizens of this country to be able to have their say. There would be great opportunities for Oireachtas committees as well. I am on the environment and justice committees, and we regularly put a call out to interested groups on the various issues we are dealing with. It would be a tremendous opportunity for them to have their say as well. I hope the Minister considers this seriously, because it would be a tremendous instrument in making our democracy more user friendly and the citizens would have their say.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brian Hayes)<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_376">I thank the Deputy for the constructive suggestion she set out in this topical issue. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, and all of us in the Government are committed to enhance public consultation. She is suggesting that we bring this all together in one website, making sure that people can consult with the Government in a variety of ways but through one particular avenue. The Minister has an open view on whether or not that would succeed.</p>
            <p eId="para_377"> Public consultations are a common, and extremely important, feature of public policy development. We want to ensure that as many stakeholders as possible are able to participate in consultations to allow us to take account of the widest possible range of views from citizens and businesses across Ireland. Indeed, in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we are currently engaged in an extremely important consultation on strengthening Civil Service accountability and performance. Submissions in response to this consultation are due no later than 31 March 2014. All consultations now already have an online element, whether through e-mail or more sophisticated technology. The Oireachtas public petitions system, which allows for online submission of petitions to Parliament, is a good example of progress made in recent times.</p>
            <p eId="para_378"> The Public Service e-Government Strategy 2012-2015 includes a section on ensuring that e-Government is designed around real needs. The strategy notes that social networking and collaborative tools can help citizens and businesses to contribute and gain insights into the development and improvement of public service delivery. It also notes the requirement in the programme for Government for greater collaboration with citizens to ensure services are designed to meet their needs. The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, which co-ordinates and reports on progress in implementing the e-Government strategy, is working with Departments and offices to achieve this priority goal.</p>
            <p eId="para_379"> As part of this work, the OGCIO is considering international experience, with interesting examples of online consultations. These include Australia, based on links to agency websites where discussion or consultation papers are published, as well as the UK, where petitions are created online via a single website - the Deputy's proposal - and assigned to departments for consideration. We are looking at international best practice and will consider how we can improve the system in Ireland. However, whatever solution is found must respect the extremely valuable inputs we receive through the chosen format of the citizen or business, and these inputs must not be stifled through the introduction of rigid online facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_380"> I think the Deputy's proposal is a useful idea which is in keeping with the Government agenda on e-Government. I understand the Minister has already asked the OGCIO to include this proposal in its research and planning activities with a view to production of a pilot site over the coming months. The House and the Deputy will be informed of progress we are making on the pilot.</p>

            <p eId="para_381">I thank the Minister of State for his response. There is no question in my proposal to move entirely to an online system, but it should be a significant part of communicating with citizens, because that is one of the means through which they are communicating.</p>
            <p eId="para_382"> In a consideration of the proposal, the e-tenders website is an excellent model, and I am thinking of something along those lines. The proposal has the potential to be a real piece of reform in improving the relationship between the public and State bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_383">Public consultation is potentially one of the most effective ways to give meaning to terms such as "engaging", "listening" and "involving the public". We talk about doing these concepts; it is time we put them into practice. </p>
            <p eId="para_384"> Public consultation is a fair way for citizens to engage with Departments and State agencies. As such, it protects the political system from accusations that it serves particular groups or interests. Public representatives are servants of the citizen and the introduction of the mechanism I propose would enhance this role. I ask the Department to consider allowing citizens not only to obtain information via the website but also to lodge submissions online. </p>
            <p eId="para_385"> I thank the Minister of State for his complimentary remarks. My suggestion is made to enable the State to better engage with citizens. If we achieve this objective, it will be a job well done. </p>

            <p eId="para_386">I thank the Deputy again for her constructive proposal, which I understand she has made on several previous occasions based on personal experience. We must reinvent the way in which consultation occurs to make it easier for citizens to become aware of what is being done in public policy across government. The pilot to which I referred has been organised by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and we are confident it will be up and running by the summer. The pilot will give rise to technical issues and an issue as to how much of the information citizens place online should be made available to other citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_387"> The Deputy correctly noted the success of the e-Tenders web portal, which provides an online opportunity for small and large businesses, domestic and international, to pitch for public sector work. One of the first decisions taken by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on taking office was to seek proposals on reform across the virtual system. Many of these proposals are being followed through.</p>
            <p eId="para_388"> While we are conscious that this area presents great opportunities, we must proceed on a step-by-step basis and in a way that ensures citizens who are consulting us and submitting views and proposals are certain that their views are being taken seriously and formatted in a manner in which they have confidence. I hope the pilot will give us a better sense of how to work through these issues when it is up and running in the summer.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_217">
            <from>Deputy Michael McCarthy<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_389">The issue I raise is the position regarding the claw-back of single farm payments and the ongoing review of land parcels. Approximately 25,000 farmers face penalties ranging from €50 to more than €9,000 following the Department's review of 900,000 land parcels. This amount does not take into account the possibility that fines for some farmers will be multiplied by five if the Department moves to impose the penalties retrospectively. This is the critical issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_390"> More than 40,000 letters have been sent to farmers notifying them of irregularities. Many farmers will have penalties imposed on the basis of land which they were informed was an excellent habitat when they were in the rural environmental protection scheme. This is a source of serious concern to farmers in west Cork and many parts of west County Kerry. I discussed the issue a moment ago with Deputy Arthur Spring who noted that farmers in parts of County Kerry are experiencing similar difficulties to farmers in County Cork because the types of land in the two counties are not dissimilar. </p>
            <p eId="para_391"> I draw the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to the severity of the fines being imposed on farmers retrospectively. The fines are based on the eligibility of land for single farm payments. While it is one thing to be fined, it creates considerable difficulty when one is fined retrospectively. Many farmers were shocked to receive a letter and the retrospective nature of the penalties is causing great angst among them. </p>
            <p eId="para_392"> Most farmers understood they had passed the eligibility test for the years 2008 to 2010, inclusive, only to receive a letter in July this year stating they may have been overpaid for these years. More than 25,000 of them now face penalties of between €50 and €10,000. The Minister of State will be fully aware of the importance to the annual income of farmers of payments made under the single farm payments scheme, disadvantaged areas scheme and other direct payment schemes. The money these payments generates enables farmers to discharge debts to creameries and co-operatives. Local economies very much depend on these payments, especially those at the lower end of the scale. It is reasonable to assume that this money, once recycled in the rural and social economy, has a significant economic benefit. I have no reason to believe this does not also apply in the case of the Minister of State's constituents in parts of County Tipperary. </p>
            <p eId="para_393"> The problem I describe is particularly acute in upland areas. It should be noted that certain categories of land which are deemed eligible in one scheme are deemed ineligible when one moves to a different scheme. The red lining of land parcels which deems areas with any level of scrub and trees to be ineligible runs against the spirit of the REP scheme as it encourages farmers to eliminate such features. Contradictory approaches are being taken in two different schemes, with one encouraging farmers to be environmentally conscious and preserve these types of features, while a second effectively encourages farmers to tear them down. </p>
            <p eId="para_394"> Chief among the steps I encourage the Minister to take is to address the retrospective application of fines. This is causing serious difficulty in these straitened times. People are conscious of every euro they spend and cut their cloth to measure when doing their annual accounts. It causes considerable difficulty if they are suddenly landed with an unexpected bill. Many of the individuals concerned receive small payments in any event, which means money is more precious. An annual bill of €500 or €600 is a large sum for many people in the current economic climate.</p>
            <p eId="para_395"> Inspectors must take a common sense approach to the difficulties faced by farmers on marginal land. I will make a number of further points when the Minister of State has replied. </p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Tom Hayes)<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_396">I thank Deputy Michael McCarthy for raising this important issue. I welcome the opportunity to clarify this issue, which is of significant concern to many people. Deputies are fully aware of the background to this issue and the necessity for the Department to carry out a complete review of the eligibility of the land parcels declared by farmers to benefit from aid payments under the single farm payment scheme and other direct aid schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_397"> In total, in excess of €1.5 billion is paid annually to Irish farmers using European Union funds. The European Commission has an obligation to ensure member states manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the schemes and general financial provisions. Under the Common Agricultural Policy, this is done by way of a clearance of accounts procedure. This is a formal process and the Commission and member states are obliged to adhere to the requirements laid down in the legislation. In the case of Ireland, the clearance procedure currently covers five financial years, encompassing the years from 2008 to 2012, inclusive, in the scheme. In that regard, I give an assurance that every effort is being made to ensure that Ireland's case and the position of Irish farmers are strenuously defended during the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_398"> All farmers are fully aware that to draw down payment under the single farm payment scheme, it is necessary to declare an eligible hectare for each payment entitlement held. Farmers who submitted an application will have been fully aware of the need to exclude from the area claimed all ineligible features such as houses, roads, rivers and forests as well as areas of scrub, ineligible bogs, etc., when submitting the annual application. Each year, my Department forwards maps, terms and conditions and covering explanatory letters to all applicants. In all of the documentation forwarded it is made very clear to farmers that they should not claim on any ineligible land or features such as houses, buildings, farmyards, lakes, bogs or scrub, etc. Given the size of farms in Ireland, all applicants who are farming the lands they declare will be fully aware of the features on their lands.</p>
            <p eId="para_399">The land parcel identification system review process initiated by the Department consists of a review of all eligible land parcels in the LPIS database which were declared by farmers under the 2013 single payment scheme, disadvantaged areas scheme and other direct payment schemes. The review covers in excess of 132,000 applicants and the land parcels declared by them as eligible for payment under one of more of the above mentioned schemes. This review is now almost complete and details will be given to the Commission. The Department is currently examining the applications for reviews-appeals submitted by farmers. If the outcome of an appeal is successful, the applicant is informed and the relevant adjustment is made to the payment. If unsuccessful, applicants are notified of their right to submit an appeal to the independent appeals committee. Where there is doubt in relation to the area deemed ineligible, such as scrub, which is a particular factor of land in west Cork, the Department arranges for the area to be clarified by a ground verification visit to the holding. I believe that is very important. More than 1,000 of these visits have taken place to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_400"> I would like to avail of this opportunity to clarify a few matters which will be of interest and benefit farmers who find themselves in this situation. The recent decisions taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine ensure protection of payments to farmers under the new CAP regime. In terms of eligible land, a decision was made to use 2013, or 2015 if lower, for the calculation of a number of new payment entitlements under the regime. This means that the number of entitlements allocated to farmers should correspond to the number of eligible hectares on the holding. In addition, the total value of the new entitlements allocated to farmers in 2015 will be based on the total number of entitlements, rather than payments, owned by farmers in 2014. </p>

            <p eId="para_401">I thank the Minister of State for his response. On the issue of inspections, there is an element of cautiousness in this regard. Farmers have enough to do nowadays to earn a living without drawing that type of bureaucracy on themselves. A significant element of the debate on the Common Agricultural Policy and decoupling was bureaucracy and red tape. One would need a secretarial assistant to do all the work involved. Inspectors making the visits will have to display some common sense and flexibility. Also, retrospection is a critical issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_402"> One of the hallmarks of this Administration has been its ability to restore Ireland's reputation internationally, including among the European institutions, not least the Commission. We have done well in several deals, not least the promissory notes deal and renegotiation of the EU-IMF deal. We need to use the muscle we flexed in our dealings with the Commission on those significant, and often thought insurmountable, issues to negotiate with it an ineligible land amnesty. We are dutiful citizens of the European Union. We perform very well in terms of our obligations and duties. We have brought Ireland back from the economic abyss. We have done that despite many of the predictions to the contrary. We need to make our case on an environmental or tourism basis. We can use the strong connection we have with the Commission to negotiate the aforementioned.</p>

            <p eId="para_403">It should be remembered at all times that Ireland receives €1.5 billion in EU aid in respect of direct payments to farmers. Farmers have become dependent on these payments to supplement their income. I accept that, as stated by Deputy McCarthy, they rely on these payments to pay their bills, etc. No farmer should, as a result of the review, be experiencing extreme hardship. It is easy to generalise. I know from my dealings on this issue in the Department and in regard to individual cases that the Department is considerate of people's positions and their payment situations. If, having gone through the formal structures in terms of an appeal, a fine is imposed, the Department should deal with the situation in a caring manner, taking into account that people are now extremely dependent on single farm and REPS payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_404"> A new REP scheme is currently being drafted in the Department, of which we need to be mindful. As I said earlier, Ireland receives €1.5 billion in EU aid. For this reason, we must ensure that the scheme is properly administered. One of the reasons Ireland was so successful in terms of its negotiations with Europe was that Ireland was seen as one of the countries that ran its business right. Inspection is part of the process. I acknowledge that several complaints have been made to the Department about inspectors. The Minister and I are aware of the upset caused to people by inspections. However, that is not the role of the inspector. In fairness, most of them are mindful of the upset caused by their appearance at people's homes. As in the case of the bag of applies, not everyone is perfect. If there are cases of hardship, they will be taken on board.</p>
            <p eId="para_405"> I would like the message to go out that we are living in an age where transparency must be part of what all arms of government do. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is no different. We want to be helpful to people. While I hope that we will become more disciplined into the future in the manner in which we operate all of these projects and schemes, I hope we will also be mindful of people's concerns.</p>

            <p eId="para_406">I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue by way of Topical Issue debate. While the meaning of the word "topical" means "current" this matter has been, regrettably, ongoing since the 1990s and even prior to then. During the time of the boom and the so-called Celtic tiger when up to €13 billion was invested in road upgrade works throughout the country west Cork was, for some reason, left behind. I am raising this issue today to ensure focus of it on the agenda and to ensure it is addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_407"> In 2008, I was chairman of the western committee of Cork County Council and led a delegation of my colleagues at the time to the National Roads Authority offices where we sought assurances from the NRA that it would prioritise the upgrade of the N71. However, the Ireland of 2008 was very different from the Ireland of today. Unfortunately, west Cork remains in the same position with little or no investment in the N71 project. The survival of west Cork into the future is dependent on investment. While job numbers in Cork are increasing, many of the jobs being created there are located in Cork city. To ensure a vibrant future for west Cork, business must be able to grow and create jobs. To ensure this, west Cork must be accessible. Unfortunately, the rail line in the area was closed many decades ago, access by sea was closed off following the closure of part of the Cork-Swansea route and airport numbers have been stagnant or reducing over the past ten years. The only access to west Cork is via the N71. It is the only road into and out of west Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_408"> I want the Government to make the upgrade of the N71 a political priority so as to ensure the survival and future of west Cork. I expect that the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, will in his response cite section 19 of the Roads Act and the changes thereto which transferred to the NRA the function of decision making in regard to road upgrade works.</p>
            <p eId="para_409">Will the Minister of State clarify what role we have as elected representatives when it comes to ensuring what constitutes a priority for the National Roads Authority? I am aware of the standard answers I have been getting from the Minister heretofore in respect of what input we can have, but I am keen for some further clarity. As elected Members we decide what taxes are to be collected. Then we go out and stand over the unpopular decisions like property taxes and so on. I am keen for more accountability from the State agencies which are spending this money. We should have more of an input into the priorities afforded by these moneys.</p>
            <p eId="para_410"> Will the Minister of State clarify why, over the 2000 to 2009 period, the NRA spent €13 billion? This was the subject of a Private Members' motion in November 2009 moved by Deputy Fergus O'Dowd calling for more accountability from the NRA. During this period of vast investment, why was west Cork not on the radar of the authority? The last serious investment in west Cork began in 1998 when 1.1 km of single carriageway was built around the town of Skibbereen. Since then there has been absolutely zero investment other than for maintenance on the N71, but no effort whatsoever has been made to upgrade it. I call on the Minister of State to get clarity on why there was no investment in the N71 during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_411"> Will the Minister of State give me an understanding and an undertaking that, at the least, the upgrade of the N71 in west Cork will be a political priority? Regrettably, previous Administrations chose, for whatever reason, not to have the upgrade of the N71 as a political priority. I could take great comfort if the Minister of State would give an assurance that it will become a political priority for this Administration.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Alan Kelly)<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_412">I thank Deputy Daly for raising this Topical Issue matter, which I will be answering on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar. The Government's policy in respect of the funding of capital projects to 2016, including the development of road links, is set out in the Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework document. Due to the overall reduction in funding for transport infrastructure, the priority until 2016 is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards. I imagine everyone appreciates that this should be a priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_413"> The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, has overall responsibility for policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme. As the Deputy has correctly pointed out, the planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the NRA under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Furthermore, within the NRA capital budget the assessment and prioritisation of individual national roads projects such as the N71 is a matter for the NRA in the first instance in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_414"> Given the heavily reduced budgets in transport, the priority now for Exchequer funds must be maintenance of the existing network, and this is of itself a struggle. Other than several public private partnership projects which are being progressed under the Government's July 2012 stimulus package, no major Exchequer-funded projects are scheduled to go to construction in the coming years. The NRA has a budget of €155.9 million for improvement and maintenance works on the national roads network in 2014. The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work required, and this is regrettable. For this reason it is not possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects. Overall, the NRA has allocated in excess of €12 million to Cork County Council in 2014 for various national road projects and works. These projects include €15,000 under the minor works programme for a pedestrian crossing on the N71 in Bandon and €450,000 for pavement and minor works on the N71 from the abbey to the square in Bantry. While this is the case for now, funding constraints mean that the development of routes such as the N71 has had to be deferred, although the improvement of national routes remains a longer-term objective of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_415"> As regards future funding under the next capital programme, the aim will be to develop a balanced package of measures covering infrastructure maintenance, safety schemes and targeted development projects throughout the transport sector for inclusion in the next capital programme. Of course the actual composition of such a package will depend on the level of funding available. Deputy Daly has asked several questions in this regard and I will bring all those questions to the Department and the NRA.</p>
            <p eId="para_416"> I know the N71 well, as the Deputy is aware, and I have had to traverse it many times. I take on board the Deputy's points in respect of Cork, funding by the NRA throughout the previous decade and the level of funding that went to Cork <i>vis-à-vis</i> other place by comparison. They are fair points and I will reflect them to the Department and the NRA. If Deputy Daly does not get an answer from the NRA within a couple of weeks, he should come back to me because I will be putting the question to them on Deputy Daly's behalf, as requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_417"> Deputy Daly suggested the matter should be a political priority but it is a matter for the Minister, Deputy Varadkar. However, I will ensure the Minister gets to know Deputy Daly's concerns on the issue. Responsibility for this issue lies with the NRA and the prioritising of projects lies with the NRA as well. Having said that, the NRA is responsible to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and has to take on board the Department's and the Minister's thinking. Therefore, I encourage Deputy Daly to continue his campaign for the N71. It is not the first time he has raised the matter. I congratulate Deputy Daly on continually raising it because it is a road that needs work.</p>

            <p eId="para_418">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and taking the issue. He has shown a good and clear understanding of the issue. I appreciate that he knows the road and that he understands the frustrations of those of us in the area. It is a single carriageway route into the heart of west Cork. We are reliant on visitors and tourists. We are also reliant on investment, like every other area.</p>
            <p eId="para_419"> It is frustrating when I tell the people that in the times of plenty there was no development of the road and no progress made. The year 1998 was the last time there was progress when 1.1 km of carriageway was upgraded, but since then there has been absolutely no investment. It is not right or proper that I, as a public representative with a mandate from the people, should go back to the people I have the honour of representing and put it to them that, unfortunately, it is the NRA which decides where the money goes and that it is at the mercy of the authority whether the people of west Cork get a decent road. I am their public representative and, as I said in my original contribution, I am the person who has gone out and supported all the measures, many of them unpopular, to raise and increase taxes to get our finances right. I appreciate that our finances are still in a perilous state and that although we are out of the grasp of the troika, we still do not have autonomy over what we can do. However, as we start to move to the area where capital budgets will improve and increase, I am keen to get an assurance from the Department, the Minister and the NRA that the N71 will become a priority and that the wrongs of the past two decades under successive Governments can be righted. I am keen for the people of west Cork to be given an assurance that as moneys come to play and to hand, the N71 will be a priority for an upgrade to ensure the survival of west Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_420"> There are competing needs on the road. Cyclists lead the charge some days and are followed by cars, buses or lorries. There can be tractors as well and all these vehicles on the single carriageway can hold up the entire area. It is most frustrating and it is time we ensured there were improvements. I appreciate that the Minister of State will take on board my concerns. I will continue to liaise with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, as well. I appreciate the Minister of State taking the matter to the Department and the NRA on my behalf and I will be grateful for any answers I get.</p>

            <p eId="para_421">The Deputy has raised this issue on several occasions and he has been right to do so. I know the road well. I am familiar with some parts of the Deputy's constituency. As Deputy Daly knows only too well, I often visit Gorteen in Bantry. The NRA has responsibility. However, I take on board the Deputy's well-made point on the prioritisation of projects and the role of the NRA <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department. Deputy Daly's point is absolutely right in respect of the changes that have had to be made from a taxation point of view. Taxpayers get frustrated, something I know only too well in respect of Tipperary. I will raise the issue with the NRA. However, in the short term, as Deputy Daly is aware, there will be no solution. However, there will be a capital programme in the years to come. Who knows what the position of road projects will be and, if there are to be roads projects, how they will be prioritised. I will refer all these matters to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, who has responsibility for the roads programme.</p>

          <heading>Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan Implementation<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T13:20:00+00:00"/></heading>
          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_225">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_422">I thank the Acting Chairman and the Minister for giving me the opportunity to speak on the offshore renewable energy development plan. The Minister will be aware that there is profound concern from all residents around Dublin Bay at the proposed Dublin Array.</p>
            <p eId="para_423">Unfortunately, many people who are interested in this area such as the Coastal Concern Alliance, believe the plan is an attempt at retrospective planning. It is an attempt to shut the stable door when the horse has bolted. By the end of 2006, some 1620 MW of wind generation had been approved off County Wicklow by the former Ministers, Frank Fahey and Noel Dempsey. In 2008, the former Minister, Eamon Ryan, came forward with significant price supports for wind. There was a huge rush of applications and astonishingly 99 leases for the Arklow and Codling Bank wind turbine fields were sold on by Airtricity, Treasury Holdings and Fred Olsen.</p>
            <p eId="para_424"> I have carefully gone through this document and while it is welcome, it is also disappointing. Why did the Minister not consider it prudent to consult the public again about some of the aspirations and comments in this document about wind energy generally, as well as the location of wind farms in Dublin Bay and elsewhere offshore? It is a grossly deficient document in that there is no cost-benefit analysis of wind or other alternative renewable energy sources. Therefore the economics of wind energy are discussed practically nowhere in this document which, in many respects, is deficient. </p>
            <p eId="para_425"> I am seeking a full Dáil debate on the document and on this project. It is deplorable that two Departments are dealing with this matter. Planning aspects are being handled by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, while energy aspects are being dealt with by Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. With two chefs, however, one often ends up getting a dog's dinner. That is what is happening in this regard. </p>
            <p eId="para_426"> I have strongly opposed the Dublin Array proposal due to the imposition of 145 turbines, some of which would be up to 160 m high, just five to ten kilometres off the south Dublin Bay coastline. It would be a grotesque intrusion on the environmental landscape. I have not seen anything in the proposed legislation about impacts on the landscape. In my own lengthy submission on the Dublin Array proposal I made the case that Dublin's quality of life and tourism would be greatly diminished if we end up looking out at a major industrial landscape across the bay.</p>
            <p eId="para_427"> Allied to this is the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan, OREDP, which cannot be discussed in isolation from the current legislative framework. We have been operating under the 1933 legislation for the past 80 years. When I was the Labour Party's energy spokesperson I called for legislation in this area, as the current Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, did also. Finally, after three years of this Government, we have the general scheme of the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_428"> The involvement of An Bord Pleanála and oral hearings as part of the planning process are to welcomed compared to what I feel were the disgraceful granting of consents in the past. It is still deplorable, however, that this legislation has not been passed. It is one of many things that should have been passed by this House a long time ago. </p>
            <p eId="para_429"> There is grave concern about this document and therefore we should have a full-scale Dail debate to tease it out. We could also address the kind of issues that will emerge not just on the east coast but also the west coast. We must examine the future role that wind energy can play in this country's energy sector.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_226">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_430">I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this matter. As the House will be aware, Ireland has a landmass of around 90,000 sq. km but it also has a sea area of around ten times that size with one of the best offshore renewable energy resources in the world. The development of this offshore renewable energy resource is central to overall energy policy in Ireland. It can enable the generation of carbon free renewable electricity, enhance security of supply, and deliver green growth and jobs to the economy. Its development clearly stands on its own merits.</p>
            <p eId="para_431"> Cost-effective harnessing of the potential for clean, sustainable, indigenous renewable energy resources, including those offshore, that Ireland is fortunate to have in abundance, is crucial to reducing our dependence on expensive fossil fuel imports, reducing harmful emissions and delivering jobs and growth in the green economy. That is why I have identified the completion and implementation of the Offshore Renewable Energy Plan as a key priority for my Department, in order to provide a clear and sustainable framework for the development of the offshore renewable energy sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_432"> The recent communication from the EU Commission on the 2030 Policy Framework for Climate and Energy recognises that renewable energy has a critical contribution to make in the period to 2030. The proposal forms the basis for a timely policy debate on the next critical milestone for the EU on its transition to a competitive, low-carbon European economy in 2050. The framework as a whole will require careful consideration and our central focus must be on reaching an outcome for all that is sustainable on both environmental and economic grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_433"> However, I have no doubt that the increasing role renewables will play in an integrated energy market to 2030 and beyond will present significant economic and development opportunities for Ireland's offshore wind, wave and tidal resources. These include the potential to export energy with the possibility in the future of participation in the European energy market.</p>
            <p eId="para_434"> The long-term economic promise of Ireland's wave and tidal resources will also be realised with the introduction of ocean energy into the renewables portfolio over time, resulting in the development of an indigenous ocean sector and the maximisation of the wider economic benefits to be gained from the commercialisation and deployment of these technologies. The objectives and actions set out in the OREDP are fully aligned with EU energy policy and the challenges faced by our EU partners in creating a sustainable EU internal market for energy and achieving the transition to a low carbon energy system. This is clearly demonstrated by the Communication on Blue Energy published recently by the European Commission, which identifies the Atlantic seaboard as the area of greatest resource in the EU and the potential for the sector to create 40,000 jobs by 2035.</p>
            <p eId="para_435"> It is with the goal of realising the economic potential of the offshore renewable energy sector, in a way that is environmentally sustainable and takes into account the needs of other users of the marine environment, that I have published the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan. The plan has been informed by a rigorous process including the carrying out of a strategic environmental assessment, followed by an appropriate assessment under the EU Habitats Directive. It involved my own Department, as well as other Departments, and State agencies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, in addition to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Institute and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_436"> The OREDP provides a clear and sustainable framework for the development of the offshore renewable energy sector and it is critical to now move ahead with its implementation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_437">Will the Minister ensure that this House will get an opportunity to discuss this plan? The Coastal Concern Alliance said the plan should be based on a democratically agreed marine policy which maps out a future scenario for our seas, while serving the public interest. Is that not the key point? We must serve the public interest and not have developer-led projects which enrich certain oligarchs. That will not achieve energy security and low energy costs for this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_438"> Will the Minister respond to the point I made about two Departments being involved? Does this not have the potential to be a disaster? Where the Department of Justice and Equality, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are in charge of road traffic administration and offences, the end result is deplorable and messy. It has led to all kinds of anomalies. It would therefore be better if one Department, perhaps the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, took full control of this matter, including all the planning aspects. </p>
            <p eId="para_439"> Would the Minister consider going back to the drawing board with this document and ask his officials to produce a cost-benefit analysis? For example, the UK has established an amount of wind energy from 45 wind farms that would fuel this country completely. It has been estimated in the UK that it costs between €100,000 and €1.3 million per job, but not too many jobs are required when the wind farm is up and running. Siemens and a number of Danish companies are the main beneficiaries of the capital investment. Will we get a proper cost-benefit analysis of the wind sector and the likely cost structure of other renewables?</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> The Minister announced the provision of a number of Exchequer supports in his initial press statement. While it is valuable to research the potential of wave power, a key issue in this regard would relate to how close to the coast the relevant facilities would be located. Most people are of the view that the wind facilities would not be even remotely economically viable unless they were located on the sandbanks just off the coast of County Dublin. If the latter were to happen, there would be serious degradation and damage done to the environment of Dublin. The cost benefit of all of this must be estimated, particularly in the context of our tourism industry and the fact that citizens who live in the Dublin Bay North constituency and elsewhere in the city and county are currently in a position to visit the seaside. Will the Minister address these issues and ensure that we will have a debate of three or four hours' duration on this topic in the next couple of months?</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_441">I would welcome a debate on this matter. Many colleagues in the House regard it as somewhat arcane and that should not be the approach to our marine wealth or to the possibilities offered by offshore wind, wave and tidal energy for the future. The report may have taken longer to be published than one would have liked. It is, however, inconsistent to state that publication of the report is belated, particularly when I was previously asked to put the matter out for public consultation again before publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_442"> I previously indicated that I intend to introduce an initial market support scheme from 2016 and that this will be funded from the public service obligation levy to the tune of €260 per megawatt hour and strictly limited to 30 MW for ocean wave and tidal energy that does not impose any significant material additional cost on the energy consumer. Work is ongoing in the context of estimating the cost of wind energy. In the EU communication paper that was published a couple of weeks ago, it is stated that the estimated marginal cost will range between €1 and €16. In the case of Ireland it will be €1 - the EU went out of its way to highlight this - while in the case of Germany it will be €16. I think I am correct in stating the latter but the Deputy should not hold me to it. There is further work to be done on the economics involved and Deputy Broughan is correct in stating that we should clarify the position.</p>
            <p eId="para_443"> I am not referring to the Deputy when I say this but all kinds of people say they favour decarbonising the energy system and developing renewable sources of energy. However, they do not want these sources to be the ones under discussion or those located near their homes. It is a case of them asking why we should have onshore wind energy when we can have offshore wind energy and why do we need offshore wind energy when we could be utilising biomass or solar energy. One is always a step away from committing those who claim to see the merit of exploiting renewable and indigenously occurring resources to stating that they do not want them in their backyard.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">Since news of the suspected eavesdropping of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission emerged and events since developed to include serious allegations of Garda malpractice based on the complaints of Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe, the uniform response of the Government, that is, of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the Fine Gael and Labour Ministers, has been to close ranks to protect the top management of the Garda Síochána and to denigrate, undermine and demean GSOC officials and both Garda whistleblowers, Sergeant McCabe and now retired Garda John Wilson.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">This is not just because of the apparent close professional relationship between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner. This is because the Garda is the institution that in this capitalist State, this Government and its predecessors relied upon not just to deal with day-to-day normal policing actions such as traffic management and crime investigation, but, crucially, to enforce the implementation of right-wing neoliberal economic and social policies such as savage austerity and the privatisation of public resources against the opposition of ordinary people. For example, this Government and its predecessors used the Garda in the most disgusting fashion to brutally repress an entire community in Mayo which was opposing the writ of giving to Shell Oil a fabulous natural resource, our natural gas wealth, with the endangerment of their community and environment. There has been in recent years a tendency to criminalise protest and to use the Garda Síochána in a very brutal fashion to oppose legitimate protests by ordinary citizens in this State. These and other similar actions of the Garda Síochána should also be investigated in a really independent way. </p>
          <p eId="para_449"> Sergeant Maurice McCabe has welcomed the appointment of a senior counsel to examine his dossier of evidence of malpractice and incompetence in the Garda after years of being victimised, isolated and slandered by certain senior Garda officers. It is a significant achievement for Sergeant McCabe that his detailed concerns about wrongdoing within the Garda are now accepted, after much personal suffering on his part, as needing a major investigation. However, appointing a senior barrister to look at a dossier like this is not enough; the victims of the highlighted Garda malpractice all support the claims of the whistleblowers. Should any serious investigation not involve them and other citizens who have been victims of malpractice and involve ordinary working people whose taxes pay for the Garda, rather than it being confined to the exclusive Law Library which is a bastion of the establishment? Will the Minister for Justice and Equality state categorically today that not only will the Garda whistleblowers be fully engaged with in any future investigation, but that he will guarantee that there will be no further victimisation of Sergeant McCabe or of any other ordinary member of the force who brings malpractice complaints against superiors? Is the Minister prepared to give that clear recommendation here today? Will former Garda John Wilson be enabled to engage with the investigation? John Wilson has also been subjected to shocking pressure, including from an individual who pressurised him to withdraw complaints against a senior officer on the erasing of penalty points. That individual also slandered Garda McCabe in a most disgusting fashion. This individual was a senior judge practising in the courts. Will that be investigated?</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> The Labour Party in particular stands shamed by its slavish failure to stand for a totally independent investigation into what anyone could see were blatant abuses by sections of senior Garda management. Who will forget the spectacle of the hapless Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, in the House last Thursday in defence of the indefensible as she hyperverbalised and hyperventilated herself into quite a state, pointing her trademark quivering forefinger and flapping her hands in such a frenzy that we thought she might become airborne as she desperately tried not to look over to the Labour benches to see the ghost of her Opposition past berating past Governments for much lesser political crimes. Democratic revolution, where are you?</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> Sections of the media have acted as a journalistic Praetorian guard for the Garda Commissioner and management undermining the complaints of legitimate whistleblowers. That is extremely consistent with the previous acts of Independent Newspapers which sacked journalist Gemma Doherty for having the audacity to question why the Garda Commissioner himself was forgiven penalty points. It is not just the Garda who need democratic supervision, but the billionaire-owned media also needs to be subjected to the democratic control of ordinary citizens to see if it could tell the truth and really represent the interests of ordinary people for a change.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">It should not be forgotten that the Garda Síochána has served this country well since the foundation of the State. Its unarmed status is a very important facet of its existence, of how it does its business. It is an organisation that has the trust and confidence of the general public which has been measured on numerous occasions over the years. The Garda Síochána is not a perfect organisation. It must be acknowledged that over the years it has made some very serious mistakes. The question is whether it will make mistakes in the future. Will some gardaí do wrong? The answer is probably "Yes".</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> I refer to a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by someone I have never quoted before, the journalist, Fintan O'Toole. He encapsulates quite well the point I have made:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_454">One thing that needs to be made clear here is that there's nothing really shameful in a democracy about the existence of some malpractice in the police force. There will always be malpractice in police forces. It is in their nature. They have extraordinary powers and, because they operate under pressure and danger, they have very strong internal codes of loyalty and omerta. This is a perilous combination. It will generate problems in the best-run police forces in the best-governed countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">That is an important point for us at this juncture because the police service in this country is one of the key institutions of state. It is incumbent upon us as legislators to ensure that at all times we have the best possible police service. We require the Garda Síochána to provide a policing service striving for the highest standards of integrity and professionalism in the manner in which it carries out its daily duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I want to challenge the use of the word "force" in the context of the Garda force - the members of the force, the force is behind me, my force. The word, "force" has connotations of control. For many people it can have connotations of intimidation. The word is outdated and should no longer be used. The Garda Síochána is there to serve; it is the Garda serving the State, serving the people. It is in the clearest of public interest that a high level of trust and confidence is retained in the Garda Síochána and this is reflected in studies undertaken and in opinion polls. Previous inquiries have highlighted major weaknesses and serious malpractice in the Garda Síochána. Today, Vincent Browne comes back to one of his more favoured topics when he lists the series of allegations over the years, some of which have been subject to an inquiry while others have not, but all of which point to some form of allegation of malpractice, that all is not right and that matters need to be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> There is something wrong when we have an unhealthy organisational culture and practices that have developed in many large organisations, be they the banks, the Catholic Church or more recently, as evidenced in cases of medical malpractice. We need to examine these examples from a cultural perspective and to ensure that what happened and what was tolerated in the past is no longer tolerated or regarded as acceptable practice. The former practices of protecting wrongdoing, sweeping under the carpet information that may be uncomfortable for an institution of State, are well gone. These days are finished. These matters, by and large, are being dealt with by this House which has provided leadership, particularly in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The same applies to members of the Garda Síochána. Gardaí at all levels must uphold their obligation to the law and to the truth above any loyalty to their organisation or their colleagues. There is no room for misplaced loyalty and no room for bullies putting their own survival or their career path above the service of the State and the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> It is important that we learn the lessons of recent events. We must allow the various inquiries that are under way to continue their work unimpeded by this House. One of those inquiries is the assessment of issues by Mr. Seán Guerin, who has been asked to report his findings and to make recommendations before Easter. The Taoiseach has indicated that no matter what Mr. Guerin recommends, he will publish the report immediately and we will have an opportunity to deal with the matter in this House. In addition, the Government has appointed the retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice John Cooke, to conduct an independent inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of the offices of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. That public interest investigation is expected to take up to eight weeks to complete. Again, its report will be published and acted upon in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> The functions and operation of GSOC, which arose out of the Morris tribunal, are now in need of review. We need to strengthen the commission's remit and its resources. The Minister has indicated that this job of work will be the subject of a broader undertaking by an Oireachtas committee. In the meantime, the Government has approved proposals, which are being brought forward in tandem with the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 introduced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to allow gardaí to make complaints directly to GSOC. Pending the early enactment of that legislation, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has confirmed the appointment of an interim confidential recipient.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> As part of its hearings into these matters, the justice committee should examine international best practice. Recent comments by the former Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O'Loan, who has direct experience of changing the culture of a police service, are instructive in this regard. Ms O'Loan should be invited to attend the committee hearings and I look forward to hearing her views. We have also heard apposite remarks from a former member of GSOC, Conor Brady, who also can speak not only with experience but with some expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> It has become clear that the management structure within GSOC is fundamentally weak and that must be rectified. What is most important, however, is that senior Garda management engage with whistleblowers when required and ensure effective systems are in place for handling such issues. There is a place for whistleblowers in our society, in both the public and private sectors. They must not be demonised by their colleagues or denigrated by senior management for raising concerns, especially where a failure to act on allegations could have a destabilising effect on the entire justice system. In addition, we need to examine the situation regarding our bail laws. The referendum that took place in 1996 resulted in the implementation of certain changes, but there remain fundamental difficulties to be addressed, some of which have arisen in the context of recent allegations.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> We must ensure a strong culture of respect throughout our institutions of State, including the Garda Síochána. That includes respect for colleagues, for the law, for high standards and for professionalism in the manner in which gardaí do their business. Most of all, we must ensure respect for the truth. The Garda Síochána owes a loyalty to the criminal and civil law of the State - indeed, to the entire machinery of the State. More than anything, however, gardaí owe a loyalty to the people of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> This is an important debate. We must allow the various inquiries to take their course and must, thereafter, act on the recommendations that are brought forward. There is no person in this House better placed to undertake a leadership role in that regard than the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niall Collins<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_465">Listening to the Minister's statement in the Dáil this morning and following events as we have been in recent weeks, we would all agree that nobody in this House - no party and no individual - has a monopoly on pledging support to An Garda Síochána or wanting to see the force do the right thing. That is to what everybody in the House aspires. Unfortunately, part of the commentary has been about who can articulate the most support for the Garda. No more than the media, politicians and every other profession in the modern world, gardaí are and must be subject to scrutiny and oversight. Irrespective of whether individuals like it, that is the way it is and we in this House must support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> What I have found most disturbing about events in recent days, weeks and months is the entire approach to the whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe. When members of the public who have been following the debate ask themselves whether they believe the Minister's version of events or Garda McCabe's version, their answer is not coming down in favour of the former. That is where the problem lies. We have had a whole series of events, briefings to the media, documents released and so on. At the back of it all, however, we have a serving garda sergeant who has been completely discredited in this House. That is most regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> It is not good enough for the Minister to deliver a statement in the House this morning, 5,600 words in length, but not find it within himself to express regret or issue an apology to Sergeant McCabe. There has been too much confusion, spin and misinterpretation and too many red herrings. The fact is Sergeant McCabe was not interviewed by the O'Mahoney inquiry. To say he did not co-operate completely undermines his credibility and character. How many people have lined up in recent weeks to testify to Sergeant McCabe's bona fides? Members of the Committee of Public Accounts, including Deputy Charles Flanagan, from right across the political spectrum, sat with me in a television studio and discussed this. People who have engaged with Garda McCabe say he stands up to rigour and scrutiny. Yet the Minister for Justice and Equality chose to come in here and discredit him. That is very regrettable and he must find it within himself to correct the record in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> What message does his attitude send out to other potential whistleblowers? Yes, we have legislation going through the House. However, if the Minister of the day in the particular Department in the civil or public service in which an individual intends to blow the whistle is seen to act like the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has acted in this matter, then we have a problem in that the legislation simply will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> Neither the Minister nor the Taoiseach dealt properly with the questions that were raised about why Oliver Connolly was relieved of his functions as confidential recipient. In effect, the Minister said in his statement that he had to sack Oliver Connolly because he did not deny or disown the truth of what he said to Sergeant Maurice McCabe. The fundamental aspect of the matter is that the confidential recipient has been dropped because, as the Minister said in his statement, he did not repudiate or deny what he said to Sergeant Maurice McCabe. The lever was pulled and the trapdoor underneath him was released. The attitude of "shoot the messenger at all costs" is corrosive to the administration of justice. The Minister previously used a private and confidential briefing to seek to discredit a Deputy in this House. A huge political problem has manifested itself around the Minister, who is in a sensitive position as Minister for Justice and Equality. He cannot think there is no problem doing what he did to Deputy Mick Wallace or Sergeant Maurice McCabe. If he thinks he can keep going, on the basis that this will pass and move on, that would be hugely corrosive.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> We are looking for an independent commission of investigation. It is worth reminding the House of what the Minister said prior to the establishment of the Morris tribunal:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_471">I am making no judgment on the truthfulness or falsity of any of the allegations made. I am saying, however, that these allegations cast a shadow over the integrity of the Garda force and it is in the vital interests of the State and the Garda Síochána that all of the allegations made be investigated by an independent tribunal and the true position made known.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">He went on in the same vein by suggesting that an independent tribunal of inquiry was needed. He continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_473">This is not a banana republic. It is a parliamentary democracy which is dependent for the policing of this State on the Garda Síochána from whom we expect the highest standards of integrity and adherence to the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">That is true. The Minister said that while calling for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry. It should not take an external barrister to tell the Government what is the right thing to do. The right thing to do is to establish a commission of investigation under the 2004 Act. It is the most fit-for-purpose vehicle available to all. It would stop the narrative which is going on across the country. People are concerned that the Garda is at the centre of a political discourse and a media narrative to the effect that something is wrong. We must face up to the fact that there are things may have been wrong. The only way to do that is to have an independent commission of investigation under the 2004 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> The Minister did not come in here today in a spirit of humility or public service to tell us he did something wrong and to correct the record in regard to Sergeant Maurice McCabe. He came in here to continue to stonewall the call that has been made by me, my party and other Deputies. He did not try to put the record straight. I ask him to make a final effort to look within himself to see whether he can do the right thing by Sergeant Maurice McCabe. Does the Minister have it within himself to correct the record and to say to Sergeant Maurice McCabe that he got it wrong? People get things wrong all the time. The Minister should come in, put up his hand and say "I got it wrong". If he cannot come in here and tell Sergeant Maurice McCabe and the rest of us that he got it wrong in the case of Sergeant Maurice McCabe, the Government's problem, which is crystallised around the Minister, is not going to go away. I will conclude by putting to the Minister a question that I intend to put to him again on Question Time. Does he have it within himself to apologise and correct the record of the Dáil? Can he reach inside himself to say that he completely discredited this man and that he is taking this opportunity to put the record right?</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_478">In clearing today's Dáil schedule for a debate on this issue, the Government has clearly and unambiguously expressed a shared desire to establish once and for all the foundations of the allegations which have been made. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is undoubtedly one of the most progressive justice Ministers we have had. The catalogue of reforms he has introduced and guided through the Oireachtas is unequalled among his predecessors. It is important to consider the legislative reforms the Minister has championed. He has maintained a Garda Síochána force strength of more than 13,000, which is higher than that planned by the previous Government at a time of great strain on State finances. The Minister secured the finance necessary to commence Garda recruitment, with a staggering 20,000 people expressing an interest in joining the Garda ranks, which is an important vote of confidence in the force. He is reforming the custodial system by championing legislation that gives a second chance to people who have committed relatively minor crimes. I refer to the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012, which I hope will be passed soon. The Minister is also introducing legislation that promotes the use of non-custodial options. He has introduced legislation to substantially overhaul our bankruptcy and insolvency systems. He has reformed the State's immigration and citizenship procedures, which have radically reduced waiting times for applications and for which proper ceremonies are now held. These ceremonies are befitting of the important status of Irish citizenship.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> The Minister has initiated a significant quantity of amending criminal justice legislation in various areas. I refer, for example, to the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Act 2011. The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill 2013 will establish a DNA database as an indispensable tool in the fight against crime. The Minister is working on two other very important issues which I warmly welcome and for which I look forward to campaigning, namely the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2013 and the proposal to hold a referendum on marriage equality. However, the important and motivating zeal and vigour which is displayed by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, can place him at odds with others who do not share his views and visions. It is fair to say that the Minister is a public representative of conviction, cast in the mould of those public representatives for whom popularity is secondary to an enthusiasm to get on with the job. It would be impossible for any Minister championing reforms of such breadth, which span many different areas, to avoid upsetting or clashing with some people.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> It is regrettable that some participants in this debate in the media and elsewhere seem unable to approach this serious issue with objectivity. Some people have allowed their dislike or personal opinions of the Minister to colour their judgment. I fear that for some people, establishing the facts of what happened has become secondary to political point-scoring. The Minister aptly described the direction events have taken when he said earlier that "a situation has been reached in which other allegations made by Sergeant McCabe have become caught up in partisan and divisive political debate". The allegations that have been made with regard to the Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission are very serious. Therefore, it is wholly appropriate that independent people have been asked to investigate the allegations and determine whether full-scale inquiries are required. The questions of when these allegations were first espoused are secondary to the need to investigate them and to establish the facts clearly and beyond doubt. Only when this has been achieved will we be able to say that public confidence in these vitally important institutions has been restored.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> An important Bill that is going through the Oireachtas, the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, will give whistleblowers in every walk of life certain rights, including the ability to provide information that is of interest from the perspective of public safety. I welcome the decision the Government made yesterday to introduce legislation in tandem with the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 to allow the Garda to make complaints directly to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. That is important in the context of a case I have come across which does not relate to the Garda. I have spoken previously in this House about an individual who was fired from his job, along with a number of other people, for questioning procedures within a health facility. It is very stressful for a person to have such information. I can fully understand the concerns of the person in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I also welcome the appointment of the retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Cooke, to investigate the GSOC bugging and the appointment of Mr. Seán Guerin SC to assess the issues and allegations made by Sergeant McCabe. I also welcome the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in investigating amending the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to expand the role for GSOC.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> The public's trust in the force is of paramount importance. Everything being done by Mr. Justice Cooke, Mr. Guerin SC and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality needs to ensure we have full confidence in An Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelCoonan" eId="spk_238">
          <from>Deputy Noel Coonan<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_484">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to put on the record my absolute confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality. He has been the most reforming and active Minister for Justice and Equality we have had for a long time. I come from Templemore, where we regularly meet members of An Garda Síochána of all ranks. I have had numerous discussions with them and the general public. They fully support the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> Deputy Niall Collins spoke about his loyalty and all our loyalty to the Garda Síochána. He complimented it and said we all had a role to play in that regard. I remind the Deputy that not only is that the case, but the Opposition has a duty of care to all members of the Garda Síochána and not just to a select few. The same applies to all members of the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> I am amazed at the amount of time the Opposition has dedicated to castigating the Garda Síochána, bearing in mind that it has more than 13,000 members. It has devoted so much time and attention to a former member and a serving member. I believe the Opposition is really playing politics with An Garda Síochána. Opposition Members might say that I would say that. However, I can give three examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The tradition of Fianna Fáil has always been to berate a Fine Gael Minister for Justice. It did so with Mrs. Nora Owen in terms of zero tolerance. It tried to hound her out of office. It is now hoping that history will repeat itself by making a prolonged attack on the Minister for Justice and Equality, something he is well able to deal with comprehensively and competently. In doing that it does not care about the damage it is doing to the Garda Síochána. I have spoken to members of the Garda Síochána and the general public, who all feel the distraction is doing untold damage to the force and needs to stop. This afternoon, I plead with the Opposition to bring this to an end and to give its support to improving the Garda Síochána and restoring its members' confidence as the Minister has done since he took office.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> Prior to the Minister coming into power, we had no Garda recruitment in Templemore; the previous Government had ended recruitment. The Minister has introduced fresh blood and recruitment is recommencing in the Garda College in Templemore, which is very welcome. The Garda did not have adequate resources - for example, there was no investment in Garda patrol cars, which the Minister has corrected. He is giving the Garda Síochána the necessary backup and facilities it so richly deserves as it looks after our interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> The leader of Fianna Fáil has been at this matter non-stop in the recent weeks, berating the Minister and thereby doing untold damage to the Garda Síochána. I ask Deputy Martin or his spokesperson to say exactly when he found out about all of this, and to confirm or deny that when members of his party came to him some years ago, he dismissed what they were saying. Now he is conveniently jumping on a bandwagon set rolling by Deputy Wallace regarding the allegations that are being made. He did want to know about them when his own party members came to him. Now he wants to jump on the bandwagon.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> I will give an example of the damage that has done. During last night's "Tonight with Vincent Browne" programme, Mr. Browne made scurrilous allegations about the Garda College. I call on him to apologise forthwith to the management and teaching staff of the Garda College in Templemore. He gave out about them being locked away down there for three or four years - he could not even get his facts right. He then referred to weirdo legal students down there, which is appalling stuff. People such as him are jumping on the bandwagon and doing untold damage to the Garda Síochána, which is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I call on Opposition Members to bring this to a conclusion by binding together and giving the Garda Síochána the backing it deserves. They need to stop the ongoing political nonsense in which they are engaging.</p>

          <p eId="para_495">There is a predictable pattern to these statements. Obviously, the Opposition will express criticism and deal with our concerns and the Government Ministers and backbenchers will speak to the virtues of the Minister and so on. I will get that out of the way first. The Minister has been extremely hard working and has brought through a large amount of legislation. In the main, he is progressive and it is a pity about this entire debacle bearing in mind the programme of work he has done and wishes to do in the future. That is not the point. That is agreed. Nobody denies that the Minister is hard working or that much of the legislation he has introduced is admirable and needed to happen. That is not the point.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> The second issue relates to An Garda Síochána, which has more than 13,000 members. Deputy Charles Flanagan is right in pointing out that we have a police service and I am glad he made the distinction from a police force. We all need to start using the term "police service" in future. Our police service is unique in that it is so close to our communities. There is no one in this House who has not played football or had conversations when we have left our children to school with a member of An Garda Síochána. Many of us have served on local community committees with them. It is a very admirable service. The vast majority of the men and women of An Garda Síochána are honourable, decent and hard-working people who have done no wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> All of these controversies are a let-down to them because a garda pulling over a motorist today to give penalty points is the one taking the flak for all this. A garda investigating matters and trying to do his or her job is the person taking the flak on the front line. The people who have been failed most are the members of An Garda Síochána and some of the families caught up in these various controversies. Also impacted, sadly, is the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> The people to have failed the members of An Garda Síochána most are their senior management. That senior management has made the errors and not dealt properly with the matters coming before it. That is indisputable. I also believe the Minister has not handled these matters as he should have.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> I listened to the Minister's speech today. He is entitled to give a defence of himself as he did on a range of matters. He is also entitled to raise the previous Administration's handling of these matters. However, I was alarmed about two issues. First, he did not even deal with the issue of the sacking of the confidential recipient and the transcript of the comments made that have given rise to major questions in the public domain. The sacking of the confidential recipient was a major development and it is remarkable that the Minister found it unnecessary to touch on it in his 30-minute speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> The second area about which I was alarmed was the Minister's return to the issue of Sergeant Maurice McCabe not co-operating and his inability to deal finally with that issue. It is very clear that the assistant commissioner, John O'Mahony, did not make any effort to go to the person in question. Can we imagine if gardaí were investigating any alleged crime and they did not go to see the witness, the person who made the report? Can the Minister imagine any scenario where a member of An Garda Síochána investigating a very simple crime or allegation would not go to the person who made it? The assistant commissioner, John O'Mahony, has confirmed that he did not knock on the door of Sergeant Maurice McCabe. He did not text, ring, call, e-mail or make any attempt to go to the people who made the allegations. If, as the Garda Commissioner apparently suggested, he gave an order to Sergeant Maurice McCabe to co-operate, why was Sergeant Maurice McCabe not disciplined? When the Minister famously went out on the plinth after the publication of the O'Mahony report back in May 2013, he strongly criticised the whistleblowers that day but why did he not refer to the fact that they did not co-operate if that was the issue for him? Why did the assistant commissioner, John O'Mahony, go to the station in which Sergeant McCabe serves and interview personnel but not see fit to talk to Sergeant McCabe? It is clear and patently obvious that they did not want to talk to Sergeant McCabe.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> When An Garda Síochána was dealing with the cold case review of the Fr. Niall Molloy case, the journalist, Gemma O'Doherty, whose immense work almost definitely led to that review, was not questioned by the team doing that cold case review. We have a culture where people who have made allegations, done the work and put their concerns about important matters of public interest in the public domain, or by whatever channel is necessary, are not even interviewed. It is indefensible. It is nonsense. The Minister should have apologised today on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> I wish to ask the Minister, who is engaged in a conversation, a question. Has he had a chance to review the transcript issued by Sergeant Maurice McCabe - a statement read out by the Commissioner - around the visit by a Garda chief superintendent on behalf of the Garda Commissioner? I will ask him this question later on, as I appreciate he cannot answer it now, but I ask him to think about it and I will revisit it later. Anyone who would read that chief superintendent's transcript of a conversation would see that it was an order to Sergeant Maurice McCabe to stay silent, not to use PULSE, not to co-operate with third parties and that there was no order for him to go out and immediately co-operate with the investigation. It is incredible that the people who were dealing with the allegations, who made them and who had gone through the process were not interviewed about all that. I cannot understand how the Minister cannot see that but there we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> In terms of the three episodes that are in the public domain, one is the issue of the penalty points debacle. To recap on this briefly, two Garda whistleblowers went to the confidential recipient, felt they were apparently being stonewalled after months of inaction and then took their concerns to the Road Safety Authority, the Comptroller and Auditor General, Government Departments and to a Dáil Deputy, as is their right under the law. The Minister then settled for an internal Garda investigation. The report of the internal Garda investigation, published in May 2013 after a period of six months, is now seen to have minimised the scale of what was being reported. Months later, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report pretty much vindicates the concern about the scale of the problem. That was the core complaint from the Garda whistleblowers - the scale of what was happening, the amount of loss revenue and the other issues related to road safety. The matter found its way into the Committee of Public Accounts. The Commissioner infamously came before it and made comments that he thought the behaviour of these whistleblowers was disgusting. Then it turns into a crisis and after almost two years and after all of that, the Minister finally refers it to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, an independent arena. That was badly handled. The Minister must see that was badly handled throughout.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> The second issue is that of the confidential recipient, the sacking of Oliver Connolly. With regard to the transcript, why would he say what he said? Where did he get that from? Apparently, he is an honourable man. The Minister said so himself when he appointed him. He is a respected solicitor. His character is not in question. Why would somebody like that say what he said? That must be answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> The third issue is the alleged bugging of the offices of GSOC, how that was handled and how GSOC was put in the dock rather than given the support of the Minister's office. What the Minister demonstrated in his handling of all three issues, because of his unhealthily close relationship with the Garda Commissioner, is that his instinct was to circle the wagons and not to get to the truth of the allegations and, in some cases, to discredit those who were making the allegations or to undermine them. The Minister has handled all three issues badly in the way he has dealt with them and the way the Garda Commissioner has dealt with them. That is why the more than 13,000 members of the Garda Síochána are under pressure, and this has impacted on their morale which has been impacted on already by cutbacks and everything else they have faced in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> Why did the Minister not avail of the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004? There is probably no Member of this House more expert on, <i>au fait </i>with, knowledgeable and capable of dealing with the legislation. He must know that legislation is almost custom-made for scenarios like we are facing now, that it would have been the legislation to use to compel witnesses, compel the production of relevant documentation and make findings of fact. Why is it that we have instead gone for a review in regard to the bugging of the offices of GSOC and another review by Sean Guerin SC? I will give these questions to the Minister. Why did he not use that legislation rather than take the option of a review in these cases?</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> There is a lot of thinking for the Minister to do. I hope these episodes will be learned from and that more powers will be given to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. There needs to be, and we have engaged in discussion on this, an independent policing authority in this State, similar to the arrangement in the north of Ireland, that is accountable to the Oireachtas, accountable to an independent policing authority representative and accountable to joint policing committees. That is where we need to get to. We need to see serious change to learn lessons from all that has happened and then the Minister can get on with the other work, on which I have commended him.</p>

          <p eId="para_509">There is much troubling talk currently about policing. It is evolving in the public mind and is gaining momentum. It refers to the fact that some gardaí are involved in wrongdoing where proper procedures are being ignored, where established processes are delayed - this is what is being alleged - where established practices are being set aside and also that a small number of officers are complicit in crime and wrongdoing. This talk is gaining currency, regardless of whether it has a basis in fact. Another category of talk is that officers wishing to follow the correct course are being prevented or discouraged from doing so. Then there is the very disturbing matter of the whistleblowers being threatened, their promotion postponed, their career advance stymied, and so on. All this concern and talk is surging to the surface now. If it spreads and takes a firmer grip on the public mind, it can become deeply damaging. It can erode confidence and chip way at the credibility of the Garda force. It could even create a crisis of credibility in State security and personal safety. Such a situation, were it to evolve, would take a generation to heal.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">It has fallen to this Government, as in so many other spheres of public and political life just now, to step in and tackle the big issues, to deal with the current policing concerns, to bring in reforms and to restore confidence. In this regard, the Government has acted decisively and promptly.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">It has held special Dáil debates. The Minister was before the relevant committee for four hours. The Government established two inquiries led by competent, qualified, highly regarded specialists in their field.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> As to the purpose of all this, it is to separate fact from fiction, to distinguish truth from hearsay. However, the Government review must go further. The Government must bring in legislation to establish a policing board. This is the only guarantee of a truly independent oversight mechanism and true transparency. I have written to the Minister in this regard. It is the only mechanism that will really underpin confidence and assuage public fears. Whether in regard to State security or personal freedom and safety, such an initiative will serve the public as well as the vast majority of gardaí, those men and women who put themselves in harm's way on our behalf, who face down gunmen, who walk lonely streets at night. It will also be in their best interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> Regarding a policing board, the Northern Ireland Policing Board, to quote Nuala O'Loan, is an effective, efficient, impartial, representative watchdog, offering accountability regarding the police service. We must learn from Northern Ireland. If we consider the issue of policing during the Troubles, we can see how the board has resolved the issue and been able to rebuild very quickly and establish confidence in all of the communities of Northern Ireland. I call on the Minister to bring forward legislation for a policing board as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_516">I have long held the view that in a civilised and democratic society whistleblowers are a positive thing. Irrespective of what career path to which it applies, be it policing, the Army or even politics, in any civilised society, both in the public interest and as legislators, we should protect whistleblowers. We do not always need to make a judgment that everything they claim is correct but it is for people like ourselves to be objective about these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> In regard to the most recent history of inquiries, tribunals and so on, I sometimes think the political establishment has learned very little from the past. I am particularly referring to the Morris tribunal in Donegal, an extensive tribunal of inquiry held over a period of six years at a great cost to the taxpayer of some €60 million. While some positive things came out of it, if anything should have been learned from the Morris tribunal, it is the point to which Deputy Conaghan has just alluded, namely, there has to be some sort of authority, as in our neighbouring jurisdiction, whether that is Northern Ireland or across the water. Policing should be independent. An opportunity was missed by the Government of the time when the Morris tribunal findings were presented. While there was talk about it, nothing happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> We are now at a place where we have been trying to wrestle with this issue for some time. Given the nature of Irish politics, the Opposition has a particular role to play. This leads to the obsession with trying to wound the Minister, the temptation of which is so great that the Opposition becomes obsessed with that and loses the very important point that whistleblowing is a public interest issue. No one should be above the law, be it a politician or a policeman. We have to confront those kinds of issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> In my three short years here I have become aware of a danger we could run out of retired judges if we look for any more inquiries. Almost every second week now there is a call for a public inquiry into this or that. I do not know what we have been up to as a society since the British left but some of it is not good. We are going to run out of judges, and I am sure some of them are taking flight at this stage in case they are called upon. I am sure there are many upstanding people in the legal profession. However, while I am not saying all of these inquiries and tribunals should not take place, because they should in certain instances, I am long of the opinion that, in many cases, the benefactors are the legal profession, not the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> I have avoided speaking up for the Minister because he does not need me to speak up for him. He is well able to do that himself and he has made his stand. Again, to repeat, we missed the opportunity after the Morris tribunal. While I am not an expert on this and there are few experts, it is the case that we in this House will have to face up to some form of policing forum or authority. That is the way to take all of these issues out of the realms of politics and make them accountable to the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_522">The Minister's contribution to the House today has done nothing to answer any of the very serious questions that have arisen in regard to how he and the Government have dealt with the allegations that have been presented to them. He again attempted to deflect, confuse and divert attention from the major issues in these various crisis that have come up in regard to how the Garda and the Department of Justice and Equality have dealt with very serious allegations.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> To try and blame Fianna Fáil for the problems from their time in government was pathetic. We all know that some of these allegations have been around for a while. The Minister and his colleagues have trumpeted that they are different, that a democratic revolution took place and that all would change. Fine Gael would bring a new politics, they said. We see that nothing has changed and, in fact, they are worse than Fianna Fáil because at least they never claimed to be anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Everyone will view the Minister's comment this morning that "whistleblowers should be treated with respect" with the contempt that it deserves. It is said that actions speak louder than words. The Minister's actions have screamed from the rooftops that he holds nothing but contempt for whistleblowers and anyone who dares to question him or his actions, or raise genuine concerns about how this system has operated. The Minister again today repeated his allegation that Sergeant McCabe refused to co-operate with the inquiry into the penalty points scandal. Not only could the Minister not bring himself to acknowledge or even apologise for the fact he may have been wrong, he has repeated it again. He is defending the indefensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> There has to be an independent inquiry into the handling of all of these issues. There also has to be an independent inquiry into the surveillance of GSOC, and it is interesting that this issue seems to have disappeared in the last week or so. That is the only way that confidence can be restored. Everyone would welcome the accountability it would bring, everyone, that is, except the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> The only people who told the truth in this whole affair are the only ones to have suffered. Garda whistleblower John Wilson was forced to retire, Sergeant McCabe has been made a pariah within the force and the confidential recipient Oliver Connolly was sacked because he would not deny the conversation he had with Sergeant McCabe.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">How can any of us have faith that the Minister will shepherd through the changes that are required to the Garda Síochána Act 2005? He is not the person or Minister to make the necessary changes. He should resign and let someone who is not blind to the problem do the job that the Irish people and the gardaí need to be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak in this urgent debate regarding allegations relating to An Garda Síochána, the role of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the GSOC issue. The Minister still does not get it. Sergeant McCabe's name was dragged through the mud; John Wilson, another whistleblower, was forced to leave his job; Deputy Clare Daly was handcuffed and arrested and the entire issue leaked to the national media; Deputy Wallace was spied on and his details leaked on "Prime Time"; Oliver Connolly was dismissed; and the well-known journalist Gemma O'Doherty played a huge price for challenging the quashing of the Commissioner's penalty points. These are huge issues and there are many more out there that should and will be dealt with and will come out in the future. Does he now get it? Does he accept responsibility as part of his brief as Minister for Justice?</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Another significant issue is the case of Fr. Niall Molloy. Ten National Bureau of Criminal Investigation detectives were assigned to investigate the murder of Fr. Molloy. Most of the evidence was based on the great work and research done by Gemma O'Doherty yet she was not even interviewed once even though her investigation led to the re-opening of the cold case. I have also raised this issue many times in the Dáil. Does the Minister get that? Does he understand the significance of it? Does he grasp the reality that many people are losing trust and confidence in the leadership and management of the gardaí? That leadership starts with the Minister. When it comes down to it, I ask myself who do I believe. Who do I trust? I know clearly that I trust John Wilson and Sergeant Maurice McCabe because I want a Garda service that serves the people in a fair and impartial manner. I honestly hope that after all this mess and after the entire truth comes out, we will have a Garda Síochána that serves all citizens fairly and professionally. In the meantime, I want an independent commission of inquiry as I believe it is the only way to get to the truth and to get justice for all the victims of these particular incidents. We need to see that public confidence is maintained in the Garda Síochána. </p>
          <p eId="para_530"> I urge the Minister to apologise to the whistleblowers Sergeant McCabe and John Wilson, face up to the terrible mistakes, have a little humility and let us all get on the with job of reforming and changing the Garda Síochána in a way that has the trust and confidence of the Irish people.</p>

          <p eId="para_531">The Minister said all along that he wanted to restore and maintain public confidence in the policing and justice system in this country. Surely it is obvious that his handling of these matters over the past two years, particularly in the past few weeks, has done the exact opposite. It has battered the credibility of the gardaí, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister. He has impugned the reputation of Maurice McCabe, somebody brave enough to speak out about what he believed to be widespread wrongdoing, malpractice and failure to investigate serious crimes. He tried to undermine the credibility of GSOC which suspected it was being bugged by the gardaí. He has sacked somebody who was involved in a conversation with the whistleblower Maurice McCabe because he refused to retract what he said in that conversation. Despite recounting his own history of wanting to bring about reform before he got into Government and of having a history of reform, he has gone native. He has closed ranks with the gardaí and tried to undermine, demonise and vilify anybody who has questioned his view of these things or who has brought serious questions about malpractice in the gardaí into the public domain, including Deputies in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Another example of this is the very serious case of Cynthia Owen. She alleges that as a ten year old child, she was raped and made pregnant by members of her own family and that senior gardaí were involved in that. The investigation of that case was a travesty. It was closed down after six weeks. Some of the people at the centre of the allegations were involved in the investigation. There was a review of the paperwork similar to the one the Minister is now proposing in these cases but Cynthia Owen was never interviewed about this horrendous case. The child that issued from that rape and abuse was murdered and serious allegations were made. Cynthia Owen's legal representatives have asked the Minister to open that case up as a public inquiry and have asked to meet him - just to meet him. I have asked two parliamentary questions about the mishandling of that most serious of cases involving rape and murder with a ten year old child at the centre of it and the Minister has refused even to meet the legal representatives of Cynthia Owen. Why? It is because it raises questions about the gardaí.</p>

          <p eId="para_536">I would like to try to take the politics out of this and look at it in a very cold, clinical and forensic light. If one looks at it that way, the accumulation of evidence here is that there is an utter crisis in the justice system in this country. There is a complete lack of confidence among the people. It was indicative of what is happening that members of the Labour Party have so eloquently expressed that view and they are welcome to do so. Justice here is toxic. Justice is regarded by the ordinary people in this country as toxic and they have lost confidence in the gardaí at the top and the management of the gardaí at the top as a result of this accumulation of evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> The fundamental problem that the Labour Party has so belatedly come to conclude today as far as I can see is that the gardaí are politically appointed. I do not know whether Members of this House were here last Friday but if they were-----</p>

          <p eId="para_540">The top 200 gardaí are politically appointed. That is a fundamental problem and is one of the reasons we are in the mess we are in at the moment because promotions, extensions and appointments are controlled by the Government. What does that mean? It means that those below the rank of Commissioner must behave in a way that pleases their political masters. That is a great pity and has had disastrous consequences. One of the beneficiaries but also one of the victims is the Commissioner himself because his promotion was due to a political appointment and any Commissioner who is appointed and then promoted is, of course, beholden to the Government who has given them that promotion or appointment. The extension of that term was a mistake. The Commissioner's treatment of whistleblowers echoes the Government's treatment of whistleblowers. To call whistleblowers "disgusting" is something everybody in this House recognises as unacceptable and something for which he should come to the Committee of Public Accounts to withdraw. The short-term solution is not just for an independent authority to be set up. If a message is to go out today from us to the people, it should be that the Commissioner should fall on his sword and resign because of his behaviour and because of his deep politicisation of this particular controversy. His treatment of the whistleblowers is absolutely and totally unacceptable. In respect of his statement that he gave a direction to them, nobody interprets that except those with a vested interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_542">I want to address briefly the contributions made by the last few speakers who spoke about politicisation and corruption in the Department of Justice and Equality and the gardaí. They have been throwing around these remarks for some weeks to give credibility to their case.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The debate of recent weeks has done nothing to enhance the procedures and legislation in place as regards the ombudsman's office. It has only politicised the administration of justice. Just a few days ago, the same group of people wished to set up a judicial appointments commission comprising their own people, yet allegedly above politics. I presume that one of the Members opposite who was vocal or an associated Member intended to chair that commission, which would have been apolitical and met their requirements. Nothing could have been further from the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> This debate originally took place in 2004 when the people on the Opposition side of the House were in government. Although I do not have the time to do so, it would be interesting to read the speech of the Minister of the day when he was setting up the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. The debate focused on whether a single ombudsman or a commission would be appropriate. The latter was chosen. The next question was to whom the ombudsman would report, if anyone, and whether the Minister would have particular responsibilities. The Opposition of the time raised questions as to whether the Minister would have any responsibility. A strange thing has happened in recent weeks. If the Minister should not be involved or have a right to respond to issues, why has the Opposition been blaming him and the Department for the problems allegedly of concern to it?</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> It must be recognised that we all support the need for an open and transparent system in which complaints can be made to a particular body, whatever that may be in this or that Department, and reports can be made and allegations checked by the relevant authorities, not politicised or brought into the Houses of Parliament. Despite suggestions from the Opposition, which seems to avoid any attempt to address these issues, the responsible authorities addressed them after being brought to their attention. I am sure that the Minister is aware I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter. I hope it will be answered tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> The scarcity of Members on the Opposition side of the House is amazing. After making a political point, they scurry out of the House to make telephone calls to their respective contacts in an effort to enhance their political status. That is what this is about. This is the most disgraceful exhibition I have seen of an attempt by Members of Parliament to politicise the operation of An Garda Síochána. They pretend that they have sought to ensure there is an open and transparent body, although we do not know to whom it would be responsible. I believe it would be responsible to themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> The Oireachtas is not, never was and never should be the place to deal with complaints. A body already exists in the Garda. In recent days, people on the Opposition side of the House have suggested that the place to report is to the Oireachtas. That is not the procedure. They claim they have no confidence. They never had, not in anything. They claim that, because they do not have confidence in the system, Members of the Oireachtas must be approached. That is not the procedure. If matters are to be handled that way in future, we will not have a reliable or robust system. We will only have public pronouncements in the Houses of Parliament. Issues will be raised, after which people will run away from them without examining them adequately.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> I will mention one or two other matters. Unfortunately, the time limit does not allow us to go into any great detail. The former Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, went into great detail to rebut the Opposition's suggestions in 2004 concerning GSOC's construction. He was clear in his mind that the structures being put in place were adequate, robust, transparent and accountable. If I had time, I would read his remarks into the record. The debate, which took place on Tuesday, 2 March 2004 at 3 p.m. in the Upper House, illustrates adequately to all and sundry. The structure was provided by some of the Opposition Members who have expressed so little confidence in it. This is the reality, irrespective of whether we like it.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> There has been a certain amount of political posturing recently in the hope that those involved will benefit. In the course of that, however, great damage has been done to the integrity of the Garda which has suffered a great deal in promoting the interests of integrity, honesty, security and justice in the State. There is no sense in being selective about incidents with which to disagree. The Garda has a difficult job. I do not doubt there are people in the Garda who should not be there. Everyone would accept this. I also have no doubt the same applies to every profession, as indicated by the occurrence of crime. Some Deputies might even be able to spend their time more usefully elsewhere. However, this does not give anyone the right to undermine the integrity of a state's police force as has been done in Ireland in recent weeks in gradual drips, creating doubt in people's minds. It is a dangerous approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> Like others, I was a Deputy when details were brought to the House's attention of various gardaí being shot, executed and so on in pursuit of their duties on behalf of the State. I find it difficult to understand why this crying is taking place now when it relates to issues in respect of which people should know better. They know full well how the system works and that a complaint in any organisation must be investigated. The question in this instance is whether complaints were investigated fully and to the extent of the Opposition's satisfaction. The answer is that the Opposition does not need to be satisfied. Rather, an investigation must satisfy the conditions laid down in the original legislation. This morning and afternoon, the Minister and Taoiseach indicated clearly in the House that the procedures had been followed. What has been suggested in some Opposition quarters, that there was a cover-up, is not true.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I am amazed that taped conversations have become the basis for lodging complaints. I believed that documents marked "confidential" were not meant for disclosure to all and sundry so that people might promote their political philosophies. "Confidential" means confidential, particularly in terms of justice. It is about time that some people in this House recognised that they also have responsibilities in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">I know. One can do a lot of damage in 40 seconds depending on which way one goes. I will refer to the Dáil debate of 22 June 2005 on the establishment of the ombudsman commission. A current Minister of State, Deputy Costello, made a considerable contribution to the then Minister to the effect that most of the Opposition was unhappy with the office's structure. The Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_554">What I have put in place, and what I stand over completely, is that for the purposes of sovereign Government and accountability to this House, if a dispute arises as to whether a file in the possession of An Garda Síochána should be made accessible to the Executive power of this State, it should only be accessible if the most senior civil servant in my Department, who is not under my direction in this regard, concurs and demands the production of that file.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">It is deeply depressing that the democracy of this State and the functioning of government has been paralysed due to weeks of collective failure by the Government to uphold the free and fair administration of justice. This is not just a matter that falls on one Minister. The events of recent weeks have demonstrated the profound weaknesses that exist here in the 31st Dáil. Those watching on their television screens have observed with deep scepticism the concern that Deputy Micheál Martin has portrayed over the last few days and weeks; this is the same man who for decades defended the indefensible and sat in a Cabinet which oversaw the financial destruction of the State. Equally, the general public is expected to believe that Deputy Gerry Adams, without any hint of irony, has concern for the protection of whistleblowers; this from a man who is widely accused of ordering the abduction and murder of a woman who his movement believed to be a suspected whistleblower. Forgive me and many people outside this Chamber if we have difficulty in stomaching that level of cognitive dissonance.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> Three years ago, two thirds of the people elected by the Irish people to this House were from Fine Gael and the Labour Party; over 100 men and women elected by over 1 million voters who put their trust and faith in us to defend their interest and to protect the public interest at large. I know very well that there are members of the current Cabinet and colleagues in the Fine Gael and Labour parliamentary parties who have been privately appalled by what has taken place over the last number of weeks. I know that because they say it in private. These Members are not appalled because they believe it is damaging their support for the local and European elections; they are appalled because of the cavalier attitude shown to matters of profound importance to the free and fair administration of justice in this State. Yet for these public representatives, public silence is absolutely deafening. Politics is supposed to be about more than simply the parish pump and local issues on which Government TDs will happily challenge their own Ministers. Defending the indefensible on the grounds that the current Minister for Justice and Equality acted in the exact same fashion as his predecessor in Fianna Fáil - essentially what was argued this morning - is not what the almost 1.2 million voters who voted for Fine Gael and the Labour Party expected of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Nobody can dispute the diligence, duty or dedication of this Minister for Justice and Equality, but neither should these qualities excuse him from a failure to act, nor a refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing. The single fact remains that the Minister received a Garda confidential recipient report from Oliver Connolly in January 2012, outlining a number of grave allegations which have been well reported in recent days. Less than a week after the Taoiseach received what we believe to be the exact same documents the Minister received two years ago, independent outside counsel has been appointed to investigate these allegations and to explore the need for a full commission of inquiry. The question remains: why did the Minister chose not to adopt the same course of action two years ago, besides arguing that it was precisely what his predecessor, Dermot Ahern, did or did not do? What damage has the Minister's inaction caused in the intervening two years? These are serious questions and I hope that we will receive some answers to them this afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> I firmly believe that the vast majority of the 1.2 million people who voted for Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the last election did so because they honestly believed that they would be given something different to what went before. Whether the polls move up or down, the silence of over two thirds of the Members of this House in upholding their constitutional duty to hold the Executive to account is an extremely sad indictment of the state of democracy in this country at this point in time.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">Amid all the political mud slinging in recent days, it is important to remind ourselves that this debate is about two central but distinct issues, and the Government's handling of those issues. The first issue is the alleged bugging of GSOC and the second is the way in which official Ireland responds to Garda whistleblowing. In respect of the latter, Sergeant Maurice McCabe is certainly owed an apology. The portrayal of his whistleblowing actions and those of his colleague John Wilson as "disgusting" is completely unacceptable. It sends a clear message to others considering speaking out that if they do, they will regret it.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> The response of the Minister for Justice and Equality to this entire saga has been appalling in my view. He broadcasted allegations against Deputy Wallace based on tittle tattle, which was a disgrace. In any other country, he would be sacked for that alone. However, his most serious bad mouthing is in respect of Sergeant McCabe. He has consistently tried to peddle the untruth that Sergeant McCabe did not co-operate with the Garda inquiry into his allegations of Garda misconduct. This is despite the fact that Sergeant McCabe's good character has been attested to by many, including the former Garda Ombudsman, Conor Brady, and the former confidential recipient, Oliver Connolly.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> The other central issue - arguably even more serious - is the allegation that GSOC was bugged. Again, there was a concerted campaign by the Government to rubbish these concerns. The incredible thing is that we still do not know if it was bugged and if it was, who was bugging it. The instinctive reaction of the Taoiseach and the Minister was to undermine GSOC by peddling more untruths about its legal responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> There is no question but that we need a full independent commission of investigation into all of these matters. We now have six different types of inquiry or review under way, none of which is adequate and most of which are simply delaying tactics. The public is not interested in whether or not the Minister can pin any of this on Fianna Fáil. The public wants to know whether or not the Minister, his colleagues in Fine Gael and his sleeping partners in the Labour Party, are up to the job of governing properly. Increasingly, the jury is out on that one.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_566">I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this critical debate in the House. I also share the strong concerns of other Deputies about the nature and extent of the allegations made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe on Garda misconduct and the potential dereliction of duty. I welcome the decision of the Government to initiate the review of the dossier by Sean Guerin SC, as well as the earlier decision on the review by Mr. Justice Cooke. I think we should move to a commission of investigation under the 2004 legislation immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> I was not able to be present for the Minister's speech this morning, but I studied it very carefully. It is hard to imagine why a Minister who has been very vigorous in respect of legislation on other matters, would not have conducted a much more transparent and quick investigation of this matter in the two years since he became possessed of these very serious allegations. It could have been resolved in 2012. I have continuously been pursing him regarding the failure to apply fixed charge notice penalty points, and have highlighted in particular the campaign run by the PARC road safety group.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The serious allegations made by former Garda John Wilson and Sergeant Maurice McCabe on the specific issue of full enforcement of the road traffic laws are another reason to establish a commission of inquiry. </p>
          <p eId="para_569"> I have always been a strong supporter of community policing, as are many other Deputies, and I organised joint policing committees in my constituency before the House passed the relevant legislation. Labour Party policy for the past two decades has been to have an independent Garda authority. The current debacle has underlined the necessity to separate the Garda Síochána from Ministers and politics in respect of all operational matters. </p>
          <p eId="para_570"> I note Deputy Mick Wallace tabled a Bill some months ago to amend the law to make the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission more independent and strengthen its powers. I join other Deputies in commending Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace on their courageous initiative in this matter. I also share the views expressed by the former Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O'Loan, who noted the weaknesses of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, including its lack of powers to investigate the performance of the Garda Commissioner and access all information on the PULSE system and criticised the fact that serving gardaí are working for the commission. The best way forward would be to establish a commission of investigation. </p>

          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_571">The gravity of this matter requires all of us to take it seriously. We all have a responsibility to restore confidence in the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and an Garda Síochána. Speaking on a Private Members' motion last week, I noted that the Garda Síochána is held in high esteem and is a pivotal pillar of our democracy. Many gardaí have expressed disgust to me that their force is being discredited by many people. The Garda Síochána is the guardian of the State and its members do tremendous work. It behoves all Deputies to ensure this is at the forefront of what we do.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> I have a message for Deputy Shortall. Deputies on this side take their job in government seriously and will not funk or walk away from tough decisions. Speaking this morning, the Minister stated: "My concern is, as always, that the full truth is known". That is correct and he is a prodigious, reforming and honest Minister for whom the interests of citizens are at the heart of what he does. </p>
          <p eId="para_573"> Those who make claims about the Garda must examine their role in this matter. We must protect whistleblowers, which is the reason the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has introduced a Bill in this area. We must also place victims of crime at the heart of what we do, which is the reason the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, will bring legislation on victims rights before the House. If Deputies have a family member, colleague or friend who has been the victim of crime, they will be aware of the heartache and horror associated with crime. The Minister is taking action for this reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> Last night on "Six-one", when asked by Brian Dobson whether he was satisfied in his own mind that these concerns were not raised with the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform during the period in question, Deputy Martin stated, "I am". No one, including the whistleblower, made any such assertion and Dermot Ahern has trenchantly asserted that these concerns were not brought to his attention. I ask the Minister to reveal to the House the full facts regarding the information available to Mr. Ahern when he was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Last night's statement by the Leader of the Opposition on "Six-one" was astonishing. </p>
          <p eId="para_575"> What we have seen from Deputy Martin is a cynical act of political opportunism, a continuation of the Punch and Judy type of politics he promised to end when he spoke on the issue on 9 March 2011. He has done so to exploit the victims of crime and their families for the short-term gain of the Fianna Fáil Party, whose Members were missing from the benches opposite for more than one hour of this debate. Moreover, neither the party leader nor its spokesperson on justice is in attendance. </p>
          <p eId="para_576"> Why did Deputy Martin not give the full facts on television last night? Why did he rush to appear on "Six-one"? We need to have one Minister with responsibility for justice, one Garda Commissioner and one police or Garda service to use the words of Deputy Charles Flanagan. I hope the Minister, during the questions and answers session, will give the House full details of the correspondence received by the former Minister, Mr. Dermot Ahern whom he exonerated when he introduced the debate. The people and families named by the Deputies opposite want answers and deserve to have this information. </p>
          <p eId="para_577"> Victims of crime must be placed at the heart of the justice system. The Garda and criminal justice system must always work with victims because their lives have been affected by crimes such as murder, assault, misinformation, disappearance and so forth. If we want to see the full impact of crime, let us consider the families who have been affected by it. Deputies must act as custodians for the period for which they are elected. </p>
          <p eId="para_578"> Deputy Lucinda Creighton spoke about the previous general election. I will not run away from decisions or decline to question Ministers. The Deputy may smile at me cynically but I take my job seriously, as do many of my colleagues on the Government benches. To say otherwise is to engage in populism and Deputy Creighton is better than that. This issue is about people's lives, the Garda Síochána, victims of crime and a Minister who has been maligned for cheap political gain. We can continue to play Punch and Judy if the Deputies opposite so wish but we must also reform how we do business in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_579">At the centre of the many current controversies are a group of victims. I note the language used by some Deputies from the Technical Group, all of whom are notable by their absence. I welcome the presence of some Fianna Fáil Party Deputies as I was beginning to believe they would not return to the Chamber. It is also noteworthy also that there are no Sinn Féin Deputies present.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> If the victims at the centre of this controversy are following this debate at home, they must be wondering why the cases of their loved ones have been brought into a political squabble and an attempt to smear the Minister for Justice and Equality, which is clearly the objective of many of the Deputies opposite. This morning, when the Minister outlined a catalogue of actions he had taken, including letters he had written and correspondence with the Secretary General of the Department and others, Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches were crestfallen. The leader of the Opposition became tetchy when he delivered his script because his hopes of undermining the Minister and walking out of the Chamber with his head fell asunder.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The debate was cynically politicised just a few minutes ago when another Member known for grand-standing, Deputy Ross, walked in and called for the resignation of the Garda Commissioner before walking out again. He regurgitated the same speech he has made on multiple occasions in the past three years. I have no doubt I will read it again on the pages of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. </p>
          <p eId="para_582"> Issues relating to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission are being investigated by Mr. Justice Cooke and a senior counsel has been appointed to examine issues related to whistleblowers. This does not satisfy some Deputies because their political motivation, regrettably, is to smear the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> We hear about the need for a separation of powers and calls on the Minister not to interfere in the operations of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and Garda Síochána. This morning, however, the leader of the Technical Group, Deputy Joan Collins, lacerated the Taoiseach on the basis that the Minister was not interfering in the operations of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. Having argued that the Minister should not have any contact with the commission, the Deputy called on the Minister essentially to take over the commission and tell it what to do and how to do it in order that she and Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace would be satisfied. The Deputies want to have their cake and eat it and then take it to a stall on Grafton Street to try to sell it. They want to do everything and nothing, which is regrettable. </p>
          <p eId="para_584"> Deputy Lucinda Creighton was doing fine when she made two assertions about the leaders of the Opposition parties. She then stated, however, that two thirds of Deputies have taken a cavalier attitude to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I do not know where Deputy Creighton has been but this is the fourth or fifth occasion on which I have spoken in the House on this issue. I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, at a meeting of which I questioned the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on his actions in relation to this matter, as have my colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party. If Deputy Creighton chooses not to accept or take on board what we as Government backbenchers are doing, that is her own problem. The Deputy made clear her own position when she left Fine Gael. For her to come in here and try to smear Fine Gael backbenchers just because she might have an issue with the-----</p>

          <p eId="para_591">The ultimate issue is confidence in An Garda Síochána. If as Members of the Oireachtas we are to be true to our word we must allow Mr. Justice Cooke and the senior counsel appointed to examine these two issues the space to do so. The Taoiseach made it clear the other day that if a commission of investigation is required one will be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> I would like to put a number of questions to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, at this point because I must attend a committee meeting on this issue and I will not get an opportunity to ask him later. The Minister said in his statement to the House this morning that the matter had been brought to the attention of the then Minister for Justice. Did the then Minister bring a memo on the matter brought before Cabinet and were other members of the Cabinet aware of the matter? What action was taken in that regard and was the Department satisfied that the action taken by then Minister was adequate? It is worth pointing out that despite the cynical attempts to smear the current Minister, all of the issues we are now discussing are of a time when the Minister, Deputy Shatter, was the Opposition spokesperson on justice calling for the introduction of these powers. </p>
          <p eId="para_593"> The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has been accused of trying to ensure that GSOC and independent oversight of the Garda Síochána is limited. If members of the Opposition care to check the record relating to his time as Opposition spokesperson, they will find that the contrary is the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">I want to deal with a particular aspect of this debate, on which issue Ministers have made public comment during the past few days, namely, how the Garda Síochána fits into the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, Second Stage of which is currently before the Dáil and may conclude this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> On 4 February 2014, some three weeks ago, I contributed to the Second Stage on the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013. I spoke specifically about section 19 which deals with the amendment of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. I made a number of observations in relation to that section which will be followed up by way of amendments tabled for consideration on Committee Stage of the legislation. Section 20 of the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 deals with complaints in relation to the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004. There is a contrast between how complaints and whistleblowers are dealt by the Garda Síochána legislation versus the Defence Forces legislation. There is a need for consistency in this regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_598"> Section 19 of the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, commonly known as the whistleblowers Bill, which appears to be good until one examines it further, seeks to insert a new section requiring the Minister, following consultation with the Garda Commissioner, Garda ombudsman and the inspectorate, to make regulations providing procedures for the making of protected disclosures and seeking redress for a member of the Garda Síochána that makes such a protected disclosure. On the face of it, that appears good. However, it is not half good enough when one considers the culture of what is happening in terms of how people are being dealt with. </p>
          <p eId="para_599"> I would like to reiterate the points I made during the Second Stage debate three weeks ago. First, I support the Minister, Deputy Howlin, in his desire for proper protected disclosure within An Garda Síochána. I believe the full measure of this should be dealt with in the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 in the context of the amendments being made to the Garda Síochána Act 2005. It should not be left to the Minister for Justice and Equality to further amend that legislation in due course. </p>
          <p eId="para_600"> Second, it is typical of this Government's top-down approach to matters that in introducing a whistleblowers mechanism into An Garda Síochána, it consults the Garda Commissioner, the Garda ombudsman and the inspectorate. There is no mention of the 12,500 rank and file gardaí or the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. The Government is proposing to introduce this mechanism without any consultation with the people involved, except top brass. I said also at that time that this matter should not be addressed by way of regulation, which is a statutory instrument done in private by the Minister, but by way of primary legislation such as the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 which is currently progressing through the Houses. If it is necessary to draw up a draft of the regulations to incorporate them into the primary legislation, then that needs to be done before the aforementioned Bill is finalised. It is not acceptable in this day and age to state in legislation, as is the case in the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, that the Minister will bring in regulations in due course. That is no longer good enough. We want to see the matter dealt with in the legislation and not by way of regulation following discussions between the Minister, Garda Commissioner, Garda ombudsman and the inspectorate, a process in which rank and file gardaí, Members of the Oireachtas or the public have no opportunity to be involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> I want to put on record again that the vast majority of gardaí on the front line do an outstanding job on behalf of the public. This controversy is damaging to them. The cause of that damage is the manner in which this issue is being dealt with at senior level and how the Garda Síochána interacts with the Department of Justice and Equality. All of the problems are happening at senior level rather than ground level. Fianna Fáil is opposed to any attempt to put in place by way of the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 a procedure which applies to all public and private organisations and allows the Minister to draw up regulations for Garda whistleblowers. There should be no exemption for staff of the Minister's Department. There should also be consultation with rank and file gardaí about these measures. This matter must be addressed during Committee and Report Stages of the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, at which time Government will have an opportunity to accept Opposition amendments to incorporate in the Bill measures which the Minister said previously he would like to see in it. We will give members of the Government an opportunity to do that, thereby testing their sincerity about putting proper whistleblowers legislation in place.</p>

          <from>Deputy John McGuinness<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_602">I have listened carefully to the debate. I point out to the previous two speakers from the Government backbenches that when I spoke on this issue in the House last Thursday morning there was no member of Fine Gael in the House. That matter was raised at the time by a former member of Fine Gael. Out of respect for other Members, I responded that they were probably watching the proceedings on monitors in their offices. That is what happens. Let us not get diverted by comments like that. Let us also not be diverted by the politics swirling around this issue or by the ongoing political noise around this debate. I ask that the Minister focus on the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe. There are serious concerns about what he has had to say. I ask too that the Minister not forget - I made this appeal to the Minister, Deputy Howlin last week - the case, of which he has been aware for the past 18 months, of Lucia O'Farrell and the tragic death-murder of her son, Shane. She has been writing to the Minister in relation to the process of justice, the investigation of the case and the issues that arise from that investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Lucia O'Farrell and her husband Jim have asked that the Minister would consider that case and what happened to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> I appeal to the Minister to now address the matter because I know he has the papers - he has acknowledged them. In the past 18 months Lucia O'Farrell has received no response bar acknowledgements. She is calling on the Minister to consider the case she is making regarding the death of her son. I am appealing to the Minister today to do precisely that not only for her but for the many other cases in which people and families believe they did not get recognition, due process or justice. This is not politics, it is a Member of this Parliament appealing to the Minister for Justice and Equality to investigate. I would appreciate it if the Minister took note of that after he has finished whispering to Deputy Buttimer.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> The next matter I wish to address is the independence of the confidential recipient. The Minister referred in a statement this morning to a sexual harassment case in the Garda as if it was the only case - that is what the lady concerned has picked up - but it is not the only case. There is another case that has been processed through all of the available procedures in place but it has got nowhere. I question the fact that the Minister sacked the confidential recipient rather than keep him in place until this matter has been fully dealt with. I would like to have asked the confidential recipient why he said to the lady that the last man who used the service was now washing cars in Navan. That is what was said. The person stands over that claim. He later went on to say-----</p>

          <p eId="para_609">This is a fact. The garda then went on to ask the confidential recipient to process the complaint, questioned the fact that nothing was happening and then asked for an update on the position. I would like to ask the confidential recipient whether he said to her that it had gone too high to cover it up and that it had to be investigated. He then suggested to her not to forget his proximity to the Minister and not to think that he had not had a word in his ear. I am simply repeating to the Minister what the garda has said.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">I welcome the opportunity to speak on what is an issue of substantial national importance, one which has been in the public domain continuously for several weeks. I was pleased to hear the Government announcement yesterday that a senior counsel will make an assessment of all the issues that have been the subject of so much controversy. I believe this is the right thing to do and I am certain that if the assessment recommends a commission of inquiry, then there will be one. A commission of inquiry might be the best outcome in the long term. All of the issues need to be resolved in a way that ensures public confidence in An Garda Síochána is upheld and maintained and such that members of An Garda Síochána are able to do their job and report wrongdoing if they believe there has been wrongdoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> I have referred to the Mahon tribunal in the House previously and I wish to do so again because I believe the report makes for relevant and powerful reading when it comes to the matter we are discussing. One of the passages in the report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_621">Corruption is frequently an offence committed by wealthy and/or powerful members of the Community and those reporting it may well fear the consequences of doing so for their own careers and employment prospects. Whistleblower protection may help alleviate those fears, thus facilitating the reporting of corruption offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">In this context I wish to take this opportunity to restate my support for the protected disclosure legislation which I had the opportunity of speaking on in the House recently. That legislation will help to ensure that serving gardaí will be able to make complaints directly to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. This will be a positive step that will see a more direct and responsive approach if an issue of wrongdoing should arise. As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality I look forward to the work of the committee in reviewing the 2005 Garda Síochána Act. I believe that review should consider recommending that the powers of GSOC should be extended to include the post of the Garda Commissioner.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnneFerris" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Deputy Anne Ferris<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_623">Much has been said in recent weeks about the public interest. GSOC commenced what it termed a public interest investigation into suspicions of surveillance of its offices. Last week a retired High Court judge was appointed by the Government to consider among other matters the decision of GSOC to withhold information about its investigation from the members of the public in whose name it had been initiated. Garda whistleblowers maintain they were prompted by the public interest in releasing information about Garda activities into the public domain. An eminent senior counsel has been asked by the Taoiseach to consider the whistleblowers' information and decide whether a public inquiry should be held in the public interest. These issues have raised four matters of significant public interest which must be given priority by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> The first is the tragic murder of Silvia Roche Kelly in a hotel in Limerick. This woman's family need to know if her death was avoidable. The public need to know if Silvia Roche Kelly was a victim of errors in our policing system and, just as important, whether any errors were properly investigated and resolved. If the death of Silvia Roche Kelly happened because of Garda errors or misconduct that have not been resolved since her death, then tomorrow any one of us could be the next Silvia Roche Kelly.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> The second issue of significant public interest is the management by the Garda of the abduction and assault of the Kells taxi driver, Mary Lynch. This woman is entitled to know why her assailant was released on bail without her account of the attack being made available to the courts. The public needs to be assured that an attack of that nature will be properly investigated in future by the Garda and that the attacker will be brought to justice. Women in particular need to feel safe while going about their daily business.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The third issue of significant public interest is the attempted abduction of a five year old girl by Jerry McGrath when he burgled a house in County Tipperary while on bail. The family of this young girl, who is no doubt seriously traumatised by the event, need to know why a dangerous criminal was out on the streets and not in prison. All parents and grandparents of five year old children throughout Ireland need to be assured that their children are safe from predators who would otherwise be in prison if the justice system had managed prior offences correctly.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The fourth issue of significant public interest is the bugging of the GSOC offices. The public need a strong authority for investigating complaints about the Garda. Gardaí need a strong authority for investigating complaints about the Garda. Any suggestion that GSOC is less than secure will undermine its authority. Any evidence that GSOC has been bugged calls into question the security of other organs of the State. This matter needs to be fully investigated in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> The fifth issue of significant public interest is connected to the other four. The Garda Síochána comprises of 13,000 members. I have said on several occasions that the vast majority of the men and women in our police force are decent, honourable and upstanding members of Irish society. The vast majority of these gardaí are as appalled as everyone in the House at the mere thought that corrupt or incompetent gardaí contributed to the serious crimes I have described.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> The public needs us to preserve what is good about our Garda force, while hunting out what is bad. It is in the public interest for the events discussed over recent weeks to lead to a better police force. I welcome the appointment of Mr. Justice John Cooke and Mr. Sean Guerin SC, and I look forward to the investigations they will conduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> Just as important for the public interest in the future is the Government's decision to refer the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for review. As Vice Chairman of that committee, my aim will be to see real change emerge from that review. I would like to see a stronger GSOC and a better Garda force result from much-needed changes to the legislation governing both bodies. That would be very much in the public interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_631">Tá a lán líomhaintí, ní hamháin os comhair na Dála ach os comhair na bhfiosrúchán difriúla atá ar siúl. Measaim go bhfuil sé ceart go mbeadh muid ag déanamh cinnte de, ag deireadh na bhfiosrúchán siúd ar fad, go mbeadh muinín ag an bpobal ní hamháin as An Garda Síochána ach as an gcóras dlí agus cirt ina iomlán chomh maith. Ní hamháin gur cheist maidir leis An Garda Síochána atáimid ag plé leis ach ceisteanna maidir le GSOC, an confidential recipient agus an tAire féin chomh maith. Sin iad na ceithre colúin atá i gceist. Muna thagann arís ár muinín san Gharda Síochána agus a bhaineann leo agus sa chóras dlí agus cirt, is drochlá é don daonlathas agus don Stáit.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> Is fíor-líomhaintí tromchúiseacha atá leagtha i gcoinne ní hamháin an tAire féin agus an Garda ach i gcoinne an Taoiseach chomh maith nár déanadh obair tapaidh go leor maidir leis na líomhaintí a bhí sa dossier a chur an Sáirsint Maurice McCabe os a chomhair agus os comhair daoine difriúla thar thréimhse. Ní dhearnamar práinn mhór go leor agus níor thugamar tábhacht mór go leor do na ceisteanna móra a d'ardaigh sé. Tá siad sin fós os ár gcomhair.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> An tseachtain seo caite, chuir an tAire an t-iar-bhreitheamh Cooke i mbun fiosrúcháin maidir le GSOC, an cúléisteacht agus cad a tharla ansin. Chomh maith leis sin, tá an tAire tar éis a fhógairt go mbeidh an t-abhcóide, Sean Guerin, ag déileáil leis an gceist, ag tabhairt sracfhéachaint ar dhoiciméadaí atá ar fáil idir an tAire agus An Garda Síochána faoi cad atá i measc an phobail anois, is é sin, an méid a bhí Sáirsint Maurice McCabe ag cur trasna. Chomh maith leis sin - níl fhios agam cá bhfuil sé anois - bhí fiosrúcháin inmheánacha laistigh den Roinn Dlí agus Cirt agus Comhionannais maidir le mo líomhaintí céanna. Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil tuairisc le teacht, an bhfuil sé tagtha nó an bhfuil in ann dó in aon chor laistigh den Roinn. Ag an am céanna, tá cás san Ard-Chúirt maidir le Sylvia Roche Kelly.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> Rud eile nach bhfuil mórán daoine ag díriú isteach air agus rud a dhéanfaidh tarrtháil amach anseo ar an tslí a oibríonn An Garda Síochána ná Cigireacht an Gharda Síochána. Sa deireadh thiar thall, siadsan a fheiceann ar conas mar a oibríonn An Garda Síochána, conas mar a déileálann siad le fiosrúcháin - ní hamháin an ceann seo ach le gnáth-fiosrúcháin - conas a déileálann siad leis an bpobal agus conas a déileálann a bhaill lena chéile. Bunaíodh an cigireacht faoi stiúir Kathleen O'Toole, an póilín ó Mheiriceá, chun a dhéanamh cinnte de go mbeadh an caighdeán agus an bealach oibre is fearr ar domhain againn sa Stát seo. Go dtí seo, níl sé sin le feiceáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> Tá a lán os ár gcomhair, nílimid tagtha fiú ar tús an scéil seo agus measaim go bhfuil níos mó le teacht chun cinn. Sin an fáth, measaim, go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos éasca dúinn sa deireadh thiar thall é seo a thógáil as an gciorcal, an arena, polaitiúil agus é a chur isteach i gcoimisiún fiosrúcháin seachas é a thabhairt do abhcóide a mbeidh tuairisc aige roimh nó i ndiaidh na Cásca beagnach ag an am céanna agus a mbeidh tuairisc ón mBreitheamh Cooke. Dá mbeadh sé seo go léir curtha isteach i gcoimisiún fiosrúcháin amháin, bheadh a fhios againn ag deireadh an scéil go mbeadh tuairiscí firiciúla tagtha os ár gcomhair agus go mbeadh muid in ann obair dá réir. Má thagann ceachtar den dá fiosrúcháin atá mé tar éis a luadh chun cinn le moltaí nó le cásanna cúirte nó fiú le cásanna gur chóir go mbeadh ag dul os comhair na cúirte, ní bheidh siad in ann é sin a dhéanamh. Beidh orainn teacht ar ais anseo agus coimisiún fiosrúcháin a bhunú. Faoin am go mbeidh na fiosrúcháin a luaigh mé críochnaithe, beidh muid trí mhí taobh thiar den áit gur chóir go mbeadh muid.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> I have a problem concerning where we are at the moment. At this stage, we should have passed this and other justice related matters that have come to the fore in recent weeks to a commission of inquiry. Such is the level of public concern, including concern in this House, over the possibility of malpractice, incompetence or worse at a level within An Garda Síochána, it should have been taken out of the political arena and given to a commission that could have investigated it from start to finish.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> What has happened, however, is that a barrister will scan a number of documents, but why was that not done in the first instance? These documents have been in the possession of the Minister and others for quite a long time, but they did not receive proper, urgent analysis. This matter is so serious that a commission of inquiry is required and it should have happened from the start. We would then have been further down the road towards getting the facts by the end of this session or early in the next session.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> Neither Mr. Justice Cooke, whom the Minister has tasked with dealing with the GSOC scandal, nor Mr. Sean Guerin SC, to whom other questions have been referred, can come up with statements of fact that can be used in court or to charge somebody if they are perceived to be guilty of incompetence, malpractice or worse, as has been alleged.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> Much of the current situation results from failures during the earlier passage of the Garda Síochána Bill which has been enacted. We did not have a Minister who believed that the culture within An Garda Síochána at a certain level was such that it required the equivalent of what was introduced in the North. I remember arguing across the Chamber and in committee with the previous Minister, Michael McDowell, at that time that a more robust Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission was needed. In fact, I argued that it should be an individual, such as the Police Ombudsman in the North. I also argued for more resources and that the office should be built on the same scale, with equivalent <i>pro rata</i> resources and staff as in the North. Mr. McDowell refused, however, saying that the scale of the problems within An Garda Síochána were not such that it required that.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> We have had the Morris report since then and now have a scandal concerning penalty points. In addition, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission says it does not have sufficient resources to address in a timely fashion all the complaints it has received. That is one of the key elements, so it has either sought additional resources or changes in its remit to allow it to deal summarily with some of the complaints. That is one of the reasons I believe the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission has not been able to deal with the plethora of complaints from the Shell to Sea protestors. Quite a big dossier of complaints was handed to the Taoiseach, which concerned the way in which An Garda Síochána handled those protestors in Mayo.</p>

          <p eId="para_643"> I am also of the view that the issue of the confidential recipient has not been addressed. When he appointed the individual who held that post until recently, the Minister stated that he was a man of the highest integrity and provided a list of references in respect of him. That person has now been sacked and probably rightly so. Does this mean the Minister no longer believes him to be a man of integrity? What is the state of play in this regard? The Minister should have made a more lengthy statement to the House in order to explain his actions in that matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_650">In my initial question I wish to focus on the confidential recipient, Mr. Oliver Connolly. In the transcript of the conversation which took place between him and Sergeant Maurice McCabe, he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_651">Shatter would have read your report in detail, I know he did, he communicated with me and he will have read all of your exhibits ... the only thing I would have redacted was your name. Alan studied everything in fact I know he did.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Mr. Connolly also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_653">I believe you and I think the Commissioner has a case to answer. I think you have the evidence they destroyed you, a man has only got his reputation. You were just standing up for what is right if you ask me.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The Minister did not really expand on the reasons that he relieved Mr. Connolly of his duties. Will the Minister indicate whether he had discussions with Mr. Connolly in respect of the dossier he forwarded to him on behalf of Sergeant Maurice McCabe? Will the Minister also indicate if the confidential recipient conveyed to him that he believed the import of what the whistleblower was saying to the effect that there was a case to answer? Will he confirm that the confidential recipient communicated with him on the matter? Comments have been made to the effect that the confidential recipient seems to have spoken to more than one whistleblower and informed them about his proximity to the Minister. I am not casting any aspersions with regard to who made those comments. However, they were uttered. Does the Minister accept, on reflection, that perhaps it was a mistake to appoint to the very sensitive position of confidential recipient for whistleblowers someone who was a friend and who had donated to his campaign?</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> On the inquiry into penalty points, does the Minister accept that no one from the O'Mahony investigation team contacted Sergeant Maurice McCabe to speak with him or to seek his input or co-operation? Does he also accept that the Road Safety Authority highlighted the fact that not interviewing the whistleblowers was the major failing of the O'Mahony inquiry?</p>

          <p eId="para_658">I intend no disrespect to the Deputy. I will try to work my way through the questions he asked.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> Mr. Oliver Connolly - despite Members persistently making allegations - was not appointed as the confidential recipient as a result of making a contribution to my election campaign. As is well known on foot of my declaration following the 2007 general election, Mr. Connolly contributed €1,000 towards my campaign. I accept that it is popular for people not to believe this but I can quite adamantly and frankly state that said contribution had nothing to do with his appointment. Not only did it have nothing to do with it, I did not actually recall the contribution at the time of the appointment. What I did was consider who, in my view, was an appropriate person for appointment. Mr. Connolly, as everyone knows, headed up an mediation service called Friarylaw. In 2005, his service was named by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as one of the appropriate designated organisations to deal with mediation. Mr. Connolly was well known as a counsel and he had a good reputation. I had some engagement with him when I tried to encourage Friarylaw to provide mediation courses to solicitors operating in the area of family law. I did so because I was concerned to ensure that family lawyers would, in circumstances where family breakdowns had occurred, to resolve their problems through mediation rather than by means of litigation. I encouraged Mr. Connolly to provide a course for family lawyers. I recollect that I assisted him in putting together that course, free gratis, and that I might have contributed as a guest lecturer. Again, I did not get paid for my services.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> My association with Mr. Connolly was, therefore, in the context of his being a very competent individual who was engaged in mediation internationally and domestically. He was recognised by one of my predecessors in the area of mediation and I thought he was an ideal person for appointment. I took the view that, in the context of the job he was doing, it was important that he should remain at arm's length. In light of the fact that his job would require him to engage with members of the Garda force, I was very conscious of the fact that much of his work had nothing to do with the Minister for Justice and Equality. That work relates to members of the force making complaints and allegations that would be transmitted directly to the Garda Commissioner. A complaint or allegation would only come to me if it related to the Garda Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> The Deputy referred to a letter I received on 23 January 2012. The allegations detailed in that letter were of a most serious nature. Mr. Connolly was very anxious to ensure that I read the letter. I recollect that we had a very brief conversation when he was seeking an assurance that I had read it. That was the extent of our conversation. I would not tell the Deputy the date on which that conversation took place and I have no note of it occurring. However, I recollect that this was a matter in which Mr. Connolly sought to ensure that I had received and read the relevant documentation. That was the extent of our engagement on the matter, with the exception of the correspondence that followed from the response I received from the Garda Commissioner on 30 January.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">The Deputy inquired as to why Mr. Connolly's position was terminated. Approximately two weeks ago the Deputy quoted from the transcript that has now become available as a result of its publication on <i>Broadsheet.ie</i> and I recall him saying that Mr. Connolly's position was untenable. Deputy Wallace read into the record a particular quote which the Members opposite enthusiastically repeat regularly in which Mr. Connolly appears to state to Sergeant McCabe that "if Shatter thinks you're screwing him, you're finished". Mr. Connolly also made another comment of that nature.</p>

          <p eId="para_678">I refer to the Minister's point about the confidential recipient. What is his opinion of him now? The Minister said he was a man of integrity when he appointed him and now, rightly so in my opinion, he has relieved him of his post because of some of his comments. My other question relates to the Garda Síochána Inspectorate which was established to deal with the investigation of Garda procedures such as promotions. We have not heard much about the inspectorate in the time since it was set up. Some of the allegations fall into that category. Has the inspectorate been asked to examine whether the investigative processes of An Garda Síochána are sufficiently robust? Why will the Minister not state that he believes that both Sergeant Maurice McCabe and former Garda John Wilson are honourable men and that their intention from the start was to do good? Why will he not state that their intentions were honourable, that they wanted a justice system and the Garda Síochána to stand the test of any inquiry, that they wanted to make the system better and highlight wrongdoing in An Garda Síochána, not to the detriment of An Garda Síochána but to ensure that it was corrected? If they had been listened to, it would not have got to this point but the Minister has so far failed, to my knowledge, to state that both men were honourable men.</p>

          <p eId="para_680">First, contrary to the manner in which people wish to present it, I have not cast any aspersions or made any comment about anyone's honour. I refer to the statement I issued on the day when Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony's report was published. People choose to cherry-pick the bits that fit the narrative. I do not mean that Deputy Ó Snodaigh is doing that. In that statement I pointed out a number of things. I pointed out that in the context of both former Garda Wilson and current Sergeant Maurice McCabe, that with regard to the ticket charge issue, many of the serious allegations made against members of An Garda Síochána have not been substantiated. The most serious allegations were that as a consequence of ticket charges not being paid, there had been seven road fatalities. That would be a most serious matter if that were true. That allegation was very substantially investigated and it was not true.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> I said in my statement: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_682">It appears there have been cases where clearly laid out procedures for the cancellation of notices were not followed, for example, where tickets were cancelled by some superintendents outside their Garda district areas. It also appears that in some cases, detailed records were not maintained. I am conscious that even where correct procedures were followed, the subjectivity of judgments made in accepting petitions for the cancellation of fixed charge notices inevitably leaves room for disagreement on individual decisions. It is clear from the report I received from the Garda Commissioner that strengthened procedures and protocols with regard to the cancellation of fixed charge notices are necessary and should without delay be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">I listed a series of issues that quite clearly would not have been addressed without both of those members of the Garda Síochána raising these issues and I have repeated this. I will answer the questions from both Deputy Ó Snodaigh and Deputy Martin. I refer to the extract about which Members of the House are creating some controversy, where I made a reference to the level of co-operation. I specifically said, "It is only fair to acknowledge that these reports [of Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony] and their findings and recommendations are in response to allegations of improper cancellation of fixed charge notices." I have expressly acknowledged this a number of times. I am not casting aspersions on the honour of individuals. I would question a member of An Garda Síochána secretly taping other individuals. If that was happening in other circumstances there would be uproar in this House. </p>

          <p eId="para_702">The point is the Minister alleged non-co-operation. Obviously Sergeant McCabe was not interviewed by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony but does the Minister accept that Sergeant McCabe was never called on the telephone, texted, e-mailed, faxed or visited at his home by the Assistant Commissioner or anyone acting for him, to ask him to participate in the investigation?</p>

          <p eId="para_703">I again say that it was my expectation that he would be engaged in the matter and it was my expectation that he would be interviewed. The understanding I have of the matter is that the investigation that took place was based on the totality of the information and the documentation he provided which included extracts from PULSE, which members of the investigation team could access for themselves. I repeat my expectation was that he would be engaged and he would be interviewed. One can look at it in different ways; for example, from the perspective that there was a serious misunderstanding between the investigation team and a member of the Garda force who knew an investigation was taking place. I have no idea how that arose but Sergeant McCabe confirmed - not me - that matters got to a point where the investigation had been completed and a report was completed but the report had not been published-----</p>

[This is to Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney] I informed the Assistant Commissioner that I had seen tens of thousands of ...terminations on PULSE and I hoped his report would reflect this.

          <p eId="para_725">I repeat that Sergeant McCabe was invited to meet with a member of the investigation team on 24 April and he found that invitation alarming. I do not know why that was the case. Common sense would suggest to me that there may be fault on both sides. Common sense suggests that someone who had such a commitment to this issue, knowing an investigation was taking place and having been advised in the context of ongoing correspondence by an official of my Department that if he had further evidence or information, he should give it to the Garda authorities, would do so. He did not, however, and I do not see how that can be described as co-operating with the investigation. Equally, however, I do not understand why, as the Deputy put it, a telephone call was not made or he was not asked to come along to an interview. I think, frankly, there was fault on both sides.</p>

          <p eId="para_729">I have two issues to raise with the Minister. The first relates to the Garda Commissioner's recent appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, where he described the actions of the two whistleblowers, Sergeant McCabe and former Garda John Wilson, as "disgusting". What is the Minister's view of that comment? Does he agree with it? If not, is he prepared to take this opportunity to disassociate himself from that assessment of the two gardaí? Does he accept that this kind of comment only serves to silence people who have the courage to speak up about things that are wrong and is entirely unhelpful if we are trying to create an atmosphere where whistleblowers feel they can come forward?</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> The second issue relates to the Minister's appearance on "Prime Time" where he disclosed confidential information in regard to Deputy Mick Wallace which seems to have been based on tittle-tattle. In hindsight, does the Minister regret doing that and, if so, is he prepared to take this opportunity to apologise to the Deputy?</p>

          <p eId="para_736">I do not know the context of the comment made by the Commissioner. I am conscious that Sergeant McCabe raised serious issues, including in regard to ticket charges. In a number of areas he has been proved correct, and in a number of areas he has been proved incorrect. I also know that he has alleged that a variety of members of An Garda Síochána are corrupt. There has been widespread currency given to these allegations outside this House. He has conducted himself in a manner which if any other member of the force had so behaved would give rise to uproar in this House. We now know that he secretly taped a conversation with a senior officer, a transcript of which has been published and was referenced today in the House. I would think there are concerns in this area.</p>

If not, will he take this opportunity to disassociate himself from that comment? Surely he accepts that the whole issue of workplace bullying is a serious issue in our society. The message needs to go out to people that they are encouraged to come forward, not threatened in a way that ensures they shut up if they have something to say. This is an important issue that goes way beyond the Garda and it is important that the Minister should state his position on it. Does he agree with what the Commissioner said or not?</p>

          <p eId="para_747">I have to hand an e-mail of 23 March 2009 directed by Sergeant McCabe to my predecessor, Mr. Dermot Ahern. It reads as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_748">Dear Minister,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_749">My name is Maurice McCabe. I am a member of An Garda Síochána with the rank of sergeant. As you are probably aware, I have made a complaint in relation to malpractice and corruption in Bailieborough Garda district, Cavan-Monaghan, and these issues are being investigated at present. A preliminary report has been forwarded to Garda headquarters by the investigation team which states that there were indeed bad practices and bad procedures uncovered as a result of my complaint.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_750"> On 12 March 2009, on the front page of the <i>Anglo Celt</i>, it was reported that the chief superintendent for Cavan-Monaghan [he here names the individual] stated publicly at a public forum to elected representatives that the issues in Bailieborough were absolute rubbish and that he had been briefed on a number of issues and there was no criminality involved. How can he possibly say such a thing when he is one of the Garda management complained of? The investigation into my complaint is ongoing and for the chief superintendent for Cavan-Monaghan to openly speak about the investigation and conclude that all issues were absolute rubbish is appalling. Certain serious matters have been uncovered during the investigation. To call them absolute rubbish is Donegal all over again.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_751"> My e-mail to you is to ask for an independent person to oversee the investigation because the whole investigation has been tainted and undermined by his comments. I feel it is the only way that the truth will be uncovered. The chief superintendent remaining in charge of Cavan-Monaghan while the investigations are ongoing is severely hampering potential Garda witnesses to come forward and tell the truth as they afraid to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">He then concludes:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_753">I am sorry for annoying you, but I am at a loss as to where to turn to. Certain spin can be offered by certain Garda management, but the facts and evidence that I have... will show that the public and victims of crime were treated very badly by certain gardaí. This behaviour was allowed to happen and continue by Garda management.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">On 11 May 2009, there was a brief response to Garda McCabe's letter of 23 March 2009, as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_755">Dear Sergeant McCabe,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_756">I am directed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Dermot Ahern, to refer to your e-mail regarding alleged malpractice and corruption in Bailieborough Garda district (Cavan-Monaghan) and ongoing investigation into same. The conduct of an investigation is a matter for the Commissioner in accordance with the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and the Minister has no role in directing him in such operational matters. The Minister believes that in the circumstances, the most appropriate action for now is to allow the Commissioner to complete his work and let due process take its course. I hope the foregoing is of assistance.</p>

          <p eId="para_781">I am picking up on where I stopped the last day. We are looking at the whole area of protected disclosures, which includes whistleblowing and bullying in various places, including workplaces, schools, homes, the Dáil and the Seanad. It is all a symptom of the same disease. It is timely for the various components of that disease to be addressed. On the face of it, one would welcome the Bill before the House. It shows an urge or an appetite to do something about something that is very wrong. At its most extreme, is it not really sad that for 15 years, Louise O'Keeffe had to keep enduring the exact same evidence that was heard in the High Court and the Supreme Court? Her case was covered over and blanketed down and findings were made against her. When it reached Europe after 15 years, this grave injustice and shocking abuse was properly understood for what it is. This suffering was caused by the atmosphere of pervasive fog that lies across this country in establishment areas, in professional areas, in religious areas and in political areas. The little person is always expendable and is always hurt.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> During his contribution to this debate, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy McGuinness, provided four excellent examples of justice being obstructed in an absolutely and totally unreasonable manner. This country needs to have its conscience awakened at its core. That is why a Private Members' Bill that consists of just 27 words is now in the draw to be considered on Second Stage. It seeks to awaken the conscience in this House and in the Seanad. It proposes that "the members of each House of the Oireachtas shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience". That is why we have to get our consciences awake. One could say that the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 merely plays with the edges of conscience. The other Bill I have mentioned, which could and should become part of the Constitution, is identical in its wording to the second sentence of Article 38.1 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and would serve us extremely well. It is based on the principle that underlies policy-making within parties and party discipline. It gives people the assured liberty of citizenship to do things rightly, openly and honestly, without fear of consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> I know people might cynically think I am taking the opportunity presented by the debate on this Bill to present a warm-up awakening for the next Bill, which is far more important. I have experience of what can happen with certain matters that need legislation, or do not need legislation as the case may be, in the absence of absolute respect for the dignity of the individual consciences of elected representatives and those who are appointed to the Seanad. Our system is a little different from the Bundestag system in respect of the Seanad. We have given a bad example to the rest of this country by having these orders and Whips, etc. Of course people can come to agreements on policies, as long as the underlying fundamental principle of conscience applies to those who have a platform as representatives of the whole people. That is what Burke talked about. Jesse Norman's book, which was written in the early part of last year, is a very timely work for us all to read in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> In recent weeks, we have spent a great deal of time trying to grapple with issues of whistleblowing and bullying. We have been skirting around what we all know needs to be done. It is obvious that a full inquiry is needed. Children could tell us that.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Children would tell us that as responsible adults, particularly as elected representatives debating and making law, we should have the full freedom of conscience to do things properly. It takes my breath away that Ms Louise O'Keeffe had to experience what she did through the legal process.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> The Protected Disclosures Bill sets out a formula, calibrating what is included and what is not. We all know when something is right or wrong. When something does not feel right, it is probably wrong. I got that feeling on two occasions in this House last year. First was the absurdity of the debate on the abolition of the Seanad. People argued that it was not the right proposition and then pressed the voting buttons in accordance with the Whip. It would be wrong to ask our children to do that and yet leaders of parties insisted that it was the right thing. It beggars belief. I heard good speeches supporting the idea of a second House for debate purposes, for new and fresh ideas, for courage and all those things, and then they voted it down.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> What does the Government want? Does it want oppression of minorities, oppression of ideas and oppression of conscience? Where does it stop? The Members of each House of the Oireachtas shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience. I am glad the Minister seems to be thinking about it. He should think and reflect, and do what is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> I wish there had been 166 signatures to the Thirty-Fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas) Bill. I do not particularly want mine to be the only signature. If it happens, I will be delighted take my name off and just be carried by the other 165. That is what it should be. Who is afraid? If somebody is afraid of it, then things are even worse than I thought.</p>

          <p eId="para_790">This Bill flows from it. Unfortunately the timing is back to front. I hope I am lucky in the draw. I mean it when I say that everybody can have a spring in their step. When we had statements earlier today, none of the Minister's colleagues were in the House. The public think we watch it on the monitors. While Members might do so, they do not get the chemistry of the situation. People have meetings. We do not have virtual families and virtual breakfast table discussions. If possible people get together in order to get the tone, texture, feeling and music of the situation. Those are the best decisions. That is why the leaders of the world's countries get together - they do not do it over the Internet or the telephone.</p>

          <p eId="para_792">Those are the precursors, the reminders and the memoranda following it. Let us wake up the conscience of the country. Let us get the Constitution infused. In his contribution Deputy Bannon referred to Article 28.4.1° of the Constitution, which states: "The Government shall be responsible to the people of Ireland." That is fine, but the Government is a tight little circle and can get corrupted - it can auto-corrupt. We are here as elected Members and there is a collegial responsibility. It is a great honour to be a representative of the people. We should not be afraid, nor should we be bound by orders or instructions.</p>

          <p eId="para_798">I will try to do so. The Bill is very much intertwined with the matter we debated earlier today. I acknowledge the valuable, important and forthright contributions made by Members from all sides of the House in the previous debate. The Minister will appreciate what I am trying to do in that there is an interconnection between speaking to the Bill and the earlier debate. I know the Minister will respect me for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> I do not want anybody playing political football with members of An Garda Síochána. I do not have to look too far from where I am standing to see members of An Garda Síochána, for whom I, my colleagues and everybody should have nothing but the utmost of respect. The rank and file gardaí do what can be a very difficult job at times. It is a challenging job that they have chosen and are proud and glad to carry out. However, it is not appropriate for politicians to play political football with their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> At the same time the Government has a very serious problem, as has rightly been pointed out already today. Unfortunately the Minister for Justice and Equality is completely detached from An Garda Síochána, from his colleagues here in this House and from the people who elected him. He seems to carry on with a certain arrogance that is not befitting of the job he holds. That might be a debate for another day or a different forum, but at the end of the day it is a problem. The Minister is an experienced politician and he knows, as do the media and the people, that we have a problem with the Minister for Justice and Equality. That is unfortunate and I get no satisfaction from saying it. However, it is not appropriate for a person to detach himself from a situation and try to push everything away, claiming he is right and everyone else is wrong. Unfortunately the country is suffering from that at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> Of course whistleblowers need to be protected but we also need protection for those against whom allegations are made. A person might be unhappy in a job for various reasons and through no intention of the Minister's could wrongfully use the whistleblowers legislation to get at somebody, which is not right. I know that neither the Minister nor the Government wants that to be the case. While we need protection for whistleblowers, we need fair play and justice for the people against whom allegations and complaints are being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> As Deputy Mathews rightly said, in society today we need to stand up against those who bully, intimidate and try to put down others. Many of us suffer from this in our walks of life. Some of us are tough enough to put up with it, but unfortunately more people are not. I have read some of the files of whistleblowers.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Their families have put up with a great deal; they have suffered in their jobs, and that is not right. Regardless of whether one is a county council worker sweeping the streets or elected to this House to represent people, in my eyes and in the eyes of the Minister every person, irrespective of his or her grade or job, is equal and entitled to be treated with respect and to be given fair play. The Minister knows that whistleblowers in the past have not been listened to or treated properly or fairly. I would argue with the Minister that a balance must be struck. I do not want political footballs being made out of any sector, and particularly not out of An Garda Síochána. The majority of its members are respectable people, going about their jobs, taking on the role of protecting society against criminals and wrongdoings but, unfortunately, where they have come across instances of wrongdoing and put up their hands and said they want to speak out against that, they have not been treated properly or fairly. I do not want to apportion blame indiscriminately or wrongly but much of what has gone on must fall on the desk of the Minister for Justice and Equality. It will be up to him in the coming days and weeks to decide whether he will continue in his role, but much of that will come down to the Taoiseach and his views on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> There has been a great deal of kicking the can down the road by the Government. Nobody would deny that the recent Cabinet meeting, at which a decision was made to appoint a senior counsel to investigate certain matters, is a case of kicking the can down the road. It is a case of taking the pot off the cooker for it to cool down a little. In the same way, it is hoped the focus of public opinion will move from the matter at hand and the hot pot that has been the issue in recent days will die away, but unfortunately it will not. In recent days the Government made a big mistake in, first, ruling out of hand having a sworn public inquiry and now saying if it is told to have one it will have one, but it has to wait until it is told to do so. The Government should not have to wait to do something that is right. The Opposition has rightly called for a sworn inquiry into recent matters. Unfortunately, the Government has played an excellent game of brinkmanship in yesterday's Cabinet decision to kick the can down the road by appointing a senior counsel to do a job and that if he tells it that it has to do something, it will do it but until then it will not. That is not right; it is not a proper decision. That is not what the people would have expected from their national Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> In regard to bullying, everybody in his or her respective role may have been affected by bullying. I know for certain, and pity about me, that I have been bullied by national media and by Ministers and have been wrongfully put to the pin of my collar at times. Lies have been told about me but I am able to take that on the chin. That is part of my job unfortunately as a public representative, but it is not nice. What about people who are not able to take that type of behaviour on the chin? What about people who are going about their jobs, quiet, nice, ordinary people who find themselves working and living in intolerable situations? If I thought what the Minister is proposing in his whistleblowers legislation would be helpful to people in that type of situation, I would support it. The legislation must be fair and equitable for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> The Government is faced with a problem, and how it will be handled will be teased out in the coming weeks and months. The Government has to examine its decisions and how certain people in government have handled situations they have known about for a number of years. It is not right that people have to go from Billy to Jack and back again with their complaints, hoping that somebody will listen to them. Since the confidential recipient in An Garda Síochána was relieved of his duties, members of the force have not had anyone to whom they could go when faced with a problem. I hope this legislation will be a change for the better. At least it will be better than there not being anyone there for them. The Minister will be aware there was no person in that role for the past week or ten days and that members of An Garda Síochána had nowhere to go if they had complaint. If the Government is addressing that problem, I wholeheartedly welcome it. I hope it will be a proper recourse with which members can engage if they have complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> More so than people in other sectors of society, members of An Garda Síochána, because of the various difficulties associated with their roles, encounter problems about which they need advice and guidance. We do not want it to be a free for all in society whereby unjust accusations can be made about people. It could be the case that a boss in a local factory might not be popular with his workforce and a whistleblower could make a false accusation about him or her. We must have protection for the whistleblower, for the people against whom accusations are made and a proper avenue for complaints to be teased out and debated in an open, fair and proper manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> The Minister would have to admit that the earlier debate and the debate on this Bill are intertwined. I did not like some of the earlier debate because it amounted to some people playing political football, particularly with An Garda Síochána. That is not right nor is it good for the force, on which we rely to ensure we live in a safe society and to which we look to uphold the law of the land in the best way it possibly can at all times. Much of what went on today was not supportive of that. I do not want collateral damage to be caused to the image of An Garda Síochána because this House and Government must ensure we have respect for An Garda Síochána. Some of the Minister's behaviour since his appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality certainly has not been conducive to supporting An Garda Síochána. I would like if he was here to contradict that, and I would like to hear him do so. I hate talking about someone in his or her absence but I hope I am being fair in my comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> All I want from this legislation is that it will work, will be acceptable to all and that in time people will say it is fair and that they can work and live with it. I hope that in the coming weeks and months we will be able to sort out the current difficulties because they have to be sorted out. It has been wrong that these situations have been allowed to drag on for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> It is painful to see people outside the gates of the Dáil seeking reassurance and support, and to have what they see as wrongdoings sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">That is no place for those people to be. They should have a proper place to go to and have proper redress of their situations. I hope that will happen over the coming weeks and months. I thank the Minister and again thank the Technical Group for allowing me some of their time on this very important matter.</p>

          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_812">I thank all Members who contributed. I believe this is the fourth occasion the Bill is before the House, which is because it is important legislation. I suppose events of recent times have underscored its importance and topicality but also its centrality in the reform agenda the Government is putting in place. I thank all Members for their very varied and interesting contributions, some straying well beyond the environs of the Bill itself, but that is the way debates happen in this House, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I have noted all the remarks made. I believe I have been present for all of that debate. I look forward to having more detailed discussions with Deputies on Committee Stage, and I know there will be a good debate at that level also.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> I want to respond to some of the points made by Deputies during the course of Second Stage contributions. There is a particular and understandable focus in the contributions of a number of Deputies, continuing today, on how the legal framework will accommodate whistleblowing involving members of the Garda Síochána. Section 19 of the current Bill relates to the regulation made under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 in regard to the making of protected disclosures by members of the Garda Síochána. I would like to advise the House that work is under way involving officials from my Department, together with officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, to determine how best to ensure a legal framework for Garda whistleblowing under the 2005 legislation is fully aligned with the principles enshrined in this new, modern Bill. This relates to both internal disclosures by members of the Garda Síochána and those made to a prescribed body which, as has been announced, will of course be the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> The intention is to expand GSOC's remit by making a specific amendment to this Bill which would allow GSOC operate within the architecture of the Protected Disclosures Bill and accept reports, complaints or observations from Garda whistleblowers or members of the Garda Síochána. The new system will replace the system that was put in place by the existing 2005 Act. Deputies will, I am sure, concur with my view that the priority must be to ensure the legal framework for Garda whistleblowing is fully effective, that it works, that it protects members of the Garda Síochána and that it is consistent with the principles of this Bill, which is regarded as world class. For that reason, I was invited to make a presentation on it at the Open Government forum last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> In regard to the comments made concerning the creation of an oversight role to monitor ongoing operation of the Bill, as I stated in my opening remarks, that is something we discussed at some length in the Seanad. I believe it is important that an appropriate period be allowed to ascertain whether the legislation fully meets the objectives and the ambitions we have set for it, and we are ambitious in this regard. This is an innovative and, as many Deputies have acknowledged, by necessity a complicated framework we have laid out to strike the balance for which Deputy Healy-Rae has quite properly asked, namely, that an accusation is not a fact until it is properly weighed and analysed. We need to have a robust, accurate framework for protecting somebody who identifies wrongdoing and wants it rectified, but also to protect people against whom accusations are made to ensure false and damaging accusations are not allowed to be untested. As with the normal balance of justice, we have to ensure an accusation is not definitive proof. We have, I believe, in this complicated mechanism, struck the balance right in terms of best practice in the most progressive regimes we have looked at, and then migrated it into this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> I will approach any amendments submitted on Committee Stage with a completely open mind because, as the Deputies opposite know, I claim no complete wisdom on these matters. Everybody will come with their own ideas and where good ideas are proffered, the Deputies will find in me a willing ear.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> The processes involved will take time to establish themselves. We had this debate in the Seanad. There will not be a huge number of definitive cases in the first year, given that is the practice we have had. We need to have a representative sample before we review, but we need to have a proper review and that is what will be done. It would seem premature to establish a monitoring body at the outset. I have provided, however, for a detailed review of the operation of the Act to be carried out within a five year framework, which, from talking to colleagues abroad, seems to give sufficient time to have a real feeling for the operation of the Bill. Needless to say, if any serious issues emerge regarding the efficacy of the legislation at any stage, I would certainly be very happy to return to it, and there will be a role for the legislative committees in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> Deputy Pringle raised a concern regarding a disclosure which might be made to the wrong person and whether the whistleblower would be entitled to protections on how the matter ought to be handled by the recipient in such circumstances. The code of practice being prepared by the Labour Relations Commission will clarify procedural arrangements for the making of protected disclosures by workers and the manner in which they should be handled by employers. It would be a matter for the relevant Houses to decide how disclosures made directly to Members of the Oireachtas, for example, might be handled. As was explained on Second Stage, the Labour Relations Commission is working right now with employers and trade union representatives to have an agreed code of practice. We need to educate people in the operation of this because having a legislative framework that nobody knows about would be worthless. We need to have trade union members, workers who are not in trade unions and employers all familiar with this new architecture. That will be the cultural shift I have talked about, which will ensure people respond properly, effectively and quickly to concerns expressed by workers in the workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> It should, of course, be noted that in regard to disclosures under section 17, which deals with matters relating to law enforcement, there is provision in the Bill for procedures to be established by Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas as to how Members are to deal with such information disclosed to them under that section. There will be a job of work for the Oireachtas itself to define its own Standing Orders and procedure. Therefore, should matters of law enforcement be presented to, for example, Deputy Mathews, he would be sure in his own mind how to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> I know this from personal experience. When I was presented with very concerning evidence in regard to the operations of some gardaí in Donegal, my choice was to go privately to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, although I was advised later that I would have much more protection if I stood up and made the allegations on the floor of this House. I had no protection, as I discovered, by simply giving them to the Minister. We need to make the Standing Orders of the House clear in order that Members can be sure-footed in how they deal with any significant information that comes to them in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> It is an unfortunate fact that the need for whistleblowing protections arises as a consequence of the ability of employers, both in the public and private spheres, to penalise, sometimes to the point of dismissal, employees who bring wrongdoing in the workplace to their attention. The scope of employers to strip employees of their livelihood or their potential for promotion, or just to make their life miserable, leading to permanent disadvantage in the regaining of employment, has long been recognised as a significant disincentive to workers to report wrongdoing. That is the cultural shift we have to address, and I have tried to address it in this legislative framework.</p>

          <p eId="para_823">I made plain in my opening remarks that several authoritative international bodies had given this matter consideration and made recommendations as to best practice in respect of whistleblowing legislation. The similarity between the recommendations of these bodies is so striking as to confirm the need for workers to be protected against unscrupulous employers. I have had ongoing dialogue with Deputies in the House. Bullying is pernicious but often people do not see themselves as bullies. People who are convinced of their righteousness and the correctness of their view can even bully people they feel are bullying them. It is a peculiar fact that I have occasionally come across in my workplace. That is not to say that all issues fall into that category but there is need for legislation. This has long been recognised by me and my party. I sponsored this type of legislation in Opposition and am really pleased to be given the privilege of introducing it as a member of Government. It is much more fleshed out and comprehensive legislation than I could produce in Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> It is inevitable in the context of an employer-employee relationship that an employee who reports wrongdoing will be the weaker party and vulnerable to penalisation, particularly where the employer is not prepared to countenance the reporting of wrongdoing. That is occasionally the reality. In terms of the levels of compensation set out in the Bill, it is correct to say that they represent amounts that exceed the norm for unfair dismissal and so on. However, when one considers all the evidence available, it is clear that persons who suffer detriment at the hands of their employers for reporting wrongdoing rarely prosper. It is a point that was made repeatedly by contributors to this debate. If anything, the opposite is the case and, more often than not, such persons suffer significant personal and financial harm. All things considered, the levels of compensation set out in the Bill are greater than the norm for a good reason and are fair. I am aware of Deputy English's concern about the issue of interim relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the Bill I have presented compares favourably with international best practice and, in my view, represents an extremely positive development in our anti-corruption framework. It is just one arm of it but it is an important step. I appreciate there will be other Deputies with amendments to propose. I hope we have a good lively debate and I want to ensure that at the end of our discussions, we will have a very robust legislative framework of which we can all be proud.</p>

            <p eId="para_831">I wanted the Minister to give me an update on the implementation of the sick pay scheme across the public service. In a reply to a parliamentary question two weeks ago, the Minister told me it was at an advanced stage of drafting. I tabled another Priority Question for the first question this morning but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would not let the Minister take it and I have had to substitute this question. I wanted to talk to the Minister about the consolidated public sector pay rates and top-up payments, but for some reason the Department decided the Minister should not be allowed to answer that question in the Chamber today, which is most unfair.</p>

            <p eId="para_833"> The implementation of the new single sick leave scheme for the public service generally will commence next month. The effective date for the new scheme will be 31 March 2014. The scheme is being introduced through ministerial regulations which are provided for in the recently enacted Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) (Amendment) Act 2013. The drafting of these regulations has been a priority for my Department working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel since the relevant legislation was enacted at the end of last year. The regulations are at an advanced stage of preparation. I spoke to the Attorney General about them. They will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible. Preparations are also at an advanced stage to ensure an effective roll-out of the new sick leave scheme once the regulations come into effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_834">I believe the Minister would have answered the Priority Question I tabled had his officials let him. I am asking him to go back to his Department and tell it to stop blocking him as Minister from answering questions and me as an Opposition spokesperson from tabling them. We had this last year. I tabled a question to the Minister asking him about the implications for State agencies that fail to comply with consolidated public sector pay scales by continuing to make top-up payments to staff and when the Minister expected to have the matter resolved. I know the Minister would have wanted to answer that question. Could he go back to his Department and tell his officials to let him answer? They will have some obtuse reason such as it was spoken about two months ago and, therefore, they think the matter is closed. They are doing this House a disservice. The Minister's Department is the Department responsible for political reform but it refused to allow that question. It referred it to the Department of Health. Someone thinks it relates exclusively to section 38 and section 39 agreements but it could relate to health or arts and culture. It could relate to many Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_835"> The Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland has been in contact with me and has highlighted various issues and difficulties. I know it has been through the Labour Court but the association was excluded from the Labour Court procedures. The association has highlighted what we have highlighted in the House before. The unfair treatment of pregnancy related illness under this scheme is not adequately dealt with. It discriminates against people with disabilities or mental health issues and the retrospective element is unfair to people who had critical illnesses in the past. There is a new definition in this legislation but some of the people who will have no sick leave available to them to carry forward would have come in under critical illness in the past but are now being excluded. There are people who have serious difficulties. I mentioned psychiatric nurses but they could be gardaí, firemen or prison officers. These need to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_836"> When the legislation was going through, I asked the Minister to clarify the situation whereby a person's half pay after three months could in many cases be less than the household entitlement to a social welfare payment if the person was on disability allowance and claiming for an adult dependant and their three children, but he did not provide this clarification. What happens in this case? Will the various Departments try to make a profit out of this at the expense of people's social welfare payments? I got a convoluted answer and was told to ask the Department of Social Protection, but it relates to the Minister as the employer in the public service in the first instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_837">We had a long discussion about this because I provided for this in legislation for the first time. We have gone through the legislative debate, including a Committee Stage debate on these matters. I accepted an amendment in terms of doing it by way of regulation in order that we would have a chance to lay it out in some terms. I think the amendment was from Deputy Fleming although it might have been from Deputy McDonald. One of the Deputies tabled it and both supported it, which I think that is the way to do it. That has delayed the implementation of the sick leave arrangement. I thought it was the right thing to do. It also allowed me to have further discussions. If the Deputy recalls, we were waiting for the final element of the Labour Court recommendation before Christmas.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">It arrived in early December.</p>
            <p eId="para_839"> I will not have time in these two minutes to go through the sick leave matter in detail but I have a list of questions and answers and it might be useful were I to submit it to both Deputies opposite. Deputy Sean Fleming raised the question of illness related to pregnancy. There will be critical illness issues, which are well covered and well negotiated. We have binding recommendations from the Labour Court, which have been incorporated in the new scheme. I can go through the details, but it would probably be of greater benefit were I to supply the list of questions and answers covering how the new scheme works, how it operates in respect of critical illnesses, etc. We can then revert to the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_841">My experience of the Labour Court is that it is very open to submissions from anyone affected by its decisions. I have never heard a criticism of the Labour Court's openness to submissions and points of view as regards any decision it is about to make that impacts on any worker or set of workers. I would be surprised to hear of any. There are structures within the trade union movement in terms of how sectors are represented. As such, the Deputy's concern might fall into that category.</p>
            <p eId="para_842"> I have heard the argument that some people want to be excluded entirely from the sick leave arrangement. However, if I had not done this, I would be facing questions from the Deputy as to why we did not have proper, standardised sick leave arrangements throughout the public service under which everyone understood what was allowed and in which there was proper oversight. That is what we will have once these regulations become effective at the end of March.</p>

The first of these transactions, the sale in November 2013 of the ESB's 50% shareholding in the Marchwood power plant in the UK, achieved a price that was in excess of expectations and resulted in approximately €153 million in dividends being received by the Exchequer in January of this year.</p>

As the BGE sale agreement has yet to be finalised - I understand we are not too far from it - it would be inappropriate for me to comment on it in further detail, but the terms of the sale will be outlined in due course when the deal has been signed.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> Regarding the second part of the Deputy's question, that is, how to use those funds, she will be aware of the Government's consistent position, in that the funds released from asset disposals would be used in one form or another to support job-creating initiatives in the economy. At budget time, I factored a total of €110 million into this year's Estimates in respect of projects supported from the sale of State assets. Some €45 million of this will fund part of the advance works on the new public private partnership, PPP, projects. As the Deputy knows, a big chunk of that will go towards Grangegorman, but I can lay out the details of that and the other projects. Specifically, €25 million will be spent on the Grangegorman project and €20 million on the advanced work on roads. The remaining €65 million will be spent on the continued roll-out of the additional Exchequer investment programmes that I announced last year, those being, €25 million on energy refit for local authority houses and an additional €40 million to the schools programme. Additional elements of this stimulus plan will be rolled out as the various asset transactions are completed and moneys become available. It is hoped we will have more money to spend once the BGE amount is clarified.</p>

However, I have allocated no money to that purpose, nor do I have immediate plans to do so. The moneys that I have allocated so far are all for the projects that I have mentioned. If the Deputy recalls, I announced an additional stimulus of €200 million from the first tranche of the national lottery sale. It went towards the same types of project, all of which I listed on budget day. I will re-list them tomorrow when I sign the national lottery contract.</p>

He also seems to be retreating from that position.</p>

            <p eId="para_875">As I announced when launching the new public service reform plan for 2014 to 2016 last month, I expect the State agency rationalisation programme to be completed this year. A great deal has already been delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_876"> The Government made two commitments in 2011 on the rationalisation and reform of State bodies. First, we undertook to begin immediately with the implementation of 48 identified measures. Second, we agreed to review a further 46 measures targeted at broader rationalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_877"> I reported last month that the original 48 measures, involving more than 100 State bodies, have either been fully delivered or will be delivered this year, apart from two measures where the Government decided on reflection not to proceed. These were measures involving the National Cancer Registry into the Department of Health and, in the transport sector, the merger of the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Irish Aviation Authority, which we were advised at European and domestic level was not the correct course of action.</p>
            <p eId="para_878"> The review process was completed in the further 46 measures that the Government undertook to review, and we decided to implement 25 of those 46 measures, involving more than 100 State bodies. That will be fully completed this year. In total, full implementation of all of the rationalisation measures – the original 48 measures and the further 25 measures - will be completed. The monetary effect is very modest, with the €20 million target set out in the 2011 plan being achieved this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_880"> The Deputy also asked about the number of new bodies created. As I have indicated, there are a small number of new bodies arising from the merger of two or more existing bodies, as envisaged under the rationalisation programme. There is still important work to be done and public service to be provided. The purpose of the rationalisation programme has been to deliver these services with less. For example, there are 16 new education and training boards doing what was previously done by 33 VECs. There is one new body called Quality and Qualifications Ireland doing what three separate bodies used to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_881"> Aside from this, there have also been a small number of other bodies established in recent years to address urgent matters of concern to the Government. Examples include where the Government had identified systemic failings of oversight, or considered a need for new resources to tackle priority issues around job creation and unemployment. I refer to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, NewERA and the Credit Union Restructuring Board under the Department of Finance, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board and SOLAS under the Department of Education and Skills, Microfinance Ireland under the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Irish Water and the Pyrite Resolution Board under the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, and the Property Services Regulatory Authority and the Insolvency Service of Ireland under the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_882"> The rationalisation programme needs to be understood as just one of a package of reform measures, many of which represent much greater savings than the rationalisation measures. For example, the Haddington Road agreement will deliver a €1 billion saving in the cost of the public service pay and pensions bill by 2016; the targeted savings from public procurement reform are €500 million over three years and €127 million in 2014; and the Civil Service human resources and pensions shared services centre, PeoplePoint, when fully operational, will have estimated savings of €12.5 million annually.</p>

I would like to go on to my second question, and then the Minister can ask me questions and we can reverse roles if he likes. The creation of quangos also creates a huge number of paid directors. That creates a power of political patronage, which all governments are inclined to use. During the last Global Irish Economic Forum, at which this Government was well represented and of which it approved, one of the more constructive suggestions was from ex-pats outside Ireland who offered their services free of charge to semi-State bodies. How many of these people, with great business experience, have had their offer accepted?</p>

The quango issue is a lovely thing to throw away, but when we specifically ask about the quangos we are talking about, we find the big expensive quangos are the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, the National Roads Authority, and the Environmental Protection Agency.

            <p eId="para_900">It is doing important work. We have a huge set of reform measures, with more than 200 implemented. I know that abolishing or burning a quango makes for a nice tabloid headline, but the real hard work is to save €500 million on procurement over three years, which are we going to do. We will save €127 million this year. To save an additional €1 billion on public pay took six months of hard graft through the Haddington Road agreement. We have established a new Civil Service human resource and pensions shared service centre, PeoplePoint. That is now well on the way to being fully operational and will save €12.5 million every year.</p>

            <p eId="para_903"> The deadline referred to in the Deputy's question relates to the cessation of general support for certain Microsoft products in use across a number of Government agencies. My Department has been aware of the forthcoming deadline for some time and has been actively investigating its likely impact on IT systems across the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_904"> Responsibility for the delivery of their computing services rests with each organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">My Department offers support services only.</p>
            <p eId="para_906"> With regard to the products in question, organisations have the option of upgrading to a more modern version or finding alternative solutions. Many have already done so by upgrading the systems concerned. These include my Department and the Departments of Finance, Environment, Community and Local Government, Education and Skills and Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_907"> The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer has engaged with other public bodies and Microsoft regarding the implications of running unsupported software. The discussions focused on the remedial measures that could be put in place and identifying those organisations that wished to be included in an extended support arrangement. As a result, an agreement has been reached with Microsoft to allow Departments and their agencies to avail of extended support for a range of products from 8 April 2014. The agreement will enable public bodies to receive support for these products for a 12 month period under the terms of a memorandum of understanding. The figure of €3.3 million represents a cap on the total cost of such support arrangements for agencies availing of the memorandum of understanding. Initial estimates obtained by my Department put the cost of proceeding with extended support without a central agreement at approximately €14 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_908"> It is a matter for each agency to avail of the support available under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, which provides them with a one year window of opportunity for migrating their applications and hardware to a more modern and supported operating system. Any agency availing of this agreement must develop a plan to migrate from the affected products before the expiration of the agreement to ensure they will no longer be at risk. </p>

            <p eId="para_909">Will the Minister explain what will happen in April 2014 when the cut-off arrangements will apply? What will be the cost to various Departments of winding down the Windows XP operating system, for which support will be eliminated in the coming 12 months? I understand some of the Departments will move to the Windows 8 operating system. Will the Minister confirm that the process will not result in a risk for customers in respect of the records held in the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality? These are sensitive areas and it would be highly unfortunate if any of this information were to be leaked. We all remember what occurred when information technology glitches occurred in Ulster Bank and elsewhere. Is it possible such problems could arise in this process?</p>
            <p eId="para_910"> I understand the issue was dealt with long before the deadline in the case of approximately 90% of the computers where the problem was identified. Why have so many computers in the public service been affected by the problem, which will cost €3.8 million to correct? How many computers or laptops will require the patch in the next 12 months?</p>

            <p eId="para_911">I am afraid I am not what is known as a techie and the Deputy's question forces me to stray into unfamiliar territory. The advice available to me is that public and private organisations throughout the world are facing exactly the same issue. The reason for the delay is that people liked the Windows XP operating system and many chose not to migrate to the updated system because they considered it to be less user-friendly. This was the case in my Department and, as I indicated, we updated our system more recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_912"> Supports are available and all agencies can buy into them to ensure security in the next 12 months, and they must have a plan to migrate to an equally secure system thereafter. This means they must update their systems in the next 12 months. We secured a good deal on the €3.8 million cost ceiling to be expended by Microsoft. The process is designed to ensure all agencies can buy into it.</p>

            <p eId="para_913">I do not consider it a good deal when one must spend money because a deadline was missed. The Minister may argue that the position could have been much worse but the problem should not have occurred in the first instance. There should have been proper planning. What role will the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer have in ensuring agencies do not run up against a brick wall? Given the Minister's acknowledgement that various Departments and agencies must migrate to a new operating system within 12 months, what will be the overall cost? Is the chief information officer fully equipped to ensure similar deadlines will not apply to other operating systems being used in the public service? I have only highlighted one such deadline. Will the Minister provide a guarantee that no other such problems arise in the public service?</p>

            <p eId="para_914">As I indicated, my Department does not run the information technology systems operating in all the Departments and State agencies. This is done by in-house administrative services. My Department provides a support system. I established the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. All public bodies have been made aware of the deadline and have been working to limit any exposure in advance of the April 2014 deadline. The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer has engaged with the agencies which have sought its support and assistance and has engaged with Microsoft to ensure all agencies experience as little risk as possible. Departments and agencies have a choice of either signing up to the memorandum of understanding or upgrading their systems in advance of the deadline. My Department and others have decided to upgrade in advance of the date, while others will avail of the memorandum of understanding and determine in the next year what is the most appropriate system for them.</p>

            <p eId="para_916">I have asked similar questions to this one on a number of occasions. My primary objective is to ascertain how the Department will decide where to lift the public service recruitment embargo. We are all aware of areas where public service staff numbers are unevenly balanced. This sometimes impacts on the productivity of public services. I heard on the radio this morning, for example, that patients are being kept in ambulances because beds are not available for them. That is the background to the question.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_917">Last month, I launched a new public service reform plan for the next three years. Building on the achievements of the previous plan, the new plan sets out ambitious new reform targets for the public service. It sets out a very clear vision for each of the main sectors within the public service, namely, health, education, local government, justice and the Civil Service. Underpinning each of the specific sectoral objectives is a recognition of the need for sectoral managers across the public service to better and more quickly align resources and staff to meet service need and identify savings to be reinvested in front-line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_918"> In the reform plan and the Haddington Road agreement I provided a very clear strategic path for the future of the public service. It is now a matter for public service managers to deliver the new reforms, embrace the initiatives set out in the reform plan and make full use of all the tools available under the Haddington Road agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_919"> I am aware from previous questions asked by the Deputy that she is concerned about the disparity between the number of public servants available in different areas. For example, workers in one local authority may have to cater for a much larger population than a similar number of workers in another local authority area. The Deputy has made this point well and I agree with her on the matter. One could also examine issues related to the disposition of nursing staff in providing a service to the same cohort of population. Differences have developed historically and it is very difficult in a time of limited resources to redress these imbalances. However, I take cognisance of and acknowledge the validity of the points the Deputy has made on this issue. </p>

            <p eId="para_920">If consideration is being given to relaxing the embargo on public service recruitment, is a workforce planning framework in place against which one could match numbers? Until now, most of the discussion on reform has been focused on cutting costs. A real reform programme must be focused on delivering services differently and redressing the imbalance in public service numbers to close gaps in services. Why should one part of the country have much higher class sizes or a much smaller budget for youth services than other parts of the country? Is each Department engaged in workforce planning and is this matched against the relaxation of the public service recruitment embargo? Alternatively, are people making a strong argument for relaxing the embargo and, if so, what is the nature of these arguments?</p>

            <p eId="para_921">I strongly agree with the first point the Deputy made. There was a clear emphasis on cost reduction in the first wave of reforms. However, we implemented the cost reduction in an innovative manner to ensure we delivered services more efficiently. More than 400 public services are now available online and we are examining the top 20 transactions people engage in to ascertain if they can be completed more efficiently and effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">As indicated in my response to Deputy Ross, we have looked at a lot of the back-office supports, including payroll and human resources management and so on, in the context of having shared services, thereby releasing money and staff to be reinvested in the front line. I was then able, for example, to relax the embargo on Garda recruitment. Along with the additional gardaí to be recruited this year, more than 900 resource teachers are being recruited and additional SNAs will also be deployed. We are using what I term the "reform dividend" of back-office savings to front-load front-line services.</p>

            <p eId="para_923">That requires investment in, for example, IT systems that communicate with each other. If a patient is left on a trolley in an ambulance because there is no hospital trolley or bed available, that essentially is a productivity issue in terms of the use of an ambulance. Everything must fit together. The Norwegian system, which includes a huge public service platform that is based on a good IT system, has produced gigantic savings, but they had to invest heavily in it.</p>

            <p eId="para_924">I wish that as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I had Norwegian oil. We could then have extraordinarily good public platforms. Norway has the biggest reserves of money of any country in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_925"> In regard to the Deputy's point, we are investing. We are investing to save. That is the reason we had to front-load People Point. We had to ensure we had people in training. An important part of the second wave of reforms I have announced goes to the point about management made by the Deputy. The notion that the number of trolleys and ambulances would not be in sync is a management issue. People take responsibility for this. The purpose of the proposals in relation to upskilling and training is to ensure people doing particular jobs are fit to do them. We must ensure we do not, as has happened in the past, appoint somebody to the position of procurement or personnel officer without any prior training. We can then make them accountable. The Deputy will be aware that a series of town hall meetings have been held to obtain the views of public servants on how these important issues can be addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_930">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10 and 40 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_931"> In 2011, my Department led a Government-wide review of the public capital programme which culminated in the setting of a new investment framework for 2012 to 2016. The framework includes investment of €17 billion across a range of sectors over that five year period. Since then, I have made a number of announcements in relation to additional capital investment, including in July 2012 a €2.25 billion stimulus package, which included a new €1.5 billion public private partnership programme involving projects across the education, roads, health care and justice sectors; in June 2013, a €150 million Exchequer investment in schools, energy efficiency and roads projects; and in budget 2014, along with the €200 million already committed to the national children's hospital, some €200 million from the national lottery licence transaction. Information on these projects was set out in my Department's announcement on budget day.</p>
            <p eId="para_932"> Activity on the PPP programme is well under way, with seven of the nine stimulus PPP projects already issued to market and the largest project in this phase, the N17-N18 Gort to Tuam road, due to reach contract award shortly. There has been active market engagement from investors and construction contractors, reflecting the growing confidence in the economy. We had great difficulty getting PPPs back on the agenda following the difficulties faced by the economy. Investment in the PPP stimulus package is expected to generate around 13,000 jobs. At this early stage in the process, most of the employment impact has been in the technical and advisory areas and a number of enabling works have also begun. This year, €45 million will be invested from the proceeds of asset sales to meet costs associated with those enabling works. Construction on the N17-N18 project is planned to commence during 2014, with accommodation projects starting before year end.</p>
            <p eId="para_933"> In relation to the €150 million Exchequer stimulus announced last year, €60 million was invested in 2013 on the roads and energy efficiency projects, with the remainder due to be drawn down by the end of 2015. It is envisaged that around 3,000 jobs will be supported through this investment. Expenditure on national lottery licence funded projects will commence shortly once the transaction has been finalised. I can inform the House that I expect that to happen tomorrow. Due to the wide variety of projects being supported, figures for employment impact are not available now but the types of works involved generally represent areas of high labour intensity.</p>
            <p eId="para_934"> As I have indicated, a review of the public capital programme will be undertaken this year which will include an examination of the scope for using non-traditional funding sources to further augment capital investment. I am very conscious that we are constrained in terms of the quantum of money that will be available to us. We are spending between €3 billion and €3.5 billion per annum on capital projects. For as long as we can see into the future, we will be constrained financially. We need to be constructive in terms of looking to PPPs and investment from other sources to ensure we get as much infrastructural development and jobs as we can.</p>

            <p eId="para_935">The national children's hospital is welcome, as is the construction of new classrooms to replace prefabricated buildings. I acknowledge that a great deal of work is being done and welcome the 3,000 additional jobs. We are currently experiencing a housing crisis in the private sector and in the social housing area. I recently read in a report that there is pent-up demand for 80,000 units in the Dublin area alone. On top of this, there is a huge demand for social housing. In the context of the envelope available for investment, can additional funding be provided for the provision of social and affordable housing? A large number of people renting in the private sector would like to purchase homes and have families.</p>

            <p eId="para_936">I am very conscious of the issues raised by Deputy Humphreys. There are many large road projects under way in the transport sector. We also have large projects in the education sector because we need schools to meet the demographic change. We also need to invest in the Grangegorman project which I believe will be the flagship education project of this Administration. Housing is a new issue. It was for that reason I allocated, from the modest sum available in the budget for additional capital over and above the public capital programme, €30 million for housing. It is an issue I would like to revisit. I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is concerned about rising rents and market forces pushing people out of the housing market. We cannot have a situation whereby we are chasing rising rents with more money from the Exchequer. I do not think that is the way to go. We need to return to some form of traditional house building. We are engaged in how that particular issue can be addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_937">My question is along a similar vein to that posed by Deputy Humphreys in that it relates to capital spending and the July 2012 stimulus package of €2.25 billion over a seven year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">For me and, I imagine, for the Minister the key issue is jobs. At issue is not only construction jobs because many projects are also delivering sustainable jobs. On top of that, if the investments are strategic in nature, then there will also be long-term jobs by way of making the economy more competitive in terms of broadband. I am keen to hear the Minister's views on the matter but, to be honest, I am not confident about it because I have tried to track various announcements dating back to the previous Government as well as the current Government. The projects take so long. From the date they are announced until there are diggers on the ground takes several years. Let us consider my area in Cork. Certainly, a good deal of money is being spent on education and there is a new prison in Cork but other projects seem to get stuck in bureaucracy. Is there any initiative within the Department to review how projects can be rolled out with a view to accelerating them in order that we can get the job creation benefits for which they are intended?</p>

            <p eId="para_939">I share the Deputy's concern in as much as public private partnerships take a long time to come to fruition. We had a major difficulty in the beginning because the market was so seared by the cancellation of PPP projects at the time of the economic collapse. We are going back to the same body of funders in the market and suggesting that we want them to bid for these projects and put in their money upfront. It takes a major effort. The first PPP we got over the line was the Newlands Cross and N11 project and that was almost totemic. Once we got that across, a growing confidence emerged.</p>
            <p eId="para_940"> I have a monthly monitoring system in my Department to watch all PPPs. I meet representatives from the National Development Finance Agency regularly and I will meet them again shortly. I met them last month as well. We are keen to ensure that there are no delays but there are several constraints. For example, I have asked for school bundles to be joined together where we have resources and if there is a market willing to fund it. Then, we have to deal with the construction capacity within the Irish economy to bid for large projects. I assure the Deputy that every possible measure that can be taken to ensure PPPs are delivered is being taken and I am confident that a good system is in train now.</p>

            <p eId="para_941">My point was general and not specific to PPPs because there are still few of them in place in reality. The difficulty is with the capital budget, from the initial stage when it is announced to the design and through to construction. It seems to take forever. It is not only the delivery of projects. Let us look back. The Government announced in September 2011, two and a half years ago, that we would have a strategic investment fund on a statutory basis and that some money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund would be channelled into commercially feasible projects, but we are still waiting for the legislation. The Minister is responsible for capital expenditure and I would have expected that such legislation would have been fast-tracked. Instead, it seems to have simply got lost. I know we are expecting it shortly but we are two and a half years on.</p>

            <p eId="para_942">That legislation does not fall within my remit but it will be published next month. That is no constraint. We have the agreement of Government to expend the money. We do not need the new legislation to allocate the funding and it has not been a constraint for me in pushing co-funding projects. That is not an issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_943"> Reference was made to non-PPP projects. There can be frustrations. For example, one project - I realise it is a PPP project - involves school bundles. Two of the planning applications were refused and that knocked things back and we had to start again. We were keen to have the children's hospital up-and-running by now but An Bord Pleanála made a decision on that. Then, we had to change the site and now it will take longer but it will be completed by 2018. We need to have construction started next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_944"> There is a frustration with these big projects. It takes time for the design, they must have careful planning, they must have the funding in place and they must have local community assent. That is the way we have. These things can sometimes cause difficulties. Even relatively small projects are faced with local opposition sometimes and those involved have to be dealt with, assuaged and encouraged, and the real concerns have to be addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_945">Reference was made to the Minister's efforts at job creation and the stimulus package. In particular, some points were made by Deputy Humphreys about housing. Does the Minister believe it is appropriate that Fingal County Council is currently offering staff an under-the-counter payment of €5,000 per employee to transfer out of the housing department? If we were to factor up that amount of money, it would be the equivalent of two full-time workers employed in the housing area.</p>
            <p eId="para_946"> My understanding was that under the Haddington Road agreement local authorities and organisations in the public sector were prevented from making any under-the-counter payments to secure deals on transfers. Will the Minister investigate this matter? The reality is that the local authority is proposing to use public funds to incentivise workers out of one area and to transfer to another area. Such moneys could have been used for job creation and at least two full-time jobs could have been created with the equivalent amount.</p>

            <p eId="para_955">There has been quite a public spat, it would appear, between the Minister's Department and the Department of Health over the possible costs of universal health insurance. There have been suggestions that the Minister's Department believes the proposal could potentially threaten the financial stability of the State. There is talk of vast costs for people who would be brought into what is, essentially, obligatory private health insurance for prescription costs and so on. Figures have been bandied around of €1,000 or more per year for what would be, essentially, extra taxes to fund this proposal. Can the Minister tell us what he knows about the proposals that are being floated and their cost implications? When will the Minister pronounce on whether this scheme is actually a disaster? Some of us, as the Minister is aware, are strongly opposed to this model and believe we should go for a national health service model, not what is essentially mandatory private health insurance.</p>

Universal health insurance is a priority policy area for the Government. My Department, given its central role, is always engaged constructively with other Departments to ensure that policy development takes account of the impact on the economy, the Exchequer and the taxpayer. Universal health insurance is no different to any other policy area across any other Department. I am committed to working with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and all the other members of the Government to ensure this policy is progressed. I understand that the Minister's paper will be submitted for Government approval and publication shortly. It will stimulate a debate on universal health insurance. That debate will be necessary and valuable and I look forward to contributing to it and to it determining the future for health delivery in the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_958">As the Minister is aware, those of us who are opposed to this way of delivering health care have made the point that universal health insurance is mandatory private health insurance organised via the State imposing the system. It is similar to the United States or the Netherlands. Things that have to be factored in to the system include profit for the private health insurance companies, billing costs, administration costs, legal costs and advertising costs. Is it the case that the leaked White Paper and the associated comments from the Minister's Department indicate an awareness on the part of the Minister's Department that when we add in all these costs, the proposal will cost us an absolute fortune and that it is a mad project to embark upon? As much as universal health sounds wonderful, when we add in the word "insurance" and we mean private health insurance companies, then the costs blow up out of all proportion.</p>
            <p eId="para_959"> Those costs will be borne either by the services that are delivered or through extra taxes imposed on ordinary citizens who are already burdened with massive amounts of austerity taxes and cuts.</p>

Will the Minister comment on them? From where do they come from and what does the Minister have to say about these costs?

            <p eId="para_971">On 10 January, the OPW wrote to city and county managers in coastal areas indicating that it will accept applications, under its minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme, for funding to assist with repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by recent storms.</p>
            <p eId="para_972"> This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre-storm condition. Any work for which funding is sought will be carried out by the local authorities concerned. The Government decided on 11 February that funding of up to €70 million in total will be made available to local authorities to assist them with the repairs to damaged infrastructure. Of this total amount, and based on estimates submitted by local authorities, funding of about €20 million will be available to assist with repairs to damaged coastal protection structures this year. </p>
            <p eId="para_973"> It is also open to local authorities to carry out flood mitigation and coastal protection works using their own resources. </p>
            <p eId="para_974"> The OPW has been carrying out work to repair damage to the flood defence structures for which it is directly responsible and substantial progress has been made in this regard. The OPW does not provide direct financial assistance to individual property owners or businesses which have experienced flooding. Emergency financial aid and humanitarian assistance is available to households under the humanitarian assistance scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_975"> The OPW is taking a number of key measures to deal with flooding generally. One is the progression of its programme of capital investment in major flood relief projects throughout the country. The OPW's budget this year for capital flood relief activities is €45 million and the biggest part of this will be used to progress ongoing and planned flood relief schemes in places such as Fermoy, Bandon and Skibbereen in County Cork, Ennis in County Clare, and the Dodder and Wad rivers in Dublin, as well as Waterford city, Templemore, Claregalway and Bray in County Wicklow.</p>
            <p eId="para_976"> A large part of the balance of the €45 million allocation will be used to progress other flood risk management work programmes which include the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Studies, known as CFRAM. </p>
            <p eId="para_977">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_978"> The CFRAM programme is a core part of the strategy to deal with the most significant areas of flood risk nationally and involves a more sustainable, planned and risk based approach to dealing with flooding problems. Under the CFRAM programme, flood maps for these significant risk areas will be completed by the end of 2014 and flood risk management plans will be produced by 2016. The studies will consider the best possible options, both structural and non-structural, for dealing with the risks on a long-term basis and, when completed, will form the basis for decision-making on capital investment by the Government on long-term flood mitigation infrastructure into the future. </p>
            <p eId="para_979"> The emergency funding of up to €20 million being made available for repairs to damaged coastal protection infrastructure is additional to the €45 million OPW 2014 capital allocation for flood risk management. </p>
            <p eId="para_980"> Every major flood defence project either undertaken or funded by the OPW is subjected to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis and only schemes with a positive benefit-to-cost ratio are considered for further progression. Cost benefit is, of course, only one of the factors taken into account when decisions are made to progress schemes as a scheme needs to be environmentally acceptable as well as being acceptable to the general public in the relevant area. Schemes which will be advanced arising out of the CFRAM process will be subjected to a multi-criteria analysis before being progressed. These include technical, economic, social and environmental criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_981"> This Government has prioritised investment in flood risk management by allocating some €225 million over the period 2012 to 2016 as part of its infrastructure and capital investment framework. This is a substantial financial commitment in current difficult conditions and underlines the priority the Government attaches to this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_982">What moneys have been allocated by the Minister of State's Department? I understand he has a co-ordination role in this with other Departments, including the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. What moneys have been allocated to local authorities since the storms at the beginning of January? My understanding is that no money has been allocated. Local authorities have been spending on road works, sea defences, graveyards and piers, yet no hard cash has been allocated to them. Perhaps the Minister of State can outline what hard cash has been allocated to the various local authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_983">Substantial works have already begun, as the Deputy knows. Local authorities are already spending and have been told to keep on doing so, so that we can recoup the money for them after they have spent it. That has been the clear indication we have given to local authorities since the initial storm damage in the first few days of this year. The Government's assessment, based on local authority estimates, is that up to €70 million may well be required this year. We have a variety of schemes operated through my own Department, as well as the Departments referred to by the Deputy, whereby local authorities can apply for funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_984"> As regards the figure of €20 million allocated for flood defences, I will take the Deputy's own county of Galway as an example. According to the Galway county manager, we reckon that €1.25 million will be required for Galway city and county's flood defences this year. In that case therefore Galway city and county will apply to us under the minor works scheme. I have already told this House that I want those schemes turned around within ten days of hitting our desk in the Office of Public Works. That is what is currently happening. The moneys are already being sent to local authorities, but they must apply to us as is normally the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_987">The Minister of State says he told them to keep spending, but we know what will happen. They will send in the bills and the Minister of State will say, "Hang on a second, we did not agree to that particular project". They need a specific allocation of money. In discussions I have had with Galway County Council, officials made if clear that they require an actual commitment of cash. In other words, they want approval letters, rather than being told "You keep spending it, and you'll be all right". That is what is happening at the moment, but it is about time the Minister of State put his money where his mouth is. He should put the money on the table for local authorities. It is not a large amount of money because they will be slow enough spending it, but it is a huge exposure. I have been told that Galway County Council is out of money. It has used up every kitty to try to do emergency work because it has received no money yet from the Government for roads, piers or coastal defences.</p>

I assure the Deputy that there is no lack of effort on the part of the staff of the OPW in respect of this matter. I hope the insurance industry will sign up to the memorandum to which I refer and accept its responsibility in respect of this matter, particularly in light of the significant amount of funding - some €250 million - that will be provided to the OPW over a five-year period in order that it might proceed with flood prevention schemes throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_998">Obviously. In any event, the Deputy is aware that the Government has allocated €70 million in respect of this particular crisis. Local authorities apply to us in respect of existing schemes. We normally spend approximately €3.5 million on the minor works scheme. This year we will spend multiples of that. When the €3.5 million to which I refer is spent, we will obtain a Supplementary Estimate from the Minister, Deputy Howlin. That could happen in March, May or October and it will be based on the applications from local authorities. I do not want the nonsensical charge made by Deputy Ó Cuív to remain unanswered. We have spoken to the engineers and county managers on a daily basis and told them to get on with the task. We do not want any bickering or bureaucracy in this instance. They should spend the money and then recoup it from us. This has already happened in some instances. The Deputy might not want, for his own propaganda purposes, to accept it but we are getting on with the task of fixing flood defences. That needs to be done and it is our priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_1000">This question relates to gross voted expenditure - this includes expenditure relating to all Government Departments but excludes anything that is not directly voted for services - for the years 2006 and 2014. I will be interested in discovering how the two years compared, particularly as the level of expenditure in 2006 was supposed to be significant. I will be especially interested in hearing about the areas in which expenditure has increased and those where it has decreased.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_526" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1001">Overall gross voted expenditure for 2006 - I am surprised the Deputy picked that year - amounted to just over €50 billion compared to a gross expenditure figure of €53 billion for 2014.  This represents an increase, in nominal terms, of €3 billion or 6% over the nine-year period the Deputy has specified.  The 2014 Estimate for gross current expenditure is €49.7 billion, a nominal increase of €6.3 billion or 15% over the period while capital expenditure has decreased in nominal terms by €3.3 billion or 50% since 2006. While overall expenditure levels show an increase between 2006 and 2014, it is important to note the rapid and unsustainable escalation of expenditure which occurred between 2006 and 2009.  I am sure this was in no way connected to the general election which took place during that period. Overall gross spending increased by over €13 billion or 26% during the period in question and stood at over €63 billion in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002"> As the Deputy is aware, we have been undergoing very challenging economic and fiscal corrections which have necessitated significant expenditure consolidation.  The consolidation measures this Government has introduced have ensured Ireland's successful exit from the EU-IMF programme of financial support. To fully appreciate the scale of the consolidation, it must be noted that it has been achieved against the backdrop of being obliged to respond to increased needs for public services and supports. The numbers on the live register increased from 160,000 in January 2006 to just under 400,000 in January 2014. Pressure on primary social protection payments, such as pensions, working-age income supports, working-age employment supports and illness-related supports, also increased during the period. This pressure is reflected in the allocation of €19.6 billion to the Department of Social Protection this year. That is €6.1 billion above the amount allocated in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_1004"> Consolidation of health expenditure has taken place within a context of significant demands for services. The numbers of medical and GP cards increased from approximately 1.2 million in 2006 to approximately 2 million at the end of 2013, a significant increase of over 800,000. While funding for the education and skills Vote has increased by €900 million between 2006 and 2014, this was primarily due to the national training fund and FÁS transferring to the Vote in 2011. During the period in question there have been increased demographic pressures on services with the number of students at primary and secondary school increasing from about 814,000 in 2007 to almost 890,000 in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005"> While the provision and costs of public services remain the responsibility of the relevant Ministers and their Departments, my Department has introduced measures to help ensure that expenditure targets continue to be met and that public expenditure remains sustainable. The medium-term expenditure framework - with three-year ceilings for ministerial Vote groups - was placed on a statutory footing with the enactment of the Minister and Secretaries Amendment Act 2013. This provides greater clarity and certainty about expenditure allocations and allows for structural, medium-term planning and prioritisation within each area. On 14 January, my Department published a new public service reform plan which covers the period 2014 to 2016.  The new plan includes more than 200 actions, with clear timelines for delivery.  The implementation of the new plan, alongside the measures introduced to enhance expenditure management, will enable the Government build a new public service that is focused on protecting and improving public services within the constraints set by the overall national and EU level fiscal frameworks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1006">Is it accurate to state that the amount spent on education between 2006 and 2014 increased by approximately €1 billion? Interestingly enough, and despite the absolute chaos in the health service, the provision for health this year is exactly the same as that which was made in 2006. The allocations for social protection and education and skills have increased by somewhere in the region of €8 billion between them. Is this explained by the fact that there is a Labour Minister for Social Protection, a Labour Minister for Education and Skills and a Fine Gael Minister for Health?</p>

            <p eId="para_1010"> The Deputy referred to education and skills, the increase in respect of which over the period was €900 million. This was primarily due to the national training fund and FÁS transferring to the Vote in 2011. He will be aware that €500 million of the reduction in the health Vote for this year relates to the fact that we created the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and a new Child and Family Agency. The money in question has been transferred to the aforementioned Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011"> Regardless of whatever Machiavellian construction the Deputy, for his own base reasons, wants to put on the figures, there is no doubt that we have taken the broken economy bequeathed to us after his party's sojourn in government and sought to fix it. By the time the 2011 general election took place, the then Government was barely constitutional because it contained only six or seven extant members. We have rebuilt public confidence in our capacity to turn our own affairs, exited the bailout into which Fianna Fáil placed us and maintained social spending at a decent rate.</p>

Within our first 100 days in office we reallocated €500 million in respect of job creation in the tourism sector, with obvious effect. We tore up the promissory note which would have required us to make bullet payments of €3 billion every year for an extended period. Those in Fianna Fáil stated that this note was not renegotiable and could not be altered. Fianna Fáil also entered into a ridiculous agreement whereby we were charged interest on borrowings at 7%. We renegotiated this agreement so that the payments relating to it will be made over a 40-year period at an interest rate of 1%. We also renegotiated a reduction of 2.5% in respect of the interest rates relating to other loans. The Deputy stated that the Greeks were responsible for this and that it was nothing to do with us at all. When the Portuguese obtained a reduction of 1%, those in Fianna Fáil stated that we should seek similar. They indicated that we were a disgrace because we did not achieve a 1% reduction when in fact we obtained a reduction of 2.5%. That shows the level of our determination.</p>

          <p eId="para_1031">The post office network is hugely important to the life of rural Ireland and to many citizens living in urban areas. This is as true in my own constituency of Louth as it is everywhere else in this State. The closure of Garda stations, local post offices and the transport systems, as well as the shutting down of rural schools, is tearing the heart out of rural communities. Economic collapse and austerity are forcing a whole generation of young people to emigrate and this is having a devastating effect on the social fabric of rural Ireland in particular but also in many urban areas, although in rural parishes it is much more obvious and visible. There has been an increase in isolation, loneliness and suicide rates. There is a real risk that this situation could continue to deteriorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> The Grant Thornton report suggests that up to 557 post offices out of 1,150 face possible closure with devastating effects. I commend all those who provide our post office service, some of whom are here in the Visitors Gallery. I commend the postmistresses and postmasters who have shown remarkable resilience. They provide essential public services as well as a vital social hub for local people, particularly those who may be isolated. The Government needs to bring forward a coherent, properly resourced strategy with firm proposals to secure the future of the post offices and the 3,000 citizens who are employed in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> The programme for Government promises to ensure that the network of post offices around the State is maintained and that communities have access to adequate local postal services. I would like to think that the Government will keep this election promise and that the Minister will ensure that it is honoured. I ask all Deputies to support this motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1034">I am here as a representative of the people of Donegal just as all of us represent our communities. I will report on the post office situation in Donegal. In Greencastle, at the very top of the Inishowen peninsula, the postmaster, Cyril Gormley, sadly passed away. Very soon afterwards, An Post questioned the future of the postal service that his son wanted to continue. It was very insensitive at the time and the community was very aggrieved. A public meeting was held in Greencastle which was attended by a large turnout. The community made the case for the post office and it has been awarded a one-year reprieve. This is not good enough. They have no certainty about the future of their vital post office. In Carrigart a packed public meeting showed how much their post office means to the community. They sent a signal to all of us that we need to protect these vital rural services. I attended a public meeting in Gleneely in north Inishowen. The postmaster is retiring and the community does not know where it stands. The people are looking to see whether they can pull together and they will be forced to make a business case for what is a public service that should be fundamental for any rural community. This is not acceptable. Bunbeg in west Donegal has had a post office since the late 1800s. The postmistress is retiring and An Post has received a large number of submissions requesting the retention of the post office, but the community does not know what will happen. If the post office closes in Bunbeg, it will be the fourth post office closure in that parish in the past ten years. When the AIB branch closed in that parish the people were told by the Government of the time not to worry because the banking services would be provided by the post office. These are just a few examples of which there are many more from my county alone of how much the postal network means.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035"> The Minister has said that the social welfare contract is retained and there is no concern at this time. The postmasters and postmistresses and the communities supporting them want to know what is the Minister's plan for the future sustainability of our post office network. How can we be sure that we will not have to compete with supermarkets in big towns? How can rural communities compete because Tesco or SuperValu will not come to small rural towns? Will people have to go to regional bases?</p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> I want the Minister to tell the House about his plan for the long-term sustainability of our post office network, of our rural communities who are clinging to the last vestiges of their services. That is my report from Donegal and I am sure other Deputies will give him reports from their counties. I hope that at the conclusion of this debate, the Minister will give a cast-iron guarantee that he will implement a plan for the sustainability of our post office networks, a retention of the social welfare contract and search for other business opportunities such as banking which the post office network can offer.</p>

          <p eId="para_1037">Like previous speakers I express my support for the motion. The post offices perform a vital function across a wide range of areas and provide a focal point for rural communities; indeed, in some rural communities, the post office is the only focal point. I note that Fianna Fáil has belatedly converted to the notion that the post office system needs to be protected and enhanced. The party published a document yesterday - a copy and paste document - but I welcome it, nevertheless. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. However, it should be borne in mind that while Sinn Féin and the members of the Technical Group have consistently defended the post offices, the previous Government closed almost 100 post offices. The Fianna Fáil document refers to 211 closures between 2006 and 2012 but it does not mention that the party was in power during that period.</p>

          <p eId="para_1039">Copy and paste, Deputy Dooley. A large number of post offices have closed in County Laois, in Ballyroan, Castletown, Timahoe, the Heath, Ballaghmore and Emo. These closures have removed a vital local service and struck at the heart of those communities. Apart from the practical issues involved such as the need to travel elsewhere to conduct business, closures are regarded as another step towards running down our villages and communities when we should be doing the opposite. In common with the Technical Group, Sinn Féin demands that the current services, such as social welfare payments, continue to be provided and that services be expanded and developed. Social protection payments must be retained by the post office. As the motion states, a significant number of people do not have a bank account. Several of my constituents do not have bank accounts. Almost 25% of the population has no access to the Internet and in rural areas among the elderly group who use the post office that figure would be far higher. The reverse is probably the case in that 75% of those people have no access to the Internet or to computers. I argue in favour of giving post offices more responsibility for services such as motor tax renewal and commercial rates, rent payments and many other local government and government services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> I appeal to the Minister to ask his Cabinet colleagues what other services could be farmed out to this vital local service. The Minister will give his answer in his concluding remarks but I ask him to go the extra mile and consider what extra services can be offered in the post office network. Some rural areas do not have ATM services. Many post offices could provide banking services on an agency basis. If some of our proposals and those of others were used, they could revitalise the post office services and this in turn would be significant in re-invigorating villages and small towns. I was in Ballinakill the other evening and I can see the importance of the post office as a hub of activity. We must try to build on that hub and ensure that post offices are kept not for the sake of it, but as a vital part of the local economy and to ensure the future of our villages and towns. </p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> I ask Deputies to leave party politics aside and to support this motion. How can the Government vote against having a plan? We have heard all the talk about looking after rural Ireland and rural development. Here is the one single act that this Government can do during its term to breathe life back into small towns and villages such as some of the places I have named. We need that plan and I ask Deputies not to vote against it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1043">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate about the sustainability of An Post. I thank the Technical Group for bringing the motion before the House. I recently tabled a Topical Issue matter in which I discussed the change that is required imminently to secure the viability of the post office network. The main point I made was that following the announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, of a new reform package, an essential element of which is the availability of a standard bank account for every citizen, An Post should immediately be given a banking licence and thereby enabled to roll out that service to the 30% of the population who do not do business with banks and would consider their local post office the natural place in which to carry out such financial transactions. I also pointed out that in addition to this cohort of potential customers, there are other opportunities arising out of the policy of mainstream banks to close branches. AIB, for example, already provides a limited but useful service in some post offices where branches have been closed. Other banks should be encouraged to do likewise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> The recent awarding of the social welfare contract to An Post is welcome. However, the Department of Social Protection seems to be doing everything possible to encourage social welfare recipients to transfer to banks. In correspondence received by the Department, recipients are constantly asked for their bank details, with an indication that if such details are not forthcoming, their payments may be disrupted. If Government policy is to help post offices to stay open, particularly in rural areas, then there is an obligation on all Departments and State agencies to comply fully with that policy. An Post is a wholly-owned State company and, as such, it should not only be implementing Government policy but constantly looking for ways actively to promote it. I was in contact recently with An Post to ask what progress has been made in setting up a banking structure. While I did receive a reply, I did not detect any real urgency on the company's part in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> The question must be asked as to how An Post failed to win the tender for the processing of driving licences. It seems inconceivable that an organisation like this, with an established network of offices and staff, could be outbid by an organisation that had no source office or staff to do the job. It is also hard to understand why the tender was designed in such a way as to confine the number of offices to 34 to serve the entire country when An Post would have been able to provide almost 1,100 such offices. Any decision made by the Government or by individual Departments should take into account the overarching policy decision to keep the post offices open.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> An Post should be encouraged to examine innovative ways of providing new and profitable services by using the enormous asset it has in the post office network. People in decision-making positions must fulfil their democratic responsibility to adhere to Government policy. I am not at all sure, however, that some of them realise the consequences of the enforced closure of post offices. As it stands, many of them are on the edge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> I conclude by highlighting the potential for fraud prevention that may follow from encouraging more people to have their social welfare payments done through the post office. Where such payments are processed by banks, they can be accessed from anywhere in the world. In many cases, those payments are going to people who, for one reason or another, are no longer entitled to them. The cost of this to the Exchequer is evident. Last year, An Post returned €7 million in unclaimed payments to the Department of Social Protection while the banks did not return a single cent. Assuming the same level of fraud among bank customers as among post office customers, that suggests a loss of €7 million to the State.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Creed<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1048">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and commend Deputy Seamus Healy on his foresight in tabling this motion. I thank my Government colleague, Deputy Eamonn Maloney, who is unavoidably absent, for giving me his time. Setting aside the motion and the amendment, there is an opportunity to harness the goodwill that exists to deliver a viable future for the post office network. The ideas coming forward in this debate are worth taking on board in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> The renewal of the social welfare contract, worth €9 billion in 2014 via 40 million transactions, is perhaps the most significant source of revenue for An Post and, as such, is very welcome. However, while signing the contract is important, it is equally important to ensure neither An Post, by virtue of reductions in the fee per transaction to individual postmasters, nor the Department of Social Protection is allowed to diminish in any way our commitment to the post office network by encouraging social welfare recipients to choose an alternative form of payment. That requires administrative vigilance and I hope the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, will follow up on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> To be clear, there is no Government agenda to close the post office network. My colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan, referred last night to Mweelin and Ballingeary in my own constituency. Those closures are undoubtedly a setback for the communities concerned. However, an examination of the statistics is interesting. We see, for example, that between 2006 and 2010, 197 post offices closed, but there have been only 17 closures in recent years. That is 17 too many, but it certainly does not represent an acceleration in closures under the Government. In fact, it is to the credit of this Administration that the programme for Government includes a commitment to safeguarding the viability of post offices. The social welfare contract is an important element of that endeavour, but it is not the only area in which action can and has been taken. To the Sinn Féin Members who have spoken about supporting the post office network, I would suggest that they encourage their supporters to pay the property tax through the post office network. Banks such as AIB have taken steps to allow people to conduct transactions through post offices. Bill payments, passport applications, Garda fines and gun licence applications can all be transacted through the post office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> My final point may be somewhat controversial in that it highlights the onus on communities to play their part in securing the viability of local post offices. In my constituency office I help people fill out social welfare application forms and it is disappointing to see a substantial number of them opt to have their payments go to a post office other than their immediately local office. I have been on the front line at a public meeting where there was a great deal of anger about the closure of Ballingeary post office, yet many of the people articulating that anger did not conduct their transactions in their local post offices. The Government has a significant role to play, but communities also can do a great deal. We must harness our efforts at both ends to ensure the network survives and prospers into the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1052">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important issue. Like the other speakers on both sides of the House, I fully support the post office network and the service it provides, particularly in constituencies like my own which are primarily rural. The Minister referred to the economic profile aspect of this, but we also must bear in mind the social element. In many small towns and villages the local post office is in a row alongside the local butcher, grocer and hardware store. They are all inextricably linked and many people who come in to use one service will also use some or all of the others. If we take one out, there could potentially be damage to the others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> I welcome the Minister's reference to a whole-of-government approach to these issues and the establishment of a sub-committee to oversee that. Can he give us a timeline for when that sub-committee will begin its work and thereafter bring forward proposals? My understanding from meeting with postmasters in the past week is that they see their future being based in large part around what is contained in the Grant Thornton report. it is not unreasonable that we would take on board some of their concerns in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> Other speakers referred to the importance to An Post of the social welfare contract. As we have seen, however, there seems to be a difficulty in that people are effectively being encouraged to move their payments away from the post office and into the banks. That is an issue of serious concern which should be addressed without delay. There certainly is potential for the development of an enhanced offering by post offices in terms of banking services. Many banks are leaving rural communities and, where they do so, they should be leaving their services behind in the post offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> Like other speakers, I fully support the post office network, but the reality is that I do not use it enough. How many Deputies in this Chamber would have to admit to the same? How many members of the public are in the same situation? We all understand how useful and important local post offices are to communities, but we simply are not using them enough. The Government has a major part to play in planning for the future viability of the post office network, but there also must be a commitment by communities to use their post offices. We must all work together to implement the recommendations set out in the Grant Thornton report.</p>

          <p eId="para_1056">I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution, although two minutes is hardly sufficient for all the points I wish to raise. No one has to remind me of how vital our post office network is to communities. I see it daily in the rural area in which I live. In fact, the post office is one of the critical building blocks of our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">It is where people do their personal business and meet and greet one another. It is of vital importance for small, rural, isolated communities that have no public transport. It provides a service for elderly people, who are so often forgotten in modern society now, for those who cannot find employment and for members of society in general. We simply cannot do without this service in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> Like all companies, An Post has faced many challenges in recent times. We should be able to examine those challenges together. An Post cannot rely solely on Government business. It must be able to look at securing new revenue streams based on services that could be offered, for example in areas like passport applications, local property tax payments and banking facilities. Post offices can do much more. It has been estimated that if An Post were given the power to issue motor tax certificates, it could save the Exchequer more than €60 million over five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> I was glad to hear my coalition colleague say the Government does not have an agenda of deliberately closing post offices. As a Deputy for Carlow-Kilkenny, I am fully committed to the post office network. I am glad to put it on the Dáil record that I am behind our post offices. I have to say from this side of the House that the Labour Party has been extremely conscious of the needs of the post office network. I look forward to seeing what our Fine Gael Ministers will bring to the table to ensure there is a sustainable post office network into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1062">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important motion. When postmasters in my local area started to contact me to raise concerns about this matter, I thought I had missed something like an announcement of post office closures. I am conscious of the absolute devastation that would be caused in villages like Narraghmore and Ballitore in my close-knit community of south Kildare if there were to be losses from the post office network. I congratulate the Irish Postmasters' Union on its well-organised and effective campaign. As Deputy Connaughton said, it has made us all more aware. Sometimes one does not appreciate something until it has gone. If we do not look after our post office network, the potential will exist for decisions to be made that indirectly lead to the closure of post offices. By the time we realise that, it might be too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> While this is a worthwhile debate, it must be recognised as part of the discussion that post offices are not closing. We need to focus on measures to ensure post offices do not close in the future. The previous Government presided over 197 post office closures over a four-year period from 2006 to 2010. Just 17 post offices have closed since 2010, which is a demonstration of the commitment of the Government and the Minister to the post office network. An Post also has a responsibility in this regard. At a time when banks are moving towards online activity and getting away from interfacing with customers, it is important for An Post not to follow the herd mentality by focusing on the online option. I suggest it should realise that its greatest strengths are its network throughout the country and its people. The postmasters in the various post offices have the experience to provide a niche service. This makes it possible for An Post to fight for new business. Plenty of possible areas of new business, such as motor tax, have been mentioned during this debate. The Government has a role to play. The public must play its part by using post office services. We have to recognise the need for openness and transparency in tendering for these things. The An Post network is working together with the Government on the formation of this new group. I welcome the effective work the Government social policy committee is doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1068">It is important for us to discuss the salient points raised in the motion, which I acknowledge. A number of points are worth making. One would be forgiven for thinking that a widescale shutdown of the post office network had been announced. Nothing could be further from the truth. It must be acknowledged that one of the most significant developments for our vital postal service in recent times was the clear commitment to the sustainability of the post office network outlined in the programme for Government, which was agreed by both Government parties rather than being drawn up by the Labour Party or by Fine Gael on its own. The report that was commissioned by Grant Thornton is based on the loss of the social welfare contract.</p>

          <p eId="para_1070">On 22 December last, a contract was signed for its renewal. That is the basis on which we need to operate in considering the motion before the House. This significant contract was a big win for the post office network in every respect. It was a big win for rural Ireland, in particular. Deputy Creed was dead right to outline what it was worth in financial terms. The retention of the 40 million social welfare transactions that are carried out through the post office network each year was a significant lifeline for the network. The approach that is taken must, invariably and undoubtedly, be based on a number of challenges. Reference has already been made in this debate to the possibility of a standard bank account being offered by An Post and the Irish League of Credit Unions as a joint venture. A significant report that was drawn up by the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications set out the challenges that exist and the opportunities that can be availed of. Everyone in this House is committed to the viability and sustainability of the post office network. My colleagues on this side of the House have set out some salient facts and figures that are worth bearing in mind during this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1071">This societal matter concerns urban and rural Deputies from all parties. I believe the problem that is developing in this area results to a large degree from changes in the modern economy. The post office network, which operates in urban and rural Ireland, has traditionally been very well respected and still is. I have met postmasters who have told me clearly, in no uncertain terms, that they are facing serious financial challenges. This is essentially about survival from a business perspective if these people are to keep operating on the ground. I do not think any Government, regardless of its colours, should allow them to stop operating. In the past, we have seen great losses in traditional areas of activity in this country. I refer to the closure of railway lines and Eircom networks. Such closures are regretted to this day. We cannot allow further closures to take place in this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072"> There is no doubt that technological advances have led to real challenges in this area. We all know the difference between e-mail and "snail mail", or post. Features of e-commerce like electronic financial transfers are now a commercial reality. They are not going to go away. In my opinion, their use is only going to increase. What can we do about this reality? How can we respond to it? That is where the challenge lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> I suggest that a three-pronged approach across Government Departments is needed. It must be accompanied by a real determination within An Post to review its business model and try to attract new business into the post office network. The citizens of this country - An Post's customers - also have a responsibility in this regard. I challenge everyone, including myself, to examine how much business we are sending away from post offices. We might be doing it inadvertently or unknowingly. We all need to take stock and check what we are doing. This debate offers us a good opportunity to feed into the process of reviewing how we do business. We are familiar with the need to support local shops. If one supports the multinationals rather than the local shop, the local shop will close. This is no different.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074"> I welcome the Minister's statement last night that he intends to get the Cabinet sub-committee to review and analyse how the post office network can be given more support across Departments. I think that is essential. The key and the nub of the issue is whether we place a social value on this network. If we do, we need to move away from the mentality of Departments spending money in silos. If a social element is not included in the budget of each Department, accountants and financial administrators will automatically be able to impose cuts on any part of the budget that suits them. This problem is where the nub of the issue lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> I would like to conclude by focusing on three areas. Is An Post committed to retaining this network? That is a challenge for An Post. Do the people of Ireland want to support the post office network? That is a challenge for everyone, including public representatives. Government Deputies, including backbenchers, must work with the Minister to ask the various Departments and the leading Ministers to review how they do their business.</p>

          <p eId="para_1077">Like my constituency colleague, Deputy Coffey, I know people who recently went through the trauma of losing their local post office. I refer to the closure of the post office in Kill, County Waterford.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">The big concern at the time was that the shop would close and that then the heart of the community would also be lost, which has come to pass. The concern of every Deputy and every member of the public is that over time as business diminishes from post offices, the business of shops surrounding it in the village or town also diminishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> It is worth reminding Deputies on all sides of the House of the two Ministers who put the most business through the post office network at the moment, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, through the passport service and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton. Along with my colleague, Deputy Ann Phelan, I put the challenge to other Ministers. I welcome the announcement last night by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, of a whole-of-government consideration, encompassing central and local government and the wider public service, of the nature and extent of services that can be provided to the public using the post office network as a front office of government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080"> I see that as a challenge for the Ministers who are not currently putting business through the post office network. I point that out to my Fine Gael colleagues, who sought to lay the blame solely at the Minister's feet. The Ministers who are making it a viable network are two Labour Ministers, Deputies Gilmore and Burton.</p>

          <p eId="para_1081">I welcome the opportunity to speak. I was very pleased to hear the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, confirm last night that the Government has no programme in place to close our post offices. Indeed the Government is ensuring that the post office network is positioned to maintain its vital economic and social importance to our local communities. I welcome the many post office workers who have come to Dublin this evening, including many who have travelled long distances from my constituency in Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082"> We will not make the same mistakes of the previous Government, which failed to address the real economic challenges facing our post offices. It was a bit hypocritical of my constituency colleague, Deputy Dooley, to say he was shocked at the Government's lack of support for post offices given that his party in government sat idly by, as other speakers have said, and allowed 197 post offices to close between 2006 and 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> Two thirds of our post offices are in small towns and villages. The post office network is the link that binds our communities together - often the only point of contact for people who live in isolation. That is why I campaigned vigorously in the past for post offices to be retained in Corofin and Broadford in County Clare when their futures were threatened. That is why I want the maximum number of post offices maintained in local communities in County Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084"> Given the fast-changing retail and technological age in which we live where consumers, especially younger consumers, are no longer reliant on the post office but on the iPhone which is the main means for doing business, An Post needs to reshape its network to meet the new IT challenges. Having invested in computerisation, post offices are now equipped to become the front-office provider of government and I welcome the Minister's announcement of this initiative last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> The introduction of standard banking accounts, which should be done as quickly as possible, will put An Post on an equal footing with the banks. Instead of people having to deal with banks where they have to contend with reduced banking hours, longer queues and less personal contact, they could transact their business in the local post office in a far friendlier environment. A wider range of services should be available in post offices, as other speakers have said, building on the success of the passport express service. Instead of promoting online payments, Government policy should focus on encouraging greater utilisation of the post office network, particularly for paying the local property tax, motor tax, court fines etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086"> The post office workers can rest assured of my support.</p>

          <p eId="para_1087">I welcome the opportunity to speak. In any debate it is important to try to be as honest as possible. We can all admit that we have a problem here. The Irish Postmasters' Union and all the staff working in post offices know there is a problem. We will not solve it tonight and this motion will not sort it out, regardless of the outcome of the vote on it. Tomorrow the problem will still be there and we need a mechanism to deal with the situation. We need a healthy interaction between the legislators, the IPU and An Post. At the moment there is a tension - not a healthy tension - between the IPU and An Post and there is a problem there. We need to find creative ways of engaging in the coming months, not years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> I do not want to repeat what other speakers have already said. There was a great opportunity in 2007 when a Belgian bank did a deal to set up banking through An Post. Unfortunately that closed down in February 2010. That was the first step in this problem becoming a bigger problem. I accept that AIB has come in, which is a help. However, we still have a difficulty. This is not a difficulty that arose this week or last week. Three years ago e-payments by the Department of Social Protection were mentioned for the first time. We need to offer some kind of current account facility through An Post. It has the counter service. The post office workers are doing more work through their counter services than any bank teller. We need to work towards that objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089"> Other speakers have mentioned the social element. We could close down every post office in the country and locate them in the larger towns. While that would be an economically viable option, we need to have a socially viable option. We need to keep our post offices open in the villages and towns, in the heart of the community. We need to do that creatively. In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, he was very proactive when the Greencastle post office was under threat. He worked with the politicians, An Post and the IPU. That is the system we need in place for all the post offices and not when it becomes a political crisis and a motion is tabled.</p>

          <p eId="para_1090">I thank the Opposition for tabling this motion. The post office network is key to rural areas just as it is key to large parts of Dublin. In the constituency I represent there are many areas that have nothing other than a post office. Not only is it economically important, it has a greater social integration importance than any other thing in society. People working in post offices - the postal delivery people, postmasters and postmistresses, are doing more for people socially than any anybody else. We need to have a debate on and cherish the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091"> In the last three years of the previous Government, comprising Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Independents, 197 rural post offices were closed. We have seen AIB being brought into them. When the Labour Party was last in power we introduced the processing of passports through them. I say to the Fine Gael Deputies that they would be heading for a general election and not local elections if they keep their smart alecky comments trying to blame the Labour Party for anything other than a good plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092"> There is a certain hysteria at the moment with people handing out telephone numbers and asking other people to ring their Deputies. I am delighted they are ringing us because we are getting in a position where we can engage with them and say we need to provide more services, ensure the sustainability and keep the people who are here employed and keep them rooted in society. It is more about social dynamics than economics. The Minister gets that and we have impressed it upon him. There has to be a plan about sustainability particularly in rural areas. It is high time that we had an overall plan for rural areas to create some sustainable jobs and allow people truly believe they can raise their families in rural areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_1093">I have received a number of calls from concerned constituents in recent days regarding possible post office closures. In this regard I wholeheartedly welcome the commitment the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, made last night that unless there is a compelling case the Government does not want to see a single post office closed. This is a welcome assurance, as one cannot overstate the importance of the local post office particularly to a rural area, where it is often the heartbeat of the entire community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> The post office can be the sole point of contact for many, particularly elderly people, and it plays an important role in combatting rural isolation. As with many other services, the postal network is facing challenges. An Post has responded to these challenges and has moved with the times by securing deals with Aviva and AIB. I believe there is further potential to develop relationships with other financial institutions and I encourage An Post to explore possibilities and opportunities with credit unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> In March 2013 Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications launched a report on promoting a sustainable future for the postal network. Considerable work went into this document which contains good suggestions and ideas. It provides a basis on which the post office network can develop to suit the needs of the 21st century. All the stakeholders now need to come together and formulate a sustainable plan for the future of post offices. Unfortunately there has been a considerable amount of scaremongering in the past few days about the future of post offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> I met post office workers, postmistresses and postmasters outside here tonight and I welcome them here. I want the message to go out from here this evening that the post offices throughout the country and particularly those in Counties Cavan and Monaghan are open for business and will continue to be open for business.</p>

          <p eId="para_1101">I will begin by declaring an interest; I am a postmaster based in a stand-alone post office in Castletownbere in west Cork. Since I became a postmaster in 1992, I have been a member of the Irish Postmasters' Union and I compliment the union on bringing this campaign to the Dáil and to Government this evening along with the many postmasters and postmistresses throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> I recall a similar protest in 1997 when we carried a symbolic coffin through the streets of Dublin at that time calling for fair terms and conditions for our offices and our communities. My views remain the same and I still believe that if we are to serve the communities, villages, towns and larger urban areas, post offices will have to remain viable. The Fianna Fáil-led Government's response at that time was to establish an interdepartmental group of civil servants who concluded that the network was too big at 2,000 offices. It offered packages for post offices to close and we lost hundreds of post offices. In 2001 we had 2,000 offices and by 2005 we had 1,400. From 2004 to 2006 we lost one sub-office every two working days. There is not the response we need now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103"> I will be voting for a different approach outlined by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, where the matter of the future of the post office network will go to a Cabinet subcommittee chaired by An Taoiseach, not to the civil servants where that matter went in 2001, and we will eventually explore new opportunities for the post office from central and local government and State agencies. </p>
          <p eId="para_1104"> It is not widely understood by the public but postmasters depend entirely on the customers that use the post office to carry out their business. We are self-employed contractors who are constrained by many factors. Our business is An Post business. We cannot undertake any other. However, we see every day other corporate entities being offered this business. We are fighting with one hand effectively tied behind our back.</p>

          <p eId="para_1116">Before I came into the Chamber I went outside and spoke to some of the protesters. Some of them seem to have fallen for the line that perhaps their problem is solved but fortunately there were a few people there who, when I was talking to them, I reminded them that the Government has done this in the past. That is what it does in an election and in the run-up to an election. At this stage I am seriously wondering are we going to get a promise of world peace from the Government on 24 May because it has promised us everything else. When I was outside I met protesters who previously had protested outside this House on the issue of turf-cutting and I did not have to convince them that the Government was not telling the truth. As one of them reminded me, on 7 March two years ago the Government supported the turf-cutters and in a couple of months time I will be helping a few of them in court because the Government has criminalised them. People are not going to be fooled by this, no more than they do not believe that the Government is going to deliver on world peace, which I expect it to announce any time soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117"> Only a fool cannot see the value in a seed and that is what the post office is for rural Ireland and for many towns that are not in rural Ireland. A seed does not look like much, it is generally small, it is not very impressive but what is inside it and what comes out of it when one activates it is what is phenomenal about it. I pity people who cannot see the value in the obvious. Post offices where I come from are like a seed. They are not just about delivering letters or the core services that the post office provides. They are also a seed that can be built on, no more than the small schools (amendment) Bill that I introduced about two ears ago, which is another seed for these areas. Without them they cannot survive. Sadly, nowadays we are told that X place cannot have a small school and Y place cannot have a post office because there are not enough people living there. This has been my argument in the past on schools and it will my argument tonight on post offices. Instead of Governments focusing on why there are so few people in an area and deciding to close the post office or schools, we have got to turn that on its head and ask why are there not more people there and create policies and decisions that make it possible for more to live there. </p>
          <p eId="para_1118"> It interesting to hear that the Labour Party had to be convinced by Fine Gael to support the people. Well done to the people of Roscommon down through the years because we were never fooled by Labour. We worked it out a long time ago. We knew that it was never were going to do anything for rural Ireland. We elected a man to Dáil Éireann who won two all-Ireland medals in Roscommon in the 1940s and guess what - he joined Labour and we would not elect him. We are very smart. The reality is that the Labour Party does not give a damn about the post offices. It does not give a damn about rural Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_1129">I heard the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, say last night that unless there is a compelling case the Government does not want to see a single post office closed. I came in here twice in the last year and begged that a post office in Duncormick - a small village near where I live - be kept open. It was the last post office in the parish of Rathangan and more than 1,200 people in the parish wrote to An Post demanding that it be kept open and gave the different reasons it was so important to them. We had many people who were not computer savvy and many elderly people who did not have any transport. They needed the post office in the village.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">An Post said "No". We then looked at trying to get a post office into one of the shops in the village. Again, we got many people to sign a petition demanding the post office. What happened the second time? We did not even get a reply. I raised the subject with the Minister but he insisted that An Post is a State body and that it has to make a profit and must do this and do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131"> Unless there is an active approach from the Government, post offices will not survive. They are now going to be asked to compete with Tesco, the second most profitable supermarket chain on the planet. It is ridiculous to think that small post offices of any nature are going to compete with the Tescos of this world. The only way the post offices will be maintained is if the Government decides to maintain them and if it decides definitely that no more will close, no matter what.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132"> Last night, I was worried to hear the Minister say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1133">An Post may be the best-known and most successful indigenous brand we have. However, this will not suffice if it is not able to provide the services demanded by its customers in the way that those services are required and in the location where those services are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">He went on to suggest that people might like to go to the shopping centres for their postal services. If he thinks it is a good idea to allow the post office to creep into Tesco, he obviously does not think it a great idea to keep post offices alive. Many post offices, small shops and small pubs have closed and what has the Government done about it? Nothing. If it does nothing, these things happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135"> It is false economy. Villages are dying; they are becoming wastelands. What does that create? It creates further unemployment, social problems and isolation for many people. If something does not have monetary value, the Government does not value it, from what I can see. I hope I am wrong and I hope the Government will prove me wrong. The post office has social value and the Government has to decide whether it measures social value or just economic value. If it just measures the economic side, then the post offices will all be in Tesco in the not too distant future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1136">We have heard a lot of talk about how the fight has gone out of Irish people and how we have lost the will to protest. The crowds that have mobilised around this issue, from every part of the country, say that this is not the case. One of the Fine Gael Deputies said that the Irish Postmasters' Union should be congratulated on having made us realise this is something we might lose. The reality is that the people who have mobilised have let the Government Members know that they might lose their seats if they do not get the finger out and do something about this issue. It is as crude as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137"> We are subjected in this House, day after day, to a phenomenal amount of doublespeak. I would actually say it is the hallmark of this Government, epitomised by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, himself. On paper, they say one thing but their actions deliver something entirely different. On paper, they say that the post offices will not close but the reality is that, by their actions and the step this Government is taking, the viability of rural post offices is under threat. That, I am sorry to say, is a fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138"> Figures have been given on how, in the past period, 200 rural post offices have been lost. Deputies on the Government benches have tried to say that the threat identified by Grant Thornton of a further 600 closures and 3,000 job losses is no more, that they are on top of it and that it is just being exaggerated. I do not believe this is the case. I honestly believe the threat is real because of what has gone on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139"> I am a bit sickened by the game playing between the Government parties. We saw over the weekend the leaked memo whereby the Fine Gael Party was trying to mobilise its backbenchers to cover their own tracks by sending out letters and e-mails to blame the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, in a cynical manoeuvre that would say it had nothing to do with Fine Gael. Obviously, that caused huge disquiet in the ranks of Labour Party Members who are up in arms, the like of which I have not seen over any other issue and despite the appalling policies that party has stood over recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140"> While the Government may say it has no agenda to close the post offices, it has no strategy to keep them open, and its inaction will kill them unless it takes stock. It is a bit rich to be congratulating the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, on social welfare and passport contracts that predated them. This issue predates everybody and is not just a rural issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1143">In my constituency, which has semi-rural parts to it, towns like Rush have been decimated. These communities have lost a bank and a Garda station and have had their library hours cut in a cynical manoeuvre. Now, their post office is being threatened by Tesco. The idea that the Labour Party would stand over a massive multinational benefiting from this hollowing out of villages is reprehensible. This community, many of whom are present in the Dáil tonight, have been collecting petitions and objecting in the strongest possible terms precisely because, if the post office goes, other things will follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144"> Multinational superstores have already hollowed out communities. They have been a threat to record shops, bookshops, pharmacies and bakeries, and now the post offices are in their sights. Maybe the Blueshirts are happy with that, so when people collect their social welfare cheques, they can spend their money in Tesco. The people are not happy with that and those outside the gates of Leinster House are not happy. I am delighted the Government backbenchers are under pressure. They should be because the people will not stand for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1153">The important thing is that they keep up their campaign. There is something very strange indeed when speaker after speaker from the Government side says they must commit themselves to the defence of the post office network and they will do nothing to endanger rural post offices or post offices in small villages and towns, yet the Government does not commit, and presumably the very same Deputies who spoke refuse to commit, to support the motion that has been tabled calling for precisely that commitment to be written down. Instead, they call for the deletion of that motion and put forward an amendment which is absent of any serious commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154"> Of course, that is the truth. We can all express concern. We can all express in the vaguest rhetorical way our commitment to the post offices and the post office network but if we do not take concrete, real action to secure that network, then the words mean absolutely nothing. What is worrying from the comments of Deputy Harrington is when he says things like, "Well, it is up to whether people come and use the post office". Sure, the people should use the post office.</p>

          <p eId="para_1156">What is worrying about the Government amendment and about its whole approach to this issue is that, essentially, it is saying that post offices will stand or fall depending on market forces. If they can cut the mustard in the cut-throat competition with the banks and Tesco, maybe they will survive, but if they cannot, the post offices are gone. That is not good enough. What this motion says is that we want a concrete and real commitment to maintain the post office network in towns and villages throughout the country because the post office is more than just a business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">Just in case Government Deputies think they have a monopoly on this, we lost a post office in Dún Laoghaire recently. Small post offices are being threatened in Dún Laoghaire and small villages and towns just like the small businesses that are being hammered in towns like Dún Laoghaire and rural areas. Obviously, the rural areas are being worst hit but the problem is general. It seems this Government will always facilitate big corporations, banks and big interests and if they swallow up, destroy and undermine small businesses and things as important as the post office, the Government will just let it happen because it is so committed to this cut-throat market ideology of profit coming first. It should put the people and communities first and support the post office network.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1158">I congratulate Deputy Healy on bringing this motion before the House and I am delighted to be a co-signatory. The programme for Government states that "we will ensure that the network of post offices around the country is maintained and that communities have access to adequate postal services in their locality". It is disappointing, therefore, that the Government is refusing to accept this very sensible motion before the House this evening. We all accept that a well-functioning post office network is essential to communities the length and breadth of the country but that network is under immense pressure. As the Minister knows, 209 post offices and sub-post offices were shut down between 2006 and 2012. As I am sure he is aware, the Grant Thornton report warns of the potential closure of another 557 post offices if An Post loses the social welfare contract. Last night, the Minister said there are no plans to shut down further post offices. This is welcome but it must be backed with action, commitment and policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159"> We can learn lessons from our neighbours in the UK. Consumer Focus explored the long-term effects of closing post offices in Devon. It found that many consumers now have to take lengthy journeys to post offices at significant expense, that many people in SMEs have to travel long distances to access post office services at considerable cost in time, that 60% of rural post offices provide the only village shop and that in virtually every instance where the in-shop post office was closed, it had a significant effect on the viability of the shop and in a majority of cases, the village shop subsequently closed. </p>
          <p eId="para_1160"> I am sure what happened in Devon is very familiar to Deputies here and I would like to mention two examples in my own constituency. The first is in Arklow. The arrival of a shopping centre at one end of the town and a large supermarket at the other end has put the main street under a lot of pressure. The post office remains one of the reasons people visit the main street. To An Post's credit, it is installing a disability ramp and upgrading the interior of the post office and acknowledges the importance of the post office to the main street in Arklow. However, this post office, as with so many around the country, is under pressure. Any move to close it would be a disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161"> The second example is in Kilcoole. The postmistress of Kilcoole, Cathriona Whiston, was here last night and heard the Minister speak. She said she was shocked to hear him say that people show a preference for on-site provision of service rather than walking to a separate location to conduct their business. She believes the Minister is wrong about this. In her experience, people want to be on their main streets. She believes they go to shopping centres because their main streets have been let run down and that the post office is the only thing holding many main streets together. As there is no bank in Kilcoole and no post offices in Newtownmountkennedy or Delgany, her post office's over-the-counter service is vital for many people but, again, it is under pressure and should it close, it would be a disaster for the local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162"> So what is to be done? Mail volumes across Europe are in decline. An Post's mail volumes have fallen 30% since 2007 so change is undoubtedly needed. The challenge is to embrace the new without destroying the old. We need to renew the post office for the digital age without destroying the bricks and mortar businesses of our towns and villages. To its credit, An Post is trialling some innovative products. They include the online shopping channel, foreign exchange, Postfone and an SME digital trading platform. Much good work is being done by An Post and by the postmasters but they need Government support. They are asking the Government and Minister to come up with a plan and to lay out a vision for the future and a way of getting there. We need an inclusive debate with the Minister, the Oireachtas, the postmasters, An Post, the Communications Workers' Union and representatives of local communities. In that light, Deputy Healy's motion is entirely sensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163"> There is no downside to the Government accepting this motion before the House tonight. The Government should do so and in an act of good faith to all stakeholders, it should withdraw its counter motion and accept the motion from Deputy Healy.</p>

          <p eId="para_1164">With over 1,100 branches, the post office network is the largest physical infrastructure in Ireland and is a vital strategic asset. The Government needs to recognise the unique and vital role of the post office, particularly in rural Ireland, as a means of communication, an essential economic tool and an intrinsic part of the fabric of the community. It has social and economic values and functions as an integral part of the social fabric of rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165"> In the programme for Government, the Government made a commitment to maintain the network but in the past three years, we have not seen any strategic plan or action to accompany and deliver on this aspiration. Up to now, it has only been a pious platitude. If it is not delivered on immediately, it will be the death knell for many of our post offices. The recent decision to set up 34 centres for driving licence application processing was an ideal opportunity for the Government. The post office structure was the ideal local centre of convenience for the general public but instead many people have to spend up a half a day and sometimes a full day travelling long distances to central venues that are many miles from their homes. </p>
          <p eId="para_1166"> Social welfare payments are the mainstay of post offices' business. On average, it amounts to about one third of gross income but, ironically, following the Department of Social Protection signing up to a new two-year contract with An Post, a representative from the Irish Postmasters' Union who attended a meeting of the Oireachtas committee gave us a copy of a document sent to a social welfare recipient by the Department. The document asked the recipient to sign up for payments made by electronic systems through the bank. This was to the exclusion of the option of going to a post office. This needs to be addressed in the short term and post offices need to be immediately equipped through the provision of a full banking infrastructure operated by An Post that would enable the network to facilitate the Department of Social Protection strategy to move to e-payments. Now that An Post is involved in a consortium dispensing national lottery tickets, that facility needs to be available in all post offices. It would help their viability.</p>

          <p eId="para_1167">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak here tonight on such an important issue - one that affects the backbone of our society. I congratulate Deputy Healy and the Technical Group on bringing this Private Members' motion before the House. I ask the Minister not to attack the most vulnerable in our society and to pledge Government support for the post office network. I ask him to work with the Irish Postmasters' Union and rather than downgrade services, increase the range and type of services that post offices can offer. He should provide facilities for people to pay motor tax, water charges and other local authority payments. He should allow members of the public to renew their driving licences, update the register of electors, complete forms electronically or pay hospital charges. There are many opportunities to upgrade and improve the network which will not only increase efficiency and result in net savings for the Exchequer, but make life easier for people, especially those in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> In 2012, Grant Thornton was commissioned to undertake an independent review of the post office service. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to its document assessing the post office network, which highlights all of the opportunities that exist to strengthen and develop the post office network while making public services more efficient. </p>
          <p eId="para_1169">It would also signal strong support for rural, disadvantaged and isolated communities that traditionally rely on the post office for basic services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170"> I will cite the document prepared by the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, on what will happen if the Government does not produce a plan. It reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1171">Post Offices will close, communities will suffer - and the disadvantaged will suffer disproportionately. Rural communities will suffer both socially and economically while disadvantaged urban areas ... will also be badly affected ... If the Post Office is lost the heart of the community is gone. The social impact will be devastating.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">I compliment the IPU on its excellent presentation to Oireachtas Members in recent weeks and I call on all Deputies with rural constituencies to support this motion.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Fergus O'Dowd)<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1174">The Government has listened carefully to all the points made by Members on all sides of the House during this important debate on the future sustainability of the post office network. It is clear to everyone that the passion with which all speakers have addressed the debate demonstrates the widespread regard, trust and loyalty for the nationwide network of post offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175"> Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, expressed his disappointment at the recent headlines asserting that 557 post offices were to close and at the impression that was circulating that somewhere, somehow, the Government had announced a plan to shut down post offices. I reiterate that there is no such Government plan. The headlines have emanated from a consultancy report for the IPU that presumes the loss of the social welfare contract and calculates that such a loss would, in the worst case, lead to the closure of a significant number of post offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176"> The fact of the matter is that the post office network is a unique social, cultural and financial institution that makes a vital contribution to the economy. The professionalism of the postmasters, the unions and the board and management of An Post has served the network well through the years and there is no reason this should not continue to be the case in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177"> The Minister and I have listened carefully to the various points and issues raised by Deputies over the two nights of this debate. It has highlighted the wide range of issues for consideration by all stakeholders when taking account of the future sustainability of the network. Post offices have moved with the times in recent years and now the over-the-counter business offers many more services than were offered previously, including foreign exchange, passport services, bank agency services and tax payment services. This demonstrates the commercial acumen and adaptability of An Post as a company and its staff, postmasters and unions to seek out, win and deliver on new business opportunities to meet customer demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178"> As a further fillip to the quest for new business opportunities for the post office network, the Government has decided on a whole-of-government approach, encompassing central and local government and the wider public service, with an eye to the nature and extent of services that can be provided to the public by using the post office network as a front office of government, as it were. This will afford an opportunity for a wide-ranging review of the services that could be delivered by the post office network and perhaps yield synergies among the various agencies. Deputies have queried whether there is a timeline for the Cabinet sub-committee to conclude its work. The Minister expects this work to be concluded inside six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179"> It is a modern day reality that technological change, consumer choice and expectations and the actions of An Post's competitors will give rise to further significant challenges in the coming years. The road ahead will not necessarily be easy, but nothing will be gained by standing still. The Government's priority is for An Post to be in a position to compete for and win contracts for payment services independent of the technology platform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180"> We welcome this opportunity for a debate on the future sustainability of the post office network, as it has provided a useful forum for many views to be aired. As the debate draws to a conclusion, it is hoped that the announcement regarding the whole-of-government consideration in respect of the use of the post office network as a front office of government will allay the many concerns expressed and pave the way for an informed approach and new developments in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181"> Notwithstanding the inevitable further challenges that lie ahead, I once again convey the support of the Government for the post office network. I am pleased we have managed to arrest the decline in post office closures. According to the same Grant Thornton report, 197 post offices closed between 2006 and 2010. Since the end of 2010, only 17 offices have closed. This is a fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> I am pleased that last year An Post was successful in winning the social welfare tender. I also welcome the decision of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to appoint Mr. Christoph Mueller as chairman of An Post. Mr. Mueller's business background is relevant to the business challenges confronting An Post. We look forward to the conclusion of the social policy Cabinet sub-committee in respect of An Post in the 21st century. On behalf of the Government, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is committed to working with the IPU to safeguard and develop the post office network.</p>

          <p eId="para_1185">I strongly commend Deputy Healy on initiating this motion on a crucial issue. I also commend those who have travelled from throughout the country to highlight the critical importance of the post office network in rural and urban areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186"> Last night, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1187">An Post is a commercial State company that earns its own keep and receives no Exchequer subsidy. My colleagues and I cannot arrange a hidden subsidy for it by dictating that all or even any Government business is automatically given to An Post.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">He referenced EU laws that required the services delivered through An Post to be put out to tender. However, a little earlier in his speech he stated: "the post office network has evolved a social role, in the widest meaning of the term, which is highly valued by local communities". There is a significant contradiction between these two parts of the Minister's statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189"> The cold-hearted bureaucrats in Brussels view everything through the logic of capitalism that is red in tooth and claw and do not at all care about the critical social aspects the post office serves in Irish society. Hence, the EU bureaucrats want to pit the small post offices, whether they be in rural areas or working class communities in Dublin, against King Kongs like Tesco and other multiples. What damn does Tesco give about the social role and the poor and the elderly who need to be facilitated by the special knowledge and expertise that those now serving in the post offices provide? Consider how the Tescos of this world short-change the small farmers and suppliers of food, driving down prices to the minimum while soaking shoppers for what they can get and walking away with incredible billions of euro in profit. That is what the logic of capitalism and competition and the EU bureaucrats are holding in store for our post office network if they are allowed to get away with it. If a social role is performed by the post offices, which they clearly do, it should be subsidised. There should be a social subsidy to take into account the unique role that post offices play in our society, both in rural and urban areas, and to recognise the service they deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190"> Of course the Minister will not enter the Chamber with a list of post offices to close. Rather, by allowing the capitalist marketplace to dictate to the benefit of the major multiples, the small post offices will wither on the vine while the large commercial sharks take the business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191"> Government Deputies have come to the Chamber in large numbers, elbowing one another aside to get the chance to speak. I challenge them. If they are serious, why will they not vote for a concrete action that would secure the future of post offices and the crucial services they provide?</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">Why do they not support<b>
						</b>that the Government should instruct each Department to implement, through the post office network, the business identified in the report by Grant Thornton and the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications that will underpin the sustainability of the network? Why will they not vote to commit that all tenders involving over-the-counter transactions will be decided on the basis of both social and economic policy? Why will they not vote to commit to implementing a new banking service that will be available to the post office network and operated by An Post? Why will they not commit to a once off capital investment fund for the further modernisation of the post office, to enable the widespread provision of banking facilities in rural and disadvantaged areas?</p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> If the Government Deputies go along with this cop out from the Minister, they will be rubber-stamping the approach that is being taken to hand the business over to the big multiples such as Tesco, starve the local post office and therefore cause them to close. They should be serious and make up their minds about this.</p>

          <p eId="para_1195">With 1.7 million customers visiting 1,150 outlets every week, An Post is running the largest financial services network in the country. Critically, it is also one of the most trusted institutions in the country at a time when faith in the traditional banking system is at an all-time low. We have all seen the effect the slash and burn closures of Garda stations have had on rural communities. Now our post office network could quite possibly go down the same sorry road. For example, the partnership with Tesco will lead to a more urban-based service which, as has been repeatedly pointed out, threatens the livelihood of hundreds of self-employed postmasters. State services have been farmed out to a multinational supermarket chain. That is what we are practically proposing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196"> I draw attention to the Grant Thornton report, commissioned by the Irish Postmasters' Union. It makes a compelling case for the development of a strategic plan for sustaining the rural post office network. That is the not the first time the Government has heard this. Two years ago, a report by the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on the future of the network indicated that An Post would require additional services to ensure long-term viability, particularly in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> Local post offices have proven time and again that they are willing to adapt to changing times. They can be used for public sector services, such as ordering passports or paying speeding fines. The post offices are willing to do that and are willing to change. State savings at An Post increased from a book of €6 billion in 2007 to almost €17 billion last year. This has happened at a time when people have never been more distrustful of banks. This growth cannot be overstated. Local postmasters hunger for similar new opportunities to develop their businesses. They are not asking for handouts from the State. They are better positioned than any other institution to provide more services to their network of 1.7 million customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> I do not know why the Government approved the creation of 34 driving licence application centres throughout the country instead of awarding the contract to handle the new system to the country's 1,100 post offices. An example of such impracticality can be found in my constituency. In order to get a driving licence in Tramore, if one does not go online, one has to drive 50 km to Dungarvan and 50 km back. That does not make sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199"> An estimated 18% of the Irish population do not have a bank account, for a myriad of reasons, including the fact they cannot afford bank charges. In many cases, they just do not want a bank account and they are entitled to make that choice. We have no right to deprive them of their civil liberties. It is an attack on the civil liberties of 18% of the population to take away the trusting post office service that they have known for generations. I addressed almost 1,000 people outside the Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this evening. I said this was not about stability within the financial services nor about viability of the post offices but about sustainability and viability of the human being. This is not about profit or greed and avarice. Have we not learned over the past ten years that this has been catastrophic on people throughout Ireland? This is about putting people before profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200"> All those people who were outside this building tonight work in post offices and represent many people who are disadvantaged in society. For example, we still have high illiteracy and innumeracy rates in Ireland. It is well known by the Money Advice &amp; Budgeting Service, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other organisations that the post office is the first port of call for many of those people who are under severe psychological pressure. It would be catastrophic to undermine what the post offices do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201"> If the Labour Party Members knew what they were about, I do not think they would do this. I ask them to consider withdrawing the Government amendment. Let us see what happens. The Government should negotiate with the Irish Postmasters' Union and talk to the rest of us. It is not a win situation for the Independent Members if the Labour Party Members withdraw their amendment. We would be very gracious if they did, and we ask them to do it.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_624">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T20:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1202">At the outset, I welcome the postmasters, postmistresses, staff and families who are in the Visitors Gallery tonight, and I thank those who also attended last night. I thank the large numbers who attended a protest outside Leinster House this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203"> The Government amendment and the contributions of the Minister and the Minister of State have been deeply disappointing and even disingenuous. The amendment does not contain a single firm commitment or timeline for any action to protect the post office network. It merely postpones action further by commencing a new review while the post office network is being undermined by the Government. In his contribution last night, the Minister made the cheap headline grabbing statement that the Government has no plan to close post offices. Denying allegations that have not been made is an old cynical media manipulation trick. The real problem is that the Minister and his Government have no plans to keep the post office network open. The effect of the Government and the statements last night and tonight is a clear breach of the commitment in the programme for Government to protect post offices and the post office network. The effect of the amendment is that the actions and even the inaction of the Government will lead to the closure of hundreds of post offices over the short to medium term due to lack of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204"> The Grant Thornton report shows that if the Department of Social Protection contract were lost or a substantial portion of it diverted elsewhere through electronic payments, there would be large-scale closures and job losses. Urgent action, not words, is needed to avoid this development. That is the problem this Private Members' motion seeks to address. The Government amendment fails to address the problem and it should be defeated tonight or withdrawn. Labour Party and Fine Gael Deputies who vote against our motion and in favour of the Government amendment will be held responsible for the closure of post offices into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205"> In his contribution, the Minister sought to give false comfort to the crucial contract with the Department of Social Protection, but the general secretary of the Irish Postmasters' Union said in a statement that immediate Government action is required to ensure the viability of the post office network into the future. He expressed the concern that although An Post had won the welfare payments contract, the Department of Social Protection was actively encouraging customers into using bank accounts to receive welfare payments. He states that while post offices may have won the contract in theory, business is being diverted on a daily basis and post offices will not survive if this continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> The Government must take a number of urgent and concrete actions to protect the post office network and honour the commitment it made in the programme for Government. Foremost among them is the drafting of an action plan. The Government must immediately provide a framework of planning and consultation between An Post, the Irish Postmasters' Union, trade unions in An Post and the Department to draw up a strategic plan to implement the commitment made in the programme for Government to maintain the post office network. The Minister must stop the diversion of business from post offices while this planning is taking place and instruct An Post to cease the roll-out of the installation of machines in Tesco under the guise of a pilot scheme. The Government must stop the Department of Social Protection instructing new jobseekers to open bank accounts into which payments will be made, as occurred recently in Cork. It must grant An Post a full banking licence which can be used by postmasters to avail of Government business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207"> The Minister should have provided these commitments last night and tonight. Instead, we heard waffle and plámas and action being put on the long finger. The post office network is being daily undermined by the Minister and his Government colleagues. I call on all Deputies to support this clear, precise and non-contentious motion and vote against the Government amendment which permits the continued undermining of the post office network. I commend the motion to the House. </p>
