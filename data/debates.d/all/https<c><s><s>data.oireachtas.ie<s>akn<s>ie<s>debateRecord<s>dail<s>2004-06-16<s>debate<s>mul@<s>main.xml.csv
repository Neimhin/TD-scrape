#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	0	There are a lot of backbenchers in again this morning for the Taoiseach.Last Friday the Government was held accountable by the people, who gave their verdict. Every day in the House Opposition Deputies seek to hold Ministers accountable and in that context the parliamentary question is a vital instrument of accountability. Everyone remembers the words of the late Mr. Justice Hamilton, who said that if parliamentary questions had been answered truthfully and completely there might have been no need for a very expensive beef tribunal. I have noticed a trend in the last few years that some Ministers have become quite arrogant about their parliamentary responsibilities and the principle of providing full, complete answers to Dáil questions, a vital democratic instrument for Opposition Deputies.I raise this matter because as head of Government the Taoiseach has a responsibility to ensure that Ministers fulfil their obligations in this regard. I also raise it because yesterday it became quite clear that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform misled the House in replying to a parliamentary question on 3 June and no apology has been offered to the House since. The facts of the case are clear. On 3 June Deputy Jim O'Keeffe asked the Minister if, prior to his appointment as a judge, Mr. Brian Curtin had been appointed as a member of any State agency, State board or committee. The Minister replied that in August 2001 Mr. Curtin, as he was then, had been appointed by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, as a member of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Following a further question from Deputy O'Keeffe, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform admitted yesterday that Mr. Curtin, as he was then, had also been appointed to the Garda Appeals Board panel by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in May 2001. Neither in his reply to yesterday's question nor in a letter he sent to Deputy O'Keeffe did the Minister express any regret for having misled the House on 3 June.I accept the Taoiseach is unlikely to have all the details of the case but I will supply him with the papers. Will he therefore explain to Ministers their responsibilities in giving full and complete answers to Dáil questions and will he ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to apologise to the House for having misled it on an important matter?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1	If Deputy Kenny gives me the papers I will look at the specific case. Obviously if a person is on a State board or State agency then normally that information is given in the parliamentary reply if it is given to the Minister by his Department. That is the normal procedure. If the fact that the person was on the Garda Appeals Board or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal was missed then obviously the Minister would not have given that information and he gave it yesterday. If the Deputy gives me the data I will look at it.Parliamentary replies and the procedure for such replies is a matter of long precedent in the House. Ministers are obliged, both with parliamentary questions and oral questions, to give information. They are supplied by their Departments with supplementary data which they use to the extent necessary in replies. Over the years we have had to deal with parliamentary replies going on for too long and taking up time for supplementary questions. I assure Deputy Kenny that the Government's attitude is that as long as it is a departmental matter, not an agency matter when we tend to say that it is a matter for the agency, we should give full and complete information. That is the process Ministers and Ministers of State follow here every day and there is no change in that. If the Deputy gives me the papers I will check the individual case.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank the Taoiseach for saying he will check these papers. It is perfectly clear that the information had to be dragged out of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I assume a file exists in that Department on the appointment of persons to State boards, committees and panels. When former Deputy Nora Owen was Minister for Justice Deputy O'Donoghue was the Opposition spokesperson and when the fax machine refused to work in the Department it nearly provoked a constitutional crisis.Allegations are being made to me that this information was deliberately concealed by the Minister. I am not making that charge but I would like the Taoiseach to ask the Minister to deal with this matter before the House. He should instruct all his Ministers to give full, thorough and complete information to Deputies insofar as possible when answering parliamentary questions. After all, the Government was held accountable by and received a mid-term verdict from the people last Friday. If it is now to reflect on the consequences of that verdict then it should, in the interests of democracy, give full and complete answers. Will the Taoiseach instruct his Ministers to do that? Will he deal specifically with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when I present him with these papers, which clearly show that the House was misled about appointments made by the previous Minister for Justice involving Mr. Brian Curtin?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	3	As I said I will check the second point, but I note that Deputy Kenny accepts that this was probably an omission. Normally it is something that would be included in a reply and if it were omitted I do not think the Minister was misleading the House in any way. Obviously he replied the second time but I will check it out.For the past seven years, since the start of this Government, it has been our intention to give full information in parliamentary replies. When agencies have responsibility, it is not the Department which is giving information. I know it creates frustration when Members table questions to a Minister and they do not get the information because it is the agency's responsibility. That has long been a procedure of the House where the information is with either commercial or non-commercial State companies. That is something over which we do not have control.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I find that interesting. It may not have been deliberate but, for example, for seven weeks I tried to get information on non-national births in the Dublin maternity hospitals. I finally got a reply this morning dated 11 June. I got pages of details on where babies were born which, for the seven weeks before the referendum, I was told was not in the possession of any agency. I am afraid I am not as forgiving as Deputy Kenny.Will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister for Finance to dip into the crock of gold——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Finance to dip into the crock of gold the Revenue Commissioners found yesterday to fund the aide-mémoire the Minister for Health and Children brought to the Cabinet in which he pointed out that €460 million worth of facilities were lying idle? The Revenue Commissioners discovered €500 million yesterday from their latest off-shore investigation, bringing the total from investigations to €1.52 billion. Major facilities are lying idle, including complete new wings in Mullingar Hospital and in James Connolly Memorial Hospital, a maternity facility in Letterkenny, new wings in Clonmel and Naas Hospitals and radiotherapy units in Galway and Waterford.I notice the massed ranks behind the Taoiseach can scarce forbear to cheer. After last night's meeting and last week and whatever the Progressive Democrats or the Minister for Finance, the Progressive Democrat's cuckoo in the Fianna Fáil nest, say, will the Taoiseach make these resources available to the health services since the Minister for Health and Children said in the aide-mémoire that if this was done, it would have an immediate impact on relieving pressure on services such as acute hospitals, services for older people, mental health services, services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism and adult homelessness? What is the Taoiseach’s response to the Minister for Health and Children’s aide-mémoire?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The Minister for Health and Children's aide-mémoire pointed out that he had spent €1.7 billion on health infrastructure in the past few years.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Given that he has spent €1.7 billion on health infrastructure, there is a number of units throughout the country which he now wishes to open.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Having built these new units, the most modern facilities we have ever had and many of which have been opened and commissioned, the Minister for Health and Children now has €2.7 billion to spend on health infrastructure in the next round from 2004 to 2007.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The Minister will have spent a total of €4.4 billion in his period in office. I note Deputy Rabbitte mentioned some of the units the Minister and this Government have built. I am sure he will be equally supportive when all these units are opened and commissioned.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	14	It seems the Taoiseach has learnt nothing. He must have got an easier ride from the vocal backbenchers last night than I thought. There is no point talking in statistics and in billions of euro when the Taoiseach can get first-hand experience. All he needs to do is talk to all his retired councillors who phoned Joe Duffy to make public confession yesterday. He should ask them about the billions of euro spent.The hard reality is that people cannot get access to a hospital bed when they need one. Accident and emergency departments are grossly overcrowded. For example, there is a splendid new accident and emergency facility in the new wing of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital which has been lying idle for more than a year and cannot be commissioned. Staff there are expected to work in impossible circumstances, yet the Taoiseach cites the figures spent by this Government during the boom years. The fact is that the health services are not working.I pointed out to the Taoiseach that he got €500 million yesterday in taxes evaded which he did not expect from the Minister for Finance, who said the sums uncovered were very small in the context of the level of tax paid each year and that it needed to be put in context. He said it was an insult to the vast majority of taxpayers to say that tax evasion is widespread. Some €1.5 billion in taxes evaded has been recouped to date but the Taoiseach still will not open the facilities lying idle around the country, tackle the clutter in accident and emergency departments or deal with radiotherapy services for Waterford and Galway.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I have already stated that the Minister for Health and Children has a large capital programme. Those units built will be opened and commissioned.

How does he propose to reconcile their demands and his own assertion of opposition to privatisation, specifically in regard to Aer Rianta, with the assertion of the Tánaiste that tough decisions must now be taken, which we all recognise as shorthand for Progressive Democrats decisions that include wholesale privatisation? Does the Taoiseach agree with Deputy McGuinness that the Progressive Democrats would be better referred to as the Oppressive Democrats? Does he agree with Deputy Brendan Smith, my constituency colleague, who said that what is needed is less Progressive Democrats policy? Does he agree with his unsuccessful candidate in the North West constituency, the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, who said prior to the election that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was wired up to the moon? Many in this House certainly agree with him, but I am anxious to know whether the Taoiseach does. Does the Taoiseach accept that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition has run its course, overstayed its time and that we are now looking at the end game?Will the Taoiseach tell us what policy changes in the health area his Government proposes to introduce having come to recognise the reality of people's concern and ire throughout the length and breadth of the State? Will he lead Fianna Fáil into the next general election?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	45	A serious question was asked on health. The Government has brought to a very high level the resources invested in health in the capital programme and in staffing and services. Clearly, there are still difficulties and problems. They have been well put forward by the Minister for Health and Children. It is the Government's intention to continue, as per our programme in Government, to try to complete units under construction, to open those units and to try to plan further improvements, particularly in primary care, acute care, cancer services, services for those with disabilities and mental health care. These are areas in which we have clear policies and where we are fully or partially implementing our programmes. Those are the policy areas in respect of which we are anxious to complete our programmes.

Does the Taoiseach accept that the people have punished him quite severely throughout the jurisdiction because he failed to keep any of his pre-election promises? Is that not the reality and the analysis he must reach in his post-mortem on the results of the local and European elections last Friday?In relation to health, we ask the Taoiseach to read the published report of the public health alliance of Ireland which clearly indicates and exposes once again——

That is the reality and we have highlighted it here to the Taoiseach many times. I ask him again what will he do about it. Will he provide medical card cover most especially for all young people under 18 years of age? It is children who are suffering and parents who are facing the anguish of that choice every day.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	52	It is the Government's intention to continue to provide the needy and the less well off in our society with the best possible services in hospitals, in their communities and in the health services to meet their medical needs. It is a policy we have been pursuing all the time. We have done that successfully in most categories. We have given medical cards to the aged, regardless of their income or circumstances. A large proportion of the population of this State has a medical card. There are some questions around the guidelines on which we continue to try to improve, as we have done. We continue to put resources into the facilities and the services that people need.Regarding the Deputy's other political points, I agree we received some punishment from the electorate last week. However, thankfully, it was in the ballot box and not otherwise. It is always good in a democracy to stick to that means of doing so.In regard to the job in Europe, I think that if I were really interested in that job I would have that job.

While in regard to this Administration, their support is not as critical to the Government's majority, given the support they have provided in the past I have tried and will continue to try to be as helpful as possible to these Deputies.A staff member in my office assists the Government Chief Whip's office in its work in liaising with these Deputies. This official meets with these Deputies on a regular basis and arranges to keep them briefed on issues as they arise.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	62	On what basis are special arrangements made with certain Deputies? Does it include better access to Ministers and to the full range of ministerial offices? If these Members are not members of the Government grouping, on what basis are they accorded special privilege or regarded as most privileged among Members in this House? Will the Taoiseach accept that those who hold ministerial office, be it as a Minister or a Minister of State, have a bounden responsibility to treat all elected Members of this House on the same basis, that the democratic mandate that each and every one of us enjoys in this House requires and deserves an equality of respect from all ministries and that there should not be a kink towards the backbenchers of Government parties or to any other individual Members of this House who align themselves with those parties? Will the Taoiseach accept the equality of the mandate that each and every one of us in this House enjoys?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Of course I would and that is practised very well in this House and always has been. The Deputy will realise that in the case of Government backbenchers or delegations it is easier when one is in Government to get access. I remember when it was the other way around when I was in another position.Regarding courtesies, these arrangements are not as pertinent as they were in the last Dáil. When it comes to people seeking explanations or information, as I said previously, I try to follow the same practice, regardless of what side of the House Members are. This is a daily occurrence. I do not think there is an issue of Members being given special privilege or that there is difference regarding equality of treatment of Members. Such assistance is given to Members purely on the basis of their trying to deal with constitutency issues, deputations and delegations. I do not think that access in that respect is of any great help or assistance otherwise.In the last Dáil we had a direct method of dealing with Members because when Deputies were asked to support the Government, issues had to be explained to them by Ministers so that they knew what they were supporting. That practice is not as frequent in this Dáil, but it was a good arrangement following a precedent that had existed in this House for many decades.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Will the Taoiseach agree that we have a Government with a massive majority that is wasting public money purely to massage a number of Independent Deputies to provide a golden parachute for the Government to ensure that, if it loses the Progressive Democrats' support, it will be able to continue in power? Does he agree that breeds dreadful cynicism among ordinary people about public money being used to help Fianna Fáil cling to power? Will we see an increase in spending in this regard now that the Government's backbenchers are indicating that the PDs are being pushed close to the door?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	65	There is no additional expenditure involved in this regard. A person involved in other work assists wherever possible. Therefore, there is no increase in expenditure involved. It is common courtesy. The reality is that Deputies from all sides of the House at times ask members of the Government to do things to assist them — it is not much more than that.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	66	If we take the Taoiseach at his word about being helpful to individual Members of the House and so on, I ask him to contrast that with the kind of example I gave this morning where on a live current issue, we sought a simple statement of fact about the number of non-national births in the Dublin maternity hospitals. We tabled a parliamentary question——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	68	—— which was passed from one Minister to another and I get a reply dated 11 June 2004, the day of voting.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	69	That does not arise.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	70	With respect, Sir, the——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Deputy, it does not arise out of Questions Nos. 1 and 2.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The question is about the assistance given to Independent Members.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	73	It has nothing to do with questions that were answered in the House. The Chair has ruled on the matter.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Let me put the question this way then. Is it appropriate that the Taoiseach is prepared to put arrangements in place to assist Independent Members and that Opposition parties cannot elicit the same information, even by way of parliamentary question?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Whether a Member is an Independent or a member of a political party and tables a parliamentary question, the same procedures apply. If information was available in a Department, it could not be given to a Member once a parliamentary question on the matter was tabled. That issue could not arise, as it could not be done under the rules.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I have here a letter dated 11 June 2004. It is the ultimate.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	77	That information could not be given to an Independent Member. I do not know the circumstances. The Deputy stated earlier that he tabled the question eight weeks previously and I do not know why it took that length to provide the information. The questions the Deputy tabled were generally in the public domain — the newspapers had been ringing the maternity hospitals and had published their own calculations several weeks ago. I accept that to wait eight weeks for a reply to a parliamentary question is a long time.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	78	We are not talking about the standard procedures that relate to parliamentary questions, where Members abide by Standing Orders of three and five days. In some cases, we receive a response and not an answer. We are talking about a fast track.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Will the Deputy put his question?
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The question is about the fast tracking facility for certain Independent Members of the House. Should this procedure be properly accounted for? Quite rightly, the expenses of Members for travel, accommodation and constituency offices are accounted for every year. Should not the time spent by civil servants specifically accommodating the Independent Members be accounted for also? There are at least half a dozen civil servants in the offices of the Ministers and the Ministers of State of each Department working solely on constituency work and this is not accounted for in terms of public accountability. Does the Taoiseach agree that this should be accounted for?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Questions are tabled time and time again on the cost of the facilities in Ministers' offices and that information is in the public domain.A different arrangement applied during the previous Dáil because Independent Deputies were asked to support the Government in office on a weekly basis. This type of arrangement dates back to the 1950s and applied also in the 1970s, where the Government of the day would explain, brief and assist Independent Members in various ways. This is all quite proper. It is not as necessary or as formal in this Dáil as in the last Dáil, where the Government required the support of four Independent Deputies to enable legislation to be passed. It was a proper parliamentary procedure to brief them and keep them informed.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Is the Taoiseach offering Independent Members an illusion of having the inside track, or is the reality that they get things done that other Deputies cannot? Is that not what this is all about? Essentially, the Government is making sure that it has an insurance policy if Fianna Fáil breaks with the Progressive Democrats.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The formal arrangements that applied during the last Dáil are not in practice now. I do not think it is a question of some Members getting privileged treatment. Independent Deputies do not have the same facilities for seeking deputations and delegations as political parties.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The Independent Members have an additional allowance.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	85	When Independent Members are elected, it may be quite difficult for them, as they point out to me on a regular basis.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Has the Taoiseach outlined the full extent of the assistance available currently or previously to the Independent Deputies, whether the assistance goes beyond advice and information and that the pet projects of Independent Members are being facilitated and fast tracked? Have discussions on such issues taken place in recent times between the Independent Deputies and the office that now facilitates them?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I am not aware of any pet projects. The reality is that Deputies from all parties are always seeking out Ministers to help them with their pet projects. On my way to the House, this morning, a Senator from a non-Government party lobbied me about a pet project. That is quite proper.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	88	That was not the question.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	89	If an Independent Members asks if he or she may meet a Minister to discuss a matter, it does not mean the Minister will accede, but he or she is entitled to gain access to make a case.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	90	That was not my question.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	91	They would get access, but that does not mean they would get the project.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	92	They would be facilitated by preferential access.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	93	It is not preferential access. I see the Opposition Deputies being able to catch the Minister and arrange delegations. It happens all the time.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	94	There is no one to facilitate the pet projects.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	95	It is noticeable that none of the PD Cabinet Ministers is in the House to support the Taoiseach in his post-election travails.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The Minister is in the Seanad.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Is the real purpose of devoting resources to this independent channel to provide the Taoiseach with a spare wheel, in case one of the wheels comes off the wagon? Is that not the real reason he is taking out an insurance policy to protect the Government? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, wakes up every morning with another new earth moving speech that has usually nothing to do with his own portfolio and meanwhile crime levels are rising and so on.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	98	A question please.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	99	Can the Taoiseach continue to have Deputy McDowell making hyperbolic speeches every second day, while the Tánaiste is telling him to speed up and make hard decisions and backbenchers are telling him he must go the opposite direction?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	100	That does not arise out of the questions.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Would it not be much easier to live with a small number of Independent Members from the Fianna Fáil gene pool, who would very soon revert to the family? The Taoiseach would have a cushier life. He has been through a great deal and has served the country well. Would he not consider giving the PDs their P45 now?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	102	He dreams about it every night.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	103	No.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.The National Economic and Social Development Office is funded from subhead M of my Department's Vote. The costs which have accrued to date to my Department in respect of NESDO since its establishment in 2001 amount to €1.276 million. The priorities for NESDO for the coming year are to promote complementary programmes of research, analysis and discussion by the NESC, NESF and NCPP.NESDO will also continue to provide shared administration and support services for those three bodies in order to obtain best possible value for money. It will submit reports, recommendations and conclusions by any or all of the constituent bodies to Government and arrange for their publication.The National Centre for Partnership and Performance has been proactively promoting change and innovation, through partnership, in our workplaces. As borne out by the centre's case studies and review of international experience, partnership works as a positive force for change and it enhances outcomes for both employers and employees. As the ESRI studies commissioned by the centre show, employees want more, not less, partnership.The work currently taking place at the Forum on the Workplace of the Future on how workplaces can adapt to competitive pressures, improve the delivery of services and meet the changing needs of the workplace, will be of particular importance in this regard.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Will the Taoiseach give us a more precise idea of the savings which will accrue as a result of the amalgamations which have led to the formation of the National Economic and Social Development Office? What is the order of staffing in the office and what synergies does the Taoiseach think the amalgamation brings in terms of the contribution he expects it to make? In terms of parliamentary accountability, will the office remain within the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach and will the Taoiseach continue to answer questions on it in the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Yes. The office will still be directly linked to the Department of the Taoiseach. The savings for 2002-2003, which was a costly year, were of the order of 8% and that figure will grow because non-recurring costs were included, such as those for staff moving into their new office in Parnell Square. The expenditure on NESDO is approximately €3.4 million, while that on NESC and NESF is quite small and the costs of NCPP are just in excess of €1 million. NESDO has three staff, NESC has seven, NESF has six and NCPP has eight. There is a slight duplication of staff because the chief executive officer of NESDO is included in figures for two bodies. Therefore, there are 22 or 23 people in the office.In the context of the synergies to which Deputy Rabbitte referred, the primary role of NESDO is to add value to the work of the constituent bodies by creating the conditions under which synergies can be released, joint projects pursued and the potential for duplication — which the offices had identified was inherent in the system — minimised. The office promotes the development of a shared vision for realising these goals and encouraging the constituent bodies to maximise their efforts to collaborate on policy development initiatives and this is working quite well. The bodies will not lose their individual positions. NESC will continue to provide strategic analysis through its reports and will develop the national framework within which discussions on future national agreements and various other issues will take place. NESF will continue to monitor and analyse the implementation of specific measures and programmes identified in the context of social partnerships, especially those to do with issues of equality and social inclusion, and NCPP will continue to focus on bringing about change and improving performance in the workplace through partnership.I am satisfied the terms of reference of the three bodies are complementary and that they can gain a great deal from working in the one building with a joint administration. They will each play their own role when necessary but will also work collectively, which the bodies have proven they do well. Under the umbrella of NCPP, a programme was undertaken last year, including a workplace forum and various conferences and other activities through which the bodies did an enormous amount of work which was totally focused on change and improving performance through partnership in the workplace. The programme was developed from their first meeting in Dublin Castle last year and was brought throughout the country and involved employers, employees, State and private sector companies and people engaged in education and so on. They also produced a cost review study under the umbrella of NCPP.Overall, it was a good gathering of small offices working individually and collectively to do a very good job. The former executive chairperson has set out a very ambitious programme for the next number of years which, if followed, will make this a very successful project.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Almost a year ago, NESF published a report on equality policies for older people. Is the Taoiseach aware it recommended that all Departments and State agencies in the wider public service should prepare and publish equality plans with time-tables for action mechanisms to track these plans and to publish an annual statement on the measures they have either adopted or propose to adopt in order to secure equality on all nine grounds, including age?Is the Taoiseach also aware that NESF recommended that all Departments should undertake equality reviews and that the Equality Authority should devise the template by which the Departments could approach the task? Has this been done and, crucially, has the Department of the Taoiseach taken on a co-ordinating role in ensuring that measures to secure equality for our older citizens, in particular, are undertaken as recommended in the NESF report?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I am aware of the report and its recommendations. The co-ordinating role referred to by the Deputy is the responsibility of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely. I cannot answer for all Departments and agencies but I know many of them have implemented the recommendations, which is a good idea. Like many of the NESF's recommendations, they should be pursued.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I am sure many people in the NESC, NESF and the NCPP will be interested to know the progress of the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill 2002 which is on Committee Stage. Does the Taoiseach have a timeframe in which this Bill will be passed and does he wish to see it passed? When does he see that coming about?Is NESDO part of the Government's decentralisation plans? Given that it has represented the coming together of three bodies, does it not suggest there is sometimes a case for bringing bodies together rather than scattering them to the four corners of the country? In that contect, has the Taoiseach evaluated the thinking behind NESDO?One of the main strands of the NCPP's work, as the Taoiseach mentioned in his reply, is the forum on the workplace of the future. In that context, will he outline the areas being considered to assist employees in adapting to competitive pressures? Does he take the point, made by many employees, that regardless of the fact that they are seen as the most productive in the EU, they are still under immense pressure for increased productivity while issues of child care, paternity leave and so forth are still far behind international standards? Will the Taoiseach indicate what the Government will do to respond to the identification of those problems? Does the increase in commuting time not give rise to a need to re-examine the national spatial strategy in order that the time might be reduced since it is greater here than in other countries?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I would like to see the Bill to which the Deputy referred passed whenever possible. However, it is not affecting the work of the organisations because they were set up and continue to work on a non-statutory basis in the interim, pending the enactment of the Bill.Bringing the three bodies together made sense because they were located in separate offices and places and are small organisations comprising just 22 or 23 staff between them.It made sense to bring them together. The Deputy is correct that it makes sense at times to bring small organisations together because they can share overheads, have better facilities and a better means of working. In this case, that proved to be cost-effective in that there were savings of more than 8% in the start-up year.An enormous effort has been put into the Forum on the Workplace for the Future. For the past 12 months, the forum has been engaged in in-depth discussion, research and analysis on how workplaces operate, and how best they can adapt to competitive pressures and improve the delivery of services. It has also examined in an organised way the difficulties raised by the Deputy and the pressures under which people work to see if there is a way in which workers can be involved in decisions from start to finish. It is clear from the studies that this can be done successfully, especially where employers take account of needs, concerns and flexible time arrangements. Some of these arrangements in agreements are remarkable compared with what would have been the case ten years ago. People have changed their hours and structures to avoid peak traffic times.On the issue of commuting time, I was in Carrick-on-Shannon recently where I met many who had left this city or worked in London and whose greatest pleasure and enjoyment as they left their house at 8.25 a.m. or 8.55 a.m. for their few minutes' drive to work was listening to reports on RTE of traffic congestion. That is a good argument for more of the public and private sector being located outside the city. The length of commuting times is a great shame, as is people having to leave their homes in rural areas permanently to come to cramped and costly accommodation in the city. It is not good for either city or country. It would be much better if we could convince more private sector companies to locate in the regions where there would be many benefits for staff. Some do so because they see the merits of it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Does the Taoiseach agree that the fibre of social partnership has been seriously damaged by the direction of Government tax policy, especially in the past two years? Where was the spirit of partnership in failing to index tax bands and in increasing stealth taxes which ate into the modest wage settlements which people received in the previous pay settlement? Where was the spirit of partnership in finding money for tax breaks for sports clinics when accident and emergency departments are in crisis and unable to cope? Where was the spirit of partnership in finding tax breaks for holiday homes when young couples in Dublin city find it impossible to meet the cost of housing?Is it not time we set about building a new social partnership based on decent values, such as equality of opportunity, instead of the carefully choreographed activity where the Taoiseach, like a white knight, will supposedly rescue the social partnership pay negotiations from the brink of failure? Is it not time we got back to basic values and delivered to people the services they expect?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	112	That was a general question. The Deputy will have seen the recent reports on tax rates in this country and, given our collective and cumulative tax rates, we are now one of the low tax countries of the OECD, not to mention the European Union. The social partnership negotiations are examining the areas referred to by the Deputy such as housing——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	113	Looking and doing are very different.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	114	They are also doing. The figures show a record number of houses being built, with twice the number of a few years ago. The lion's share of them are being bought by first-time buyers and our tax system takes account of that. It would be terrific if we could build houses much more cheaply.Why is it that one can buy a house more cheaply in Florida? I looked at a brochure on property in Florida when I attended the G8 summit last week. I was also given information on what the workers from south Carolina were earning for the job compared with the rates paid in this country. They were working for about a quarter of the rate that Irish construction workers are paid. It is clear from surveys that the price of land is not always the issue. It would be good if prices were lower. The price of a block in this country is the same as it was 12 years ago but the cost of block-laying has increased by 1,900%. These are the difficulties and the issues. That is why other areas do it differently.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	117	The holiday homes scheme was of enormous benefit to communities that have little other than the summer season. It is clear that in parts of Donegal, Connemara and Kerry, local communities live on what they make between now and the first week in September. That is the reality.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Is the Taoiseach aware of the reality that only a third of new homes go to first-time buyers and that a significant report showed that to be the case and that Government housing policy is falling off the spectrum? Is he aware, for example, that a worker in private rented accommodation receives a total of €4 per week from the State to help with rent whereas a person either purchasing or living in a local authority home receives approximately €200 per week? Is that not gross discrimination that ought to be addressed?Where is the sense of urgency from Government in addressing some of these issues? Where is the sense of urgency in sorting out the chaos in accident and emergency departments? Is it not the case that those involved in the social partnership process feel let down and betrayed that there is not a sense of urgency in delivering on the issues that should make partnership work and turn the wealth created into something that makes a difference to people's lives? That is what is missing and the electorate said as much in the past week.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I do not want to start answering questions on health, environment and housing. It is clear from all the recent surveys that the lion's share of new houses went to first-time buyers and the Deputy is, therefore, not correct. In the case of the top 10% of houses, namely, the most expensive, first-time buyers are not in that league.To say that social partnership is not concerned about quality of life issues is not true. Most of Sustaining Progress has been based on improving services and introducing the reforms to allow this to happen. I could give a long answer to the Deputy on a number of issues and the urgency of the reform programmes in many areas. It can be seen that a major difference is being made in many areas that are being targeted. Waiting lists in some categories are almost eliminated and we have seen improvements in cardiac surgery and cancer services, although not in every area. Some regions do not receive equal treatment and people undoubtedly feel aggrieved about that. On the evidence of the cardiac surgery waiting lists of a few years ago, however, it is clear that enormous strides have been made. The same will happen as better facilities are built and opened and the service is improved.We always hear about accident and emergency departments and I accept that they do not work too well, the reason being that people are in hospital for too long because no step-down facility is available. While that creates a problem, it does not take from the fact that the majority of people in hospital receive very good treatment, and we heard as much to this effect during the campaign. About 90% of the problem concerns accident and emergency departments and the fact that people are left lying on trolleys for two, three or four nights. That grates with the public, and rightly so, and is the issue with which we must deal. The reason they are in accident and emergency departments is that they cannot go home. There are no facilities or people to mind them at home so they have to get stand-down facilities. We have to address that issue.

While the Taoiseach earlier acknowledged an awareness of the report and its recommendations, which I welcome, he indicated it was primarily a responsibility for the line Minister. However, my remarks related specifically to the Taoiseach's own Department so I wish to ask again if his Department is now taking on a co-ordinating role, or is it proposed that it should do so, to ensure that measures to secure equality for older citizens are undertaken as recommended by the NESF. What steps, if any, has the Taoiseach's Department taken to implement the recommendations in that Department? That is the specific matter I wish the Taoiseach to address. What he does will provide the lead for other Departments. Has he acted on the NESF report and, if so, will he be specific in outlining to the House exactly what has been done and what remains to be done?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I repeat that I do not have a section, unit or people in my Department to co-ordinate that matter. Therefore, it will not be co-ordinated from my Department, but from the Department that has the section, unit and personnel to make this happen. The section that can do that comes under the aegis of the Minister of State with responsibility for older people. I have neither the resources nor a unit to do it, so it would be meaningless to attach that responsibility to my Department. The best way to do it is through people who are working directly with the services in the relevant unit.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	123	My Department has given over the responsibility for that area and does not have anybody involved in it. Therefore, there is no point in our trying to co-ordinate it because nobody would be doing it.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	127	It is a matter for the House. There are eight minutes remaining and my proposal is to take a question from each of the Members, breaking them into two groups of three questions each, and conclude it. However, it is a matter entirely for the House if it wishes to suspend Taoiseach's Questions. Does the Taoiseach want to proceed?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I will proceed.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 16, inclusive, together.I attended a wreath-laying ceremony on 17 May, which was the 30th anniversary of the bombings, and met many of the victims and their families. I have not received a request to meet with the Justice for the Forgotten group. I have met the group many times and any request for a meeting would, of course, be considered in the context of my diary commitments.I received a copy of the proceedings of the inquests from the coroner the week before last. The inquests lasted over three weeks and I know that the families appreciated the opportunity to relate the deep hurt and sense of abandonment they felt over the years. I also note the apology expressed by the coroner on his own behalf and on behalf of his predecessors, for the delay in completing the inquests in the time since the bombings. I hope that the holding of the inquests has helped the healing process for the families.The House will have the opportunity to debate the report of the Oireachtas committee in the near future before it is considered by the Government.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	130	As the Taoiseach knows, time is passing by and nobody concerned in this matter is getting any younger. The events took place 30 years ago. The Barron report is now being examined by a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The recommendations in that report were very specific and two of them refer to actions by this House, including the commission of investigations legislation. Will the Taoiseach ensure that legislation is expedited so it can be passed by both Houses before the summer recess? In that way, both commissions referred to in the legislation can deal with the reasons the Garda inquiry ended so abruptly, as well as inquiring into the missing documents in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and at Garda headquarters.We must also begin debating the legislation to allow it to be referred to Westminster for endorsement. The Taoiseach should meet with the British Prime Minister regarding the proposal for a public inquiry in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.At the inquest hearings, requests were made for a further investigation into loyalist paramilitary activity relating to the 1974 bombings in Dublin and Monaghan. What action does the Taoiseach propose to take in that regard?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that time is moving on? We had the Barron report in December and some seven weeks or more have elapsed since the Oireachtas sub-committee dealt with the report and the issues involved. However, there is still no indication from the Government as to what actions might be taken. Will the Taoiseach pledge to the House that time will be allocated to debate the report of the sub-committee before the House rises for the summer recess?Has the Taoiseach taken any steps to consult with his colleague, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, in respect of Mr. Royston Brady's claims that he has information that would be relevant in this regard?
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	132	He did not tell us.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Mr. Brady has made a very serious claim and he is standing by it. I would not dismiss it out of hand. I would like to know if the Taoiseach has taken any steps to establish whether or not the claim is well grounded, and whether or not he has asked Mr. Brady to make whatever information he has available in some cogent fashion.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Is the Taoiseach aware that the Northern Ireland Office, the PSNI and, indeed, the forensic science department in the North each refused to attend the recent inquests on the victims of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings? This follows their refusal to attend the Oireachtas sub-committee's hearings. Does the Taoiseach agree with me that this is totally unacceptable? Does he also agree with the Justice for the Forgotten group that it is utterly hypocritical of the British Secretary of State in the Six Counties, Mr. Paul Murphy, to have written in The Irish Times that he is interested in listening to victims’ families, given that he has also refused to appear personally before the Oireachtas sub-committee?Will the Taoiseach use his special relationship with the British Prime Minister to have these matters addressed in the course of seeking to establish the cross-jurisdictional public inquiry that is now required?What action does the Taoiseach propose to take with regard to the failure of his party colleague, and unsuccessful European Parliament candidate, Mr. Royston Brady, to present himself before the Oireachtas sub-committee, given that Mr. Brady has stated he has information relevant to the deliberations of that sub-committee?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	135	As regards the process, it was agreed that we would debate the report in the House before the summer break. The Government will consider the report of the sub-committee and we will then have to deal with the Garda report and the aspects that are special to us. We have already taken up with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Office the other recommendations that were in the report. We have not received a response to those but when the Government formally considers it after the debate here we will renew that effort during the summer.As regards the ongoing investigations into loyalist involvement, as the Deputy knows, a number of other instances are included in Mr. Justice Barron's report into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. These include incidents at Clones and Belturbet, the Pettigoe bombings of 1972, and other bombing incidents that took place before May 1974, as well as the Carr case in November 1971. The report on the murders of Oliver Boyce and Bríd Porter is almost ready and Mr. Justice Barron expects to be able to send it to the Government at the end of this week or early next week. Following Government consideration of the report, it is expected to be referred to the Oireachtas and published.We have taken up the issue of the Loyalists with the NIO which has agreed to investigate three of the four issues on which Mr. Justice Cory reported, apart from the Finucane case. It is not conducting any further investigations on loyalism apart from some of the reports it has already published. It is a pity the individuals from the various sections of Northern Ireland did not attend here. It would at least have been helpful to the families. Even if they did not have a technical or administrative role it would have been good to attend. That is my view but they made their policy decision, which I regret.If the Lord Mayor of Dublin has anything of note to say he should reply to the letter he received from Mr. Justice Barron and give that information. I am not aware of whether he has any information that would be useful.I continue to liaise with Justice for the Forgotten which has made several points about the Oireachtas sub-committee's report. We will follow up those issues in the normal way.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I do not wish to labour the point about the Lord Mayor of Dublin but Mr. Justice Barron wrote to him and the Lord Mayor did not see fit even to reply. It is rather strange that his party leader did nothing to influence the Lord Mayor to co-operate at that stage. The Taoiseach has answered the question on the main concerns of the relatives that the Dáil debate this issue and progress it before the summer recess, which I am glad to hear has happened because I have requested that at Whips' meetings.Will the Taoiseach clarify his position on the view, which is strongly held by many of the relatives, that this matter will not be resolved and concluded without a full public inquiry?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I do not wish to crow over anyone's disappointment but the Taoiseach should make himself aware of what information the Lord Mayor may have so that he can inform the Government process on this. Has he had discussions with the British Government about the possibility of cross-jurisdictional investigation because that is the key to the process? Mr. Justice Barron was impeded in some of his work by inability to get access. Has the Taoiseach made progress on that front?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I wish to get to the nub of this issue. Has the Taoiseach discussed this matter with the Lord Mayor of Dublin who seems to be in possession of very important information? Would it not be in the interests of those who suffered in this atrocity that, as Taoiseach and as a colleague of the Lord Mayor, he would ask him what he actually knows? Has the Taoiseach discussed the matter with him?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The Lord Mayor of Dublin was two years of age when this happened so his memory of any information would not be very good.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	142	If he has information he should answer Mr. Justice Barron's letter. It is a pity the people who have information did not give it over the years. There are people who have very good information but unfortunately we do not have much of that.In reply to Deputy Gregory's question on a full public inquiry, we have agreed a process which will determine whether an inquiry is necessary but we must follow the process. We should have the Dáil debate, the Government should then consider it and decide where we go from there. If we are to have an inquiry it must be in Northern Ireland or in Britain because only there will we get the witnesses to attend. Justice for the Forgotten has accepted that having it here is of no value because we will not get the witnesses from the North or from Britain. That is the issue on which we must focus our minds because having a public inquiry in Dublin on this matter when the people involved and who have the information are outside this State and not answerable to this Government would be a waste of time.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The point is the inquiry must be held where it can get the people to attend. That is the issue. If it is to be held anywhere it must be in London or Belfast. I have pursued all the matters connected with this, in terms of the report of the sub-committee and the good debates here, with the British Government.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	170	The Deputy has made his point. The Taoiseach to respond on the arrangements for taking the Bill.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I wish to make a further point. Second Stage of the Bill was taken yesterday just before 7 p.m. The letter I received was, I presume, written yesterday by the Minister and indicates that all Stages will be taken today. Does the Taoiseach consider that proper process and is the Minister's letter inaccurate or incorrect?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	172	The Government has ordered that Second Stage of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill will resume today. I assume the Minister was seeking agreement to try to conclude the deliberations on the Bill. If such agreement is not forthcoming, we will not pursue the matter.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	183	On a point of order, if the Government has ordered that Second Stage of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill be resumed, surely it is not open to the Minister to decide to take all Stages.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The Taoiseach has already replied on that matter. I must put the question.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 10, motion re Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 agreed to?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	186	No. I strongly object to the methodology proposed to address this matter. The Government is asking the House to vote in favour of a motion to renew the suspension of ordinary rights and freedoms under emergency legislation. The time being provided, 70 minutes, for this is inadequate, particularly in light of the importance of this matter. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has failed to meet his mandatory obligations under section 18 of the legislation to provide a report to the Members of the House on the relevant sections of the Act and in respect of its performance during the past 12 months. This report was withheld until yesterday afternoon. I warrant that few Members have had the opportunity to read it. If any have been able to do so, they can only agree that it provides no evidence that the emergency provisions laid out in the 1939 to 1998 sequence of Offences against the State Acts are necessary or that ordinary law would not have proved sufficient to secure sound convictions.

The Government has not met the section 18 requirement. Accordingly, I propose that the debate——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	189	We are discussing the proposal regarding the time allocated. What the Deputy might say on the motion itself is not appropriate at this stage.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The time allocated is inadequate. In addition, there has been a failure by the Minister and the Government to provide the necessary detail until the last moment. The Minister's report contains nothing that properly argues for the continuation in operation of certain provisions of these odious Acts. I, therefore record my strong opposition because the Minister has failed to present any cogent case for their continuation.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Will the Deputies claiming a division please rise?Deputies Crowe, Joe Higgins, Finian McGrath, Morgan, Ó Caoláin and Ó Snodaigh rose.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	192	As fewer than ten Members have risen I declare the question carried. In accordance with Standing Order 68 the names of the Deputies dissenting will be recorded in the Journal of the Proceedings of the Dáil.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I wish to raise two issues from the legislative programme that bear on the respect of Government for the House, as well as its legislative proposals. The first is in regard to the State airports Bill. Is it the case that the Cabinet has approved it but has withheld its publication pending the Fianna Fáil meeting? Will it be accompanied by a business plan for the airports, which will be separated by the Bill.I read yesterday that an Oireachtas committee reported on the abuse of alcohol by young people and made recommendations to the House. The Department of Health and Children has indicated it will not act on the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee. What arrangements will the Taoiseach make to ensure the Department of Health and Children listens to the views of the Oireachtas committee before it decides on its legislative programme?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	194	The Deputy has made his point.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Surely there is an obligation on the Department of Health and Children to listen to an Oireachtas committee that makes recommendations and not just to proceed regardless with its legislative proposals?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The State airports Bill is due this session. Regarding the other matter, I understand the report was cleared yesterday by an Oireachtas committee.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	197	It is also on the Government's legislative programme. The indication is that the Government is proceeding with its own Bill, irrespective of the fact that an all-party Oireachtas committee has recommended a different approach.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The heads of that Bill have been approved. I am sure the views of the Oireachtas will be taken into account.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18721	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	199	That is not clear from the press office of the Department of Health and Children.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I wish to raise two matters. When will the Bill to facilitate the transfer of the Dublin Institute of Technology to Grangegorman be published? Is it the Government's intention to enact it this session?The Taoiseach has instanced the burden of European business and the fact that the House will have risen as his reasons for not going ahead with the Cabinet reshuffle. This party is prepared to come back until the end of July to facilitate half a dozen Ministers or more who are clapped-out being put out to grass. I am sure my colleagues in the House would come back for that purpose. Deputy Conor Lenihan said on another occasion——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	209	The Grangegorman development Bill will be published today. On the other matter, having only gone up 1% after seven years in Opposition Fine Gael would reshuffle its people. However, because everyone in Fine Gael has a job in the party the positions cannot really be reshuffled.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	210	The NCCP's Forum on the Workplace for the Future, which we discussed earlier, does not extend, as far as I know, to the Cabinet. However, it points out that employees around the country need legislation such as the safety, health and welfare at work Bill, given they are being asked to be even more productive, notwithstanding the enormous pressures on them at the moment such as lack of child care, commuting, etc. Does the Taoiseach intend to prioritise that legislation, given that yesterday he told us that matters coming up before the summer recess of 2004 have been put back to next term. Will this legislation come before the House before the summer?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Yes, this Bill has been cleared by Cabinet. Some matters remain to be cleared up but it will be published shortly.

As the two Bills are related, will he publish both together by the end of autumn rather than allow another year's delay?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I will bring that matter to the attention of the Minister.

The health reform legislation is promised for the end of the year. The Health (Amendment) Bill has abolished health boards and there is a lacuna in terms of democratic accountability. Members of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children were given an undertaking by the chair of the health service executive and the Minister of State that we would be given documentation — the composite plan for the health services. The promise was made but we have still not received the documentation.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I move:That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998), shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30th June, 2004.The resolution before the House seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June 2004.In commencing the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is worth recalling the circumstances in which the 1998 Act was enacted. In August 1998, the Omagh bomb brutally snuffed out the lives of 29 innocent people and injured more than 200 others. That terrible atrocity has reverberated throughout the island of Ireland ever since, and rightly so.There was a determination then, as now, that those responsible for that mass murder would not succeed in subverting the democratically expressed will of the people that the Northern conflict should be resolved only by peaceful means and on the basis of consent. To date, one person has been convicted in this jurisdiction on a charge related to the Omagh bomb and another person has recently been charged in Northern Ireland.On both sides of the Border, the investigation is continuing with excellent co-operation between the Garda authorities and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. It has been stated before but is worth reiterating that the Garda Síochána will never cease in the search for those responsible.It will also be recalled that in recognition of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the provisions of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that it should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas. The purpose of this recurring Oireachtas scrutiny is to determine if the circumstances prevailing in 1998 justify the continuance in force of the Act's provisions or whether there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to convince the Oireachtas that the provisions are no longer needed.Accordingly, under section 18 of the Act as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 and by virtue of resolutions passed most recently by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 and 26 June 2003, sections 2 to 12, inclusive, and 14 and 17, will cease to operate on and from 30 June 2004 unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for a period not exceeding 12 months.In addition, there is a requirement in the 1998 Act for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to lay a report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas prior to any consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. Such a report was laid before this House yesterday.The conclusion of that report, which is also the view of the Garda authorities, is that the renewal of the provisions for a further year is necessary. The regrettable reality is that those responsible for the Omagh bomb continue to pursue and plan a campaign of violence and there is no substantive change in the circumstances which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act. In this regard, the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA continue their calculated repudiation of the democratically expressed wishes of the people of Ireland, North and South, for peace in the form of the Good Friday Agreement. These paramilitary groups arrogate to themselves the right to kill and maim in the name of a people and a nation who have repeatedly rejected their path of violence.Let us not forget that these groups seek to plan and execute terrorist attacks, small and large. The House may recall that in June last year, two enormous improvised explosive devices were intercepted, one by the Garda Síochána in County Louth and the other by the PSNI in Derry. Both had the potential to be two more Omagh bombings and it was only by dint of excellent police work that further tragedy on a massive scale was averted.Before turning to the individual sections of the Act, I will outline the current position on the report of the committee to review the Offences Against the State Acts 1939 to 1998, which was published in August 2002. The report is extensive and deals with complex issues of law and policy. It involves important considerations concerning the balance to be struck between national and international security on the one hand and civil liberties and individual rights on the other. Those recommendations in the report of direct relevance to the purpose and scope of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 were considered in the context of the preparation of that legislation. The Bill, which awaits Committee Stage, will accordingly give effect to a limited number of recommendations to that end. A fuller consideration of the recommendations of the committee will be finalised once this Bill has been enacted, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will then bring further proposals to the Government.I will deal with the sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which the House is being asked to continue in force for a further 12 months. I will briefly outline their purpose and indicate to the House how they have been utilised in the past 12 months. Dealing with those sections of the 1998 Act that were utilised since the end of the last reporting period, from 1 June 2003 to 31 May 2004, the following is the case.Section 2 was utilised on 29 occasions, with one person charged and convicted in the reporting period. In addition, six persons were convicted during the period under report, having been charged prior to that period in cases where this section was utilised. By way of explanation, section 2 provides that where, in any proceedings against a person for membership of an unlawful organisation, evidence is given that the accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.Section 5 was utilised on 16 occasions. By way of explanation, the section provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences Against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years' imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his defence that he could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. As with section 2, however, a person carrot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.Section 7 was utilised on 12 occasions. This section makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.Section 9 was utilised on 30 occasions. This section makes it an offence to withhold information which a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.Section 10 was utilised on one occasion. This section extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court. In this regard, the judge must be satisfied, on the application of a Garda officer not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make or to have made submissions on his or her behalf. In the reporting period in question, while no charges resulted in the granting of the one extension order, a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.Section 11 was utilised on four occasions. This section allows a judge of the District Count to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances where the judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence.Section 14 was utilised on 76 occasions. The effect of this section was to make the new offences created under sections 6 to 9, inclusive, and 12 of the 1998 Act, scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing these offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act.I will now deal with those sections of the 1998 Act that were not utilised in the period under report, namely, sections 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 17. Section 3 of the Act provides that in proceedings for an offence of membership of an unlawful organisation the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his behalf, unless the court permits otherwise. Section 4 amends section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1972. The effect of the 1972 provision is that any statement or conduct by a person accused of membership of an unlawful organisation implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was a member of such an organisation shall be evidence that he was then such a member. It originally defined the expression 'conduct' as including an omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation. The change made by section 4 of the 1998 Act is to expand the definition of 'conduct' to include 'movements, actions, activities or associations'. This simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions. activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.Section 6 establishes the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act 1939. Although this section was not utilised in terns of criminal charging during the period under report, one senior member of a dissident republican group was found guilty of this offence last August and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment, to run concurrently with a sentence of six years' imprisonment for the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation. This constituted the first time any person was found guilty of the new offence of directing an unlawful organisation and represents a significant victory for the maintenance of the rule of law in this jurisdiction.Section 8 makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. Although this section was not used in the reporting period, one person arrested for membership of an unlawful organisation was subsequently charged with receiving training in the use of firearms. Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994, providing for the forfeiture of property.Much has been achieved in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and although the current pace of progress leaves much to be desired, it is, as is said, the only show in town. As I have already mentioned, however, there are those who would do everything in their power to subvert the peace process through violence. One need only examine the recently published first report of the Independent Monitoring Commission to see just how much of a threat these dissident republican groups pose.In the IMC report the Real IRA is described as having access to a significant quantity of arms and equipment and as being potentially a very dangerous terrorist group. Since the Omagh bombing, attacks attributed to the Real IRA include the bombing of Shackleton barracks in February 2000, a sporadic but high profile campaign in Great Britain, including a rocket propelled grenade attack on the Security Intelligence Service headquarters. There have also been some recent attacks on the British military, as well as against people involved in the Policing Board and district policing partnerships.The IMC report goes on to state that the primary focus of Real IRA attacks remains on security force bases and personnel in Northern Ireland and those involved in the new policing arrangements but that a wide range of targets cannot be ruled out, including targets in Britain.The IMC characterises the Continuity IRA in a similar vein. Although it is described as a limited organisation with a relatively small membership, the IMC considers that it can, by operating through small units, mount effective, if sporadic, attacks.The IMC's pen pictures of these two dissident republican groups paint a frightening portrait of individuals and organisations to whom violence is the be all and end all of matters. The Garda authorities view is that the current terrorist threat, in the form of both the Real IRA and Continuity IRA, demands that the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act be extended for a further 12 months. As I have described, the provisions of this Act are regularly used in the ongoing fight against crime. The 1998 Act is part of the legitimate democratic response to that very real threat and I ask the House to continue in force the relevant provisions of the Act for a further 12 months. I commend the resolution to the House.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The question to be addressed is whether there is need in the Ireland of today to continue the relevant sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. A number of issues must be examined in deciding that resolution. The first, as mentioned by the Minister of State, is the horrendous crime of the Omagh bombing. It is appropriate that we remember the 29 innocent people who died and more than 200 innocent people who were injured, some very seriously, in that attack. We must also remember the murderous people who perpetrated that dreadful crime and are, unfortunately, still around. With only one of them convicted, there are still those who await the scales of justice to be weighed against them. That is one reason we should continue with these provisions.The second reason is that we must take into account the views of the Garda authorities who make clear that republican groups currently pose a security threat. They also refer to international terrorist groups, members of some of which are people in this country, in particular this city.We must open our eyes to what is around us. There are armed, illegal groups, unlawful organisations, which are still prepared to take it on themselves to impose their perverted view of Ireland by killing and maiming people on this island. The fact that they wave and shelter under our flag makes this even worse. The difficulty is we are confronted by people who are anti-democratic, neo-fascist and not answerable to the normal processes of the law. In such circumstances, we must continue these measures under the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. For this reason, I fully endorse and support the resolution before the House.In doing so, it does no harm to examine from where the threats come and whether all parties are dealing properly with them. Dissident republican groups are increasingly referred to nowadays, which tends to ignore the continuing activity of the Provisional IRA. They have not gone away. It is clear from the report of the Independent Monitoring Commission that the Provisional IRA continues to exist and to engage in paramilitary and criminal activity. It is important we realise this and that people are prepared to shed a tear for and have released from prison the killers of Garda Jerry McCabe. They were operating under the shelter of our flag, the tricolour, when they engaged in criminal activity, stealing money, in the course of which they brutally gunned down a member of the Garda Síochána.The dissident groups, the Real IRA and Continuity IRA, must also be examined. They are still prepared to murder and maim for their own illegal purposes. They have access to weaponry and are prepared to consider making such weaponry available to other criminal gangs, having done so in Limerick city.How criminal elements masquerading under names that were once looked up to in the State should be confronted is another matter. All of them must be utterly and completely isolated and condemned and all right-thinking people must be unequivocal on that issue. This also raises the link between the IRA and Sinn Féin. It is more important that this should be examined in light of the number of seats gained by Sinn Féin in the recent elections. The party gained seats on a number of local authorities and one seat in the European Parliament.

I will refer to Northern Ireland separately. The continued link between the IRA and Sinn Féin is relevant. The democratic credentials of Sinn Féin must be put under the microscope to a greater extent because of the recent election results. The party must answer why it has adopted certain stances, especially in regard to the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, whether it is fully supportive of the State's institutions and the Good Friday Agreement, and, in particular, whether it supports the policing arrangements in Northern Ireland. Unless those answers are forthcoming, the party will not pass the democratic test. Those answers are necessary and they should be given now.While we are debating a motion relating to the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, there is a need for a much broader, more considered debate to assess fully where we stand on the terrorist threat in the State. The report provided by the Minister of State outlines bare statistics regarding the number of people who have been dealt with under various sections on the Act. For example, section 2 was utilised on 29 occasions, section 9, which deals with withholding information, was utilised on 30 occasions, while section 14 was utilised on 76 occasions. However, behind those statistics lie people who are still prepared to subvert the institutions of this State. That can range from the killing of Detective Garda McCabe to the provision of safe houses or support for murderous gangsters to political support. This issue needs to be addressed fully.I encourage everybody with a patriotic drop of blood in them to ostracise those who are involved in such illegal, fascist activity on both sides of the Border. I encourage everybody who wants an end to such activity to utterly condemn it initially. They should then be prepared to withdraw all support for those engaged in such activity and who refuse to condemn it, and they should co-operate with the institutions of the State to ensure it is ended.Liam O'Flaherty wrote a book entitled The Informer which made an impression on me when I was young. It dealt with a time when the circumstances of our county were much different. Ireland is a democratic state and the Good Friday Agreement relating to Northern Ireland has been endorsed by the people on both sides of the Border. This raises the question of the current status of an informer. The wheel has turned full circle. Those who are not prepared to divulge information in their possession are accomplices to the subversion of the State and to the acts committed by those who are still prepared to murder and maim. The word “informer” needs to be redefined. Those who accept the responsibility of citizenship, support the State and are genuinely democratic will accept it as part of their responsibility to provide information to the authorities on the island to ensure illegal activities are ended and those involved in such activities are put behind bars. I fully support the motion.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	268	We are debating the renewal of various sections of the 1998 Act. Thankfully, a caveat was inserted when the legislation was going through the Oireachtas that an annual report should be made to the Houses before its provisions were renewed. This legislation was passed subsequent to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement when it was hoped that peace had been reached at last and violence had been brought to an end following the overwhelming response to its proposals. Then there was the disaster of the Omagh bombing, however, and amending legislation was passed. There was a concern that, unlike previous emergency legislation in this area, it would only be temporary.Earlier today we discussed the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which did not result in immediate legislation though those were even greater atrocities at the time. We must seriously consider whether we should continue with draconian emergency legislation such as this. That was recognised in the Good Friday Agreement and for that purpose a review mechanism was put in place to ensure the offences against the State legislation would be examined to see if it was in accordance with fundamental civil liberties and individual rights, particularly in the context of political developments. The Hederman report was produced in 2002 but it has been sitting on the shelf since.I want to put down a marker. The Labour Party will expect action to be taken on the recommendations of that review of the Offences Against the State Act before the next renewal date for the legislation. It is about time the Government addressed the review, because it deals with important issues of civil liberties and the entitlements of those in a democratic State. Those have not been teased out and we have not even had a debate on the review in the House. That should be a priority and I expect that action will be taken on that report or the next renewal will be very problematic.The first question is whether renewal is justified, but the Minister made it very difficult for us to answer that question. He waited until yesterday to place in the Dáil Library the annual report he is bound to produce under section 18, without telling us it was there. We are expected to provide proper analysis and consideration of that report in this debate and that is not good enough. The Minister had the report for three to four weeks and it could have been available in the Dáil Library during that period. It should have been brought to the attention of the House but that was not done. We are conducting this debate in a vacuum without adequate information before us. In future the Minister should ensure there is an adequate period in which to present this material to us.Civil liberty is a major issue in any democracy. During the peace process Britain repealed its prevention of terrorism legislation after 20 years and it did so without replacing it with more draconian legislation. The Human Rights Commission of Ireland operates on a statutory basis and is tasked with ensuring that human rights in Northern Ireland and the Republic are kept to an equivalent level and are promoted and protected. As I said, with the Good Friday Agreement there was movement towards dismantling the emergency legislation by establishing the review committee and we also have the International Monitoring Commission, which looks at the level of paramilitary activity on the island. We have reports from the Garda as well.Under the legislation there has been one conviction in this jurisdiction of a person on a charge related to the Omagh bomb, while another person has been charged in Northern Ireland. That is not what one would regard as major or successful use of the legislation and it is a bare statistic which merits some analysis and commentary from the Garda and the Minister. Does legislation have much validity if it is not implemented successfully or is not working effectively?Page 8 of this report states that key provisions of the Act are continuing to be used to good and proper effect, and one of the most significant results in the Garda fight against subversive activity was the conviction of a person on a charge of conspiracy to cause an explosion in relation to the Omagh bomb. The report goes on to state that the provisions were used appropriately by the Garda Síochána and will continue to be used in their efforts. The report also states that the relatively modest number of occasions on which the provisions of the Act have been used by the Garda demonstrates that those provisions have been applied in a reasonable and proportionate manner.That is open to a totally different interpretation, that that relatively modest number means the legislation may not be justified at this point. However, we do not have sufficient information with which to carry out a proper, sober analysis of whether that is the case. Before this legislation comes before the House next year the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should attend a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and explain why legislation brought into being in 1998 is still in existence even though the Houses of the Oireachtas clearly intended it would be phased out as rapidly as possible. That was why the report and renewal mechanisms were included.The commissioner and the Minister should make their arguments for the necessity of renewing the legislation rather than simply asserting that it should be renewed. They should be cross-examined by members of the committee on the issue. That is the responsible way to approach this. We should have an early report and give time to Members to study it, then we should bring in the commissioner and-or the Minister to look into the matter properly. We can then make a fair and reasoned decision on whether the legislation should be renewed.The International Monitoring Committee referred extensively to loyalist paramilitary activity, suggesting that special legislation should be introduced to deal with it. One could argue that the British Government should consider doing so, given the extent of such activity in the North. The IMC report states that the primary focus of Real IRA attack remains on security force bases and personnel in Northern Ireland and on those involved in the new policing arrangements, but that a wide range of targets cannot be ruled out, including targets in Britain. There is no evidence of any of the activities referred to in the Republic and I would like to see reference to that.The remit of this legislation only extends to the Republic. Perhaps future reports will expand on why reference to another jurisdiction is, in the same way, relevant to this one. That seems to be the connection being made.The legislation changes the rules of evidence, creates new offences, particularly in regard to membership of illegal organisations, and extends periods of detention. The report refers to sections of the legislation which were used, including for possession, withholding information, re-arrest and training in the use of firearms. Nearly all these sections are covered by other legislation. The real intention of the legislation, which was to get convictions in regard to the Omagh bombing, has been spectacularly unsuccessful. Section 5, relating to inferences that may be drawn, was used 16 times. Section 7, relating to possession, was used 12 times and section 9, relating to withholding information, was used 30 times. Those sections are already covered by existing legislation, so this is not an argument to renew this legislation.The only real argument for renewal of this legislation is how successful it has been in bringing the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing to justice because it is directed specifically at them, namely, the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA. It is not directed at the Provisional IRA which is covered in the Offences Against the State Act. There is no sense putting a plethora of legislation on the Statute Book unless it is effective and desirable.My other concern is that we are getting caught up in this ad hoc response to terrorism because there is now an international dimension. Almost all our justice legislation is being coloured by this global fear of terrorism. Emergency provisions are constantly creeping into our legislation. It is high time we undertook an overview of the criminal legislation we are bringing in, including what is already in place such as the Offences Against the State Act, and of the provisions in regard to terrorism-type offences to see where we stand as a democracy and whether it would be better to have a wider framework in terms of our domestic needs without responding to fears and concerns internationally and adopting knee-jerk reactions in respect of having sufficient emergency legislation on the Statute Book in the event of the apocalypse because that is really what the Offences Against the State Act is all about.I put down a marker that we expect something more substantial from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the next occasion and that there will be serious questions to answer if that is not forthcoming.

As in a recent debate on the citizenship referendum, the Minister or a Minister of State from the Department has not bothered to attend to argue why we should continue to remove civil liberties.

It was scheduled for today even though the Ministers are missing. The Taoiseach could have taken the debate.This is supposed to be legislation dealing with an emergency. There is no emergency and that can be seen from this ridiculous report which arrived yesterday at 4 p.m. It is word for word the same as the report produced last year other than the page numbers have changed and a few different figures have been thrown in. There has been no analysis of the effectiveness of this legislation. When this legislation was put through this House, the reason for the report mechanism was to see whether it was effective. One person has been charged under this legislation and different sections were used on 30 occasions and on 12 occasions respectively. That is a trawling exercise to arrest people. No charges have been brought against all the people listed which is exactly what it was not meant to do.Emergency legislation is for an emergency and is of its nature a temporary measure. The Offences Against the State Act has never been a temporary measure and it has been continuously used and abused by the Garda. In fact, it has led to the special branch being what it is today, namely, a political police force. Section 18 of the 1998 Act requires the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to produce a report which would be the basis on which we would renew the legislation annually. Last year I, and others in this House, stated that there was a need for a proper debate and a proper report and for an analysis. As Deputy Costello said, there is a need for a committee to consider this not just as we approach the deadline, but on an ongoing basis in the context of the Good Friday Agreement. A provision of the Good Friday Agreement was that we would dispense with repressive emergency legislation as circumstances permitted. Circumstances permit for dispensing of sections 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 17 which have not been used. That alone is sufficient grounds for the Minister to dispense with those sections. We should continue to row back all this emergency legislation as the parties to the Good Friday Agreement accepted we should. I, as has my party, have continuously opposed emergency legislation because it does not lead to the required result. In fact, it perpetuates a cycle of repression and it has not shown that it can work.It is high time the Government took seriously its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement in regard to repressive legislation in this State and started as circumstances allow, to dispense with these sections. This pathetic little report has shown that this legislation is not working, cannot work and is not even being used but rather is being abused because people are not being charged under it. All the questions Deputy Jim O'Keeffe asked earlier have been regularly answered. If he wishes to have a debate, we can have one on another occasion.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	274	The Omagh bombing was a monstrous atrocity carried out by a tiny paramilitary organisation with no mandate from anybody. That is not to say that if it was a much larger paramilitary organisation, the atrocity would be in some way less despicable. The bombing campaign carried out by the Provisional IRA over some decades was also despicable and reactionary. Paramilitarism in Ireland, whether republican or loyalist, has always objectively played a reactionary role.Socialists always pointed out that republican paramilitaries could never defeat British imperialism, that on the contrary their activities resulted in the division of working class communities to a level of polarisation that is still evident to this day, and that only the unity of the working class in Northern Ireland, and North and South, could lay the basis for the permanent resolution of the national question and the social and economic issues that bedevil significant sections of the working class in Northern Ireland with resonances in the South as well.The response of this capitalist State has been to use paramilitary atrocities to enact repressive legislation of a wide-ranging character. This legislation goes way beyond any specific act of terror and provides the State with contingency legislation which it will use if it feels it needs it to protect the establishment. For example, section 18 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 states that any organisation that promotes, encourages or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the Central Fund or any other public fund or the non-payment of local taxation shall be an unlawful organisation within the meaning of the Act. The mass movement against the water charges in the 1990s or an equivalent movement, such as the anti-poll tax movement in Britain, could therefore be declared to be an unlawful movement in this State and could be repressed in exactly the same terms as the paramilitary organisations which were used as an excuse to introduce this type of legislation.The provisions of the 1998 amendment to the Offences against the State Act are draconian in the extreme. It potentially criminalises a wide range of innocent activities, turns on its head the belief that one is innocent until proven guilty and attacks a range of basic civil rights. It expresses the monstrous hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in enacting this repressive legislation in response to an atrocity that monstrously destroyed dozens of innocent lives while, over the past 12 months, helping on their way bombers from the United States Air Force which have slaughtered thousands of innocent people in Iraq.Why should we trust the Government with wide-ranging repressive powers? Why should we trust the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in particular, with draconian powers? He was part of a Government which orchestrated a massive, repressive apparatus of policing around May Day to suppress legitimate and peaceful civil protest. He allowed senior gardaí to orchestrate a sham excuse for trying out their riot control techniques when clearly there was no riot, and allowed them to unjustifiably use water cannon for the first time in the history of this State. He orchestrated the clearing of a wing of Wheatfield Prison and the imprisonment there of young people for the most minor of alleged offences while taking no such action against sections of the establishment guilty of defrauding the taxation system of billions of euro. No such action was taken against senior bankers who organised fraudulent rackets of a most wide-ranging nature.Repressive legislation brought in under one guise is a threat to peaceful civil movements, the ranks of the trade union movement and working class people seeking to organise themselves. For that reason, I oppose the motion.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I, too, regret that neither the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform nor a representative of his Department is present. I particularly wanted to hear the Minister respond to the effect of his role as election agent for political parties other than his own through his recent utterances and policy positions. I would have liked the opportunity to challenge him on that as it seems to have had the opposite effect to what he attempted to do publicly.This is not a debate about legislation that takes off the Statute Book the proper illegality of being a member of a paramilitary organisation that undermines the institutions of the State. That already exists in law. Neither is it about taking off the Statute Book the illegality of using arms and explosives to kill and maim citizens of this State. That also already exists on the Statute Book. We are not debating the removal from the Statute Book the seditionary means such organisations and people involved in them use to undermine the institutions of this State. We are debating the opportunity presented, through the continuance of emergency legislation, for the prosecuting authorities to use means that would not be acceptable in normal principles of natural law and how evidence is acquired and presented in a court case.There are times when the State is threatened. I would have thought that a report of this nature would have underlined the essence of that threat. How many people are involved? Is it 40 or 400? The fear is that because security, after patriotism, is the second last refuge of the scoundrel, there will never be a time when emergency legislation will not be promoted by the likes of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We see how the security scare is being used on a regular basis in the United States with the concept of homeland security. If we live in a democracy, there must be a time when emergency legislation should not be on the Statute Book. That case has not been made here today.The report shows that half the sections of the Act passed in 1998 were not used last year. Why are there no proposals to delete those sections of the Act that seem to have no further use? There were 169 uses of the other sections of the Act. We do not know the number of people to whom such uses apply nor the number of those charged or dealt with under various sections of the Act. We are informed that 14 convictions for terrorist activities and 30 pending prosecutions exist. We do not know to what extent the Offences against the State Act was primarily or even partially responsible for securing those convictions. The Government and those who authored this report have failed to state how that case can be made.What is lacking from this report is that with regard to the 169 uses of the emergency legislation, we do not know the number of citizens who were affected by guilt by association, that is, people who did not commit any crime or did not have any intent to do so. Where emergency legislation exists, there are victims. As Members of this House, we should be informed of the number of such people and what the State intends to do to redress the victimisation they have suffered. People, including the Minister, might say that is a price worth paying. However, it is to be hoped we are entering a period of peace on this island. It does not exist yet and, at best, we are seeing the non-exercise of lethal violence, but non-lethal violence continues to permeate throughout our society. Even the explicit references that extra policing activities can be taken by those involved in parliamentary groups is unacceptable and there is a need for legislation to reflect that.What the Government, the Minister and this report have failed to do is show the essence of the threat that exists, why there is a need for the continuation of this emergency legislation and the reason the Act passed in 1998 has failed to address the continuing needs of the victims and relatives of victims of the Omagh bombing to get justice for themselves and their families. Other than honouring some sort of feel-good attitude that the Minister wants to portray about being some type of judicial superman, the onus is on the Government to bring about results and not leave on the Statute Book legislation that is not working and is not in the interests of citizens.

I will bring the various issues raised to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

It was simply not possible to order the Business of this House in line with his very busy schedule.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I wish to respond briefly to some of the issues that have been raised. Deputy Costello referred to the report of the committee to review the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998. As I stated in my speech, that report, which was published in August 2002, is an extensive one dealing with complex issues of policy and law. Certain recommendations in the report, which were of direct relevance to the purpose and scope of the Criminal Justice (Terrorism Offences) Bill 2002, were considered in the context of the preparation of that legislation. Accordingly, the Bill, as published, contains provisions designed to give effect to a limited number of recommendations to that end.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently examining the remainder of the report and a comprehensive response will issue in due course. It is not considered appropriate to pronounce separate judgments on any of the committee's other recommendations in the meantime.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to the Provisional IRA in the context of the Good Friday Agreement. Deputies will be aware that the institutions remain in a state of suspension, which has been the case for some time now. Since spring, both Governments have been conducting a review of the agreement in close consultation with the political parties in Northern Ireland. It must be acknowledged that progress has been slower than expected. The recent European Parliament elections interrupted the review process itself. Nevertheless, both Governments are anxious to make headway on the review with the ultimate goal of promoting the full implementation of the agreement.This legislation essentially deals with the results of the Omagh bombing and the continuing threat of the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA. While I have much respect for many of the things for which Deputy Joe Higgins stands, it is not fair to relate the purpose of this Bill to the other activities to which he referred, particularly the reasonable efforts of the Garda Síochána to deal with what was a significant threat to public order in this city during the most recent May Day celebrations. We all stand for the right to protest peacefully, but it was clear to the Garda authorities that public order could be seriously disrupted on that occasion. The House must give the Garda Síochána the support to ensure that that kind of threat to public order does not develop into violence, as has occurred in other cities throughout Europe.I listened to the contribution of the Sinn Féin representative but there can be no ambivalence about the need for a continuation of this legislation. We either support it or we do not. It is vitally important to keep the legislation in place. We must continue to try to bring to justice the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing. There is no middle ground.

The Chief of Staff arranged for the submission to be examined by a board of military officers. I have been informed by the Chief of Staff that he has recently received a report from the board of officers. Having examined the report, he has requested clarification on a number of matters. This clarification, which involves research of archival material, has been requested by 1 July 2004. Pending the outcome of the examination, it would not be appropriate for me to comment. I will carefully consider any recommendations that the Chief of Staff may make on the issue.

At that time the Minister gave an undertaking that there would be no undue delay and that it would be processed as soon as possible. Has the board of military officers charged with this matter interviewed or contacted any of the survivors who participated in the event at Jadotville 43 years ago or has any of them made submissions? The last time the Minister replied that a former serving officer in the Congo at the time made a submission? Has anybody else made a submission and, if so, has it been considered? If submissions were to be made would they be considered by the board?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	284	As I indicated to Deputy McGinley on the last occasion, I was anxious that this matter proceed as expeditiously as possible. That has happened and the board has been established. It would not be the practice for a Minister to get involved directly in either requesting that former or retired members are met. The board is independent and will make its own independent assessment. If the board judges it necessary to meet and interview anybody it is its sole discretion to do that without let or hindrance from me.Obviously the Chief of Staff, having seen the report, was anxious that some matters be clarified. Given that the event took place many years ago, a number of issues have to be checked and archival material has to be looked at. I have indicated to him that I am anxious to have the matter processed quickly and that the information requested should be made available to him by 1 July 2004. I should see it shortly thereafter after which I will be in direct contact with the Deputy.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I take this opportunity to again extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Second Lieutenant Raymond Heery who was tragically killed in this accident involving an Air Corps Cessna aircraft at Clonbullogue, County Offaly, on 6 May 2004. On learning of the accident the GOC Air Corps immediately instituted an air safety investigation. The investigation team members are drawn from the Air Corps flight safety section and the Military Airworthiness Authority. The purpose of this investigation is to establish all facts pertinent to the accident, to analyse these facts and to produce safety recommendations to prevent future similar accidents. This investigation is ongoing and upon conclusion, a report will be furnished to GOC Air Corps. In addition to the aforementioned investigation, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces is currently convening a military court of inquiry in accordance with Defence Forces regulation A5. The report of the GOC Air Corps air safety investigation, will be one of the items of evidence considered by the military court of inquiry. The Deputy will appreciate it would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause of this tragic accident until these detailed inquiries have been completed.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I join the Minister in expressing my sympathy to the family of Second Lieutenant Heery. I am sure the Minister will agree it is important that the cause of the crash be established. How long will the inquiry take? Have there been preliminary findings from the investigation? Is there an indication as to whether the cause of the crash was mechanical failure or human or other error?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	288	At this stage it would be premature to speculate on the cause of the tragic accident. We have to allow the military court of inquiry and the air investigation to proceed. I can understand why Deputy Sherlock is anxious for me to put a time limit on it. Clearly, since it is done away from the auspices of any Minister or anybody else, I cannot put a time limit on it. I hope it will not take more than a few weeks, but I cannot be certain about that.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Has there been a review of the remainder of the Cessna aircraft?

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I confirm that video footage is available. It will be a matter for the military court of inquiry and the air investigation whether to utilise it. I presume all available information, video footage or otherwise, will be fully utilised to determine the true cause of the accident.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I am pleased to report to the House that the planned procurement of modern light utility and utility helicopters will provide a significant boost to the Air Corps in terms of available flying hours at reduced maintenance costs compared to the existing aircraft in the Air Corps helicopter wing. It will also provide increased capability in the roles currently undertaken by the existing Air Corps light utility helicopters.The procurement process for the acquisition of new helicopters for the Air Corps has commenced. Following discussions between senior officials in my Department and the military authorities, it has been decided that up to six helicopters will be acquired, two light utility helicopters primarily for pilot training, instructor training and instrument flight training and four larger utility helicopters, with the option of two additional such helicopters, for general purpose military operational and training roles which will include training and operations with special forces, security and aid to the civil power, military exercises, infantry interoperability training and limited troop transport. The helicopters will also be required to perform air ambulance, aid to the civil community and VIP transport tasks.The tender competition for the helicopters was advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 29 May 2004. The closing date for the receipt of tenders is Friday, 23 July 2004. The usage of the helicopters will cover a wide spectrum of the Defence Forces' requirements and will not be dedicated for use by any particular element of the Defence Forces, including the Army ranger wing. The helicopters are not being purchased for circumstances envisioned in the Deputy's question. Ireland's commitment to the headline goal consists of an offer of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations stand-by arrangements system. This represents 10% of our Army, a not inconsiderable undertaking by any standard.In the context of the production of the White Paper on Defence of February 2000, the issue of deploying the Air Corps and Naval Service on peace support operations was considered and it was decided that, given the domestic demands on both services' resources, it would not be reasonable for them to participate beyond the domestic environment. There is no commitment of Air Corps or Naval Service resources in Ireland's declaration under the EU Helsinki headline goal or the United Nations stand-by arrangements system. National sovereignty and voluntarism are the fundamental underlying principles of participation in the European Security and Defence Policy. Ireland will approach each proposed peace support operation on a case-by-case basis and will participate only in operations authorised by the United Nations with the approval of the Government and, where appropriate in accordance with the Defence Acts, the approval of this House.

Will these helicopters be available to the Irish Coastguard in its search and rescue work which was transferred to it in the past year, considering the debacle on the west coast and the need for all the helicopters on this island to be available for emergencies at sea?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The arrangements to be made by the Irish Coastguard in terms of the search and rescue service for the islands, seafarers and the coastal community will ultimately be provided by CHCI. However, the type of helicopter being purchased and to be commissioned is a considerable advance on anything we have at the moment. Whatever call is made by any community, whether seafaring, air ambulance, training or transport, the Air Corps has traditionally met that requirement fully. I envisage that circumstances will arise whereby the Air Corps will be asked to supplement from time to time any other available services. These helicopters are specially designed for a wide range of roles. The Deputy's query will be met on some future occasion.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	296	In the context of the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided to decentralise the Civil Defence branch of my Department to Roscrea, County Tipperary. I expect that the move will take place later this year. On 4 May 2004, I wrote to the Chairman of the Civil Defence Board regarding his position. A response has been received within the past few days. I will consider the response at the earliest opportunity but pending such consideration it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the issues involved at this stage.

The Minister has now received a response from the chairman or his legal representatives. When does the Minister expect to bring this matter to a conclusion, as he intended doing a month ago, when he expected it would be settled by now? Has he run into further difficulties not envisaged a month ago?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I have not run into difficulties and I have no reason to change my mind except that the chairman told me that he would be unable to answer my questions as he was taking two weeks holidays. I gave him a further week to enable him to reply to the questions. It seemed fair that I should take account of his holidays and give him some extra time. That time expired a few days ago and the reply has just reached my Department.

I can recall it happening only once or twice in my 20 odd years in the Dáil. Will the Minister elaborate to the House, which is entitled to know, what grievous omissions or activities of the chairman have led to this request for his resignation? He is by all accounts a highly qualified man, he had close associations with the Minister and, without being political, with his party. The House should be told the reasons these drastic steps are being taken.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I do not have a close association with the chairman. I do my job without fear or favour. I have grave reasons for taking this action and all that information will ultimately be available to the House. However, the process of fair play for the individual concerned should give him the fullest possible opportunity to answer the queries I have raised, and that should be done privately before the matter is debated in public. When the Deputy considers his question he will agree that were he here he would do the same. Asking anyone to tender his or her resignation is a serious matter which I would not undertake lightly.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	303	The ministerial air transport section of my Department receives requests on a daily basis regarding the use of the MATS service. Such flights are processed, dependent on the approval of the Taoiseach and the availability of aircraft.On 19 May, 2004 a request was received from the Department of Health and Children regarding a flight from Geneva. The passengers were the Minister for Health and Children and four officials. There were three crew on the flight, the duration of which was approximately four hours.To determine an accurate hourly flying cost for an aircraft, it needs to be in operation for a lengthy period of up to one year. As a result, definitive direct costs for the operation of the Learjet are not yet available. However, the manufacturer's estimated direct flying cost for the Learjet is approximately €1,000 per hour.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	304	Does the Minister accept that this incident represents a gross waste of public money and the limited resources of the Air Corps? Does he believe it appropriate that the Government jet should be sent to collect the Minister for Health and Children and his party who, apparently, could not get to the airport on time to catch their scheduled flight? Are there any statistics available regarding the number of occasions on which Air Corps aircraft have been sent to collect Ministers who missed their flights?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	305	One of the reasons the ministerial air transport service was established was to create as flexible an arrangement as possible to enable the Government to manage the work in which it must engage across Europe, particularly during the Presidency. Most people accept the wisdom of having a facility of that kind in place. From time to time, because of delays in meetings or other unforeseen circumstances, a ministerial group can be stranded and the service is generally provided in order to ensure that a Minister is able to get home on time to attend other meetings, deal with other business demands, etc. It is an excellent, flexible and accountable service and most people would agree that it is operated on a very strict basis by the Taoiseach.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I understand, from figures I have received, that the cost of this flight was approximately €10,000. Was the permission of the Taoiseach's office sought and received in the normal way before the flight took off? Does the Minister envisage any changes in the procedures for the use of Air Corps aircraft by Ministers in light of this farcical waste of public money? In my area, €10,000 could be well spent on dealing with many matters.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	307	One can always make one's case when one makes such farcical deductions about costs. The Learjet is regarded as excellent value for money. The purchase price of the aircraft was provided from savings I made last year. The Learjet has flown on 69 occasions since it was bought on foot of heavy demands from the Taoiseach and Ministers. If there is any complaint to be made about the Taoiseach in terms of his responsibility in this regard, most Ministers would say that he is rather too strict.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	308	Was the permission of the Taoiseach's office sought and granted in this case?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	309	The Deputy can take that for granted. As I indicated in my initial reply, flights on the Learjet or the Gulfstream IV are not made without the permission of the Taoiseach.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 76 together.Work with EU partners towards the establishment of an intergovernmental agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments has been a key priority of the programme of the Irish Presidency of the European Union. Deputies will recall that the conclusions of the European Council held at Thessaloniki in June 2003 tasked the appropriate bodies of the Council to undertake the necessary actions towards creating, in the course of 2004, an intergovernmental agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments.As I have reported to the House on regular occasions during our Presidency, discussions on the establishment of the agency have been ongoing at EU level and were progressed by way of official level meetings held during our Presidency in Brussels and in Dublin. The issue was also discussed during the informal meeting of Defence Ministers held in Brussels in April 2004 and during the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting with Defence Ministers also held in Brussels in May 2004, on which I will report in more detail later. I am pleased to report that political agreement on the joint action to establish the agency was reached at the GAERC meeting on 14 June 2004. It is now intended that formal adoption of the legal act will take place before the end of the Irish Presidency.The overall aim of the agency will be to support member states in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in support of European Security and Defence Policy. At a time when there is little appetite among the EU member states to increase spending on Defence equipment, I have long advocated the necessity to focus on ways in which we can qualitatively improve our capability to carry out peace support operations.We do not need reminding of the increasing demands on the international community to contribute to UN-authorised peace support operations. Current events in Africa, notably in the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as recent events in Kosovo and Liberia, where contingents of the Defence Forces are deployed, have been the cause of serious international concern. If the United Nations is to respond effectively, countries participating on peace support operations in locations such as these must have the necessary resources available, both for the protection of personnel and in order that they may professionally discharge their mandate. It is important, therefore, that the EU should seek to improve competitiveness and efficiency in the defence equipment sector, which has been notable for fragmentation and duplication. The agency is an appropriate method by which this might be achieved. Ireland is not a major consumer of defence equipment. My approach in respect of the creation of the agency and Ireland's participation has been supportive, given that it may yield some economies of scale for equipment procurement for the Defence Forces. In this regard, the question of Ireland's participation in the agency will be considered over the coming weeks. Participation in the framework of the agency would not imply a commitment to participate in any specific project of the agency. Such participation will remain a matter for national decision on a case by case basis.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I thank the Minister for his reply. I had difficulty hearing him at times because there was quite an amount of noise in the Visitor's Gallery. I take it, however, that he has agreed to join the agency. Article III-212 of the draft constitution — which, we believe, will be agreed this weekend — states that the agency shall be open to all member states wishing to be part of it and I take it the Minister, on foot of the reasons he outlined, will avail of this opportunity to join the agency. It has been stated that the agency will increase competitiveness and that harmonisation will result in reduced defence spending for the EU. The average spend in this regard across the EU is approximately 1.9% of GDP, while Ireland's level of spending is the lowest in the European Union. Will the Minister admit that if others are to reduce their spending, Ireland will, in turn, have to increase its spending?

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	313	If we are to increase our spending to match the EU average, will the Government cut spending in the areas of health, education, the environment in order that we will be able to comply with our commitments?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Ireland's participation in the agency will be considered in the coming weeks. Participation in the framework of the agency would not imply a commitment to participate in any specific project.On numerous occasions, and with the limited ability I possess, I have failed to penetrate the Deputy's mind with regard to expenditure on defence in Ireland, who has responsibility for it and what will happen in the future. Expenditure in the defence arena is a sovereign matter in this country and anywhere else. I have no intention of proposing an increase in that or taking funds from education, health and other places. The Deputy would delight in saying how much had been taken out of these areas to spend on defence. He got it wrong and some day he will realise that. I am afraid that in spite of my best efforts, I have failed to convince him.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	315	The Minister has utterly failed to convince me.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 90 together.The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. The strength of the Permanent Defence Force as of 30 April 2004 is as shown in the following table:ServiceOfficersNCOsPrivatesCadetsTotalArmy1,0183,0854,311968,510Air Corps13841033110889Naval Service135464453291,081It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at a level required to meet military needs and as set out in the White Paper, that is, 10,500 Permanent Defence Force, all ranks. The Government remains fully committed to the policy of ongoing recruitment to ensure an overall PDF strength of 10,500 is achieved and maintained. The ongoing recruitment campaign for enlistment in the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address any shortfall in personnel in the Defence Forces. It is proposed to recruit ten cadets to the Naval Service, 50 cadets to the Army and six cadets to the Air Corps from the 2004 cadetship competition. It is intended to recruit 15 apprentices to the Air Corps in 2004. From January 2004 to date, there has been an intake of 165 general service recruits. The requirements for any further intakes will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.

I am sure he appreciates, as we all do, the demands on the Defences Forces both nationally and internationally. The international commitment is becoming more pronounced every year. We were all delighted when our first contingent to Liberia recently returned home safely. I had the pleasure of meeting one member of that contingent in my constituency last week with whom I had a conversation about what went on out there. We appreciate what they are doing.Is the Minister confident the White Paper target of 10,500 personnel is sufficient to meet the demand at national and international level? How many non-commissioned members of the Defence Forces have been taken on this year and will there be another campaign during the remainder of the year?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	318	There have been 165 general recruits this year. Ongoing recruitment is dependent on how the numbers are going. It usually reaches a total of 400 to 500 at the end of the year. I cannot speak specifically for this year, as there was some reduction because of the decision taken in regard to the 10,500 plus the 250 in training. A proportion of that number is obviously affected by that decision.As to whether 10,500 is enough, one could always do with more. That is the decision that has been taken. There are times when we are stretched in meeting our UN requirements. What the public may not often understand is that when there are roughly 800 troops abroad, another 800 troops are in preparation and training to replace them and there may well be another 800 in the early stages of preparation for a subsequent tour of duty. A great deal of training is required for the new missions and we must also ensure safety equipment and so on is dealt with. Overall, it is working well and morale is high. There has been significant investment in equipment and accommodation.The work done by the first contingent to Liberia which set up Camp Clara has been excellent. I am anxious that Front Bench spokespersons in the House and others who are interested would have an opportunity to visit and see at first hand the work that is being done there. I would encourage that very much. The one person I would be delighted to have there is Deputy Gormley. It is necessary for him to go through such a process to be convinced in a way that is not necessary for other Members.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	320	That is most certainly an invitation.

From what I heard from those who returned from Liberia, the Minister's visit there was much appreciated by serving personnel.In addition to difficulties regarding recruitment in the past and more recently, there was a problem with an exodus from certain sections of the Defence Forces. I refer especially to members of the Air Corps and An Slua Muirí. Have these difficulties been overcome and are we able to recruit sufficient personnel to man these two important arms of our Defence Forces? Incentives were given to people who had valuable training to leave the Air Corps. An Slua Muirí had other difficulties. The demands on parts of it were so great that members spent too much time away from home and did not have enough time ashore with their families. Have these difficulties been sorted out and are more recent recruits remaining in the Defence Forces?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	323	When the economy is going well and there are plenty of alternative employment opportunities, people in the Defence Forces, like everywhere else, look to the various options available to them. Civil aviation opportunities exploded for Air Corps pilots in particular, but that has slowed down considerably. The haemorrhage is not as acute as in the past.Other factors must also be taken into account. Non-commissioned officers qualify for a pension after 21 years and officers qualify for a pension and lump sum after 12 years. In theory, an officer could leave in his 30s with a pension for life and a lump sum. The arrangements for the Defence Forces are fairly generous, which sometimes act against us to a degree. The training programmes in the Defence Forces, both in the science and technology areas as well as defence, are highly specialised. Defence Forces members are fit and able people and there has been a significant investment in training and third level education for some. It is desirable to retain such people for as long as possible within the Defence Forces. However, even when people leave, there is not a loss to the economy if they take up other important jobs because the capacity they have developed enhances the work they do in other areas.Overall, it is working reasonably well although there are times we lose specialists. We have particular problems with keeping up the numbers of artificers, engineers and others as far as the Navy is concerned. As I informed Deputies on a previous occasion, we are very troubled in terms of trying to retain medical personnel.

Is a Defence Forces strength of 10,500 sufficient to meet UN and rapid reaction commitments? If we have a rapid reaction commitment the same year, the equivalent of 1,600 personnel would be abroad at any one stage.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The UNSAS and rapid reaction commitments are one and the same and we do not have a doubling of the figure of 850. I would be faced with an horrendous situation if there was a problem in Europe or elsewhere where we had to make an attempt to meet such a demand. We would not be able to meet those needs and that is why they are one and the same. However, that is not to say that in stretched circumstances, depending on the distress and humanitarian needs involved, we would not be able to stretch ourselves a bit further for a temporary period. This is not something I invite, envisage or would be happy about, because it could not be maintained.Will the Deputy remind me of the first part of his question?
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I asked whether there was a specific group or year.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The problem existed in the past. One of the reasons I changed to constant recruitment was because we had periods where there was no recruitment for four or five years and we then had to fill a gap. The circumstance outlined by the Deputy arises from those conditions, where all of these people were the same age and retiring early at the same time. We dealt with that problem and should never invite anything like it again.The age profile is reducing all the time. Both the Gleeson and the earlier report on the Defence Forces said the age profile was too high but it is coming down dramatically and will continue to do so.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	329	These questions were asked earlier.

Leaving that aside, there is no doubt that there are times when we are stretched. We have up to 800 people engaged in UN, OSCE or other missions at present and are stretched when we must cope with potential problems such as foot and mouth disease. On the other hand, the development of the peace process has ensured that the demands on the Border have been considerably reduced. The transit of money, thankfully, is beginning to decline somewhat and there is greater support for the Garda in other matters. The numbers are adequate if——

The purpose of the question was to elicit what plans the Minister has to increase the strength of the various elements of the Defence Forces. The Minister's answer is that he does not propose to increase anything.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	335	The White Paper on Defence specified a ten-year span of 10,500. This was made clear to the public and supported by every party in the House.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	341	On 4 May 2004, I wrote to the chairman of the Civil Defence board regarding his position. A response has been received within the last few days. I will consider the response at the earliest opportunity but pending such consideration it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the issues involved at this stage.

Four years after the move to Roscrea was first announced the move still has not taken place and less than half of the staff have indicated——

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	346	The Chair should hear me out, it is part of the situation. Will the Minister confirm that a premises in Roscrea has been located? Has a contract been signed and will he indicate from whom the building is being leased? These questions have to do with the chairman's position.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	347	The public in my area and this House are aware of the circumstances involved. It is well known that I was anxious this decentralisation would take place to the old Sacred Heart convent in Roscrea. Unfortunately, because of costs associated with the restoration and development of the building to meet the requirements of health and safety, that proved too expensive.The Office of Public works, which has direct responsibility for the matter of providing Government offices for civil services, then asked for expressions of interest. I understand there were four of these and the OPW decided on one of them independently. Work has been carried out on that building and I understand the tender process for fitting out the final stages is in hand. Some 12 members of the existing staff in Dublin have indicated their wish to transfer to Roscrea and over 100 other applicants from other Departments have also signified an interest in coming to Roscrea. It is clear sufficient numbers are interested in moving there.The premises is owned by six people who live in or near Roscrea town. One of those was a Fianna Fáil public representative. The decision on that premises had nothing to do with me and I had no hand, act or part in the matter. I resent the implications that I have been involved in some way. It is well known I did not want the Civil Defence to go to that building but to the old Sacred Heart school where it could continue the tradition of education. The Office of Public Works, for good sound reasons, could not proceed on that and independently sought other premises.I stand over the arrangements made and resent the insinuations. The people of my home town responded positively to them in a way which is the only democratic answer I can give.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	348	Will the Minister confirm that the chairman of the Civil Defence regards the proposed premises as totally unsuitable? Is it appropriate that he should seek the removal of the chairman of the board simply because he objects to the poorly thought out plan?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I have no say in the type of building which will be decided on by the Office of Public Works for the Civil Defence. The OPW decides independently and is an expert in such decisions. I will not go into detail as to why I sought the chairman's resignation, although I admit the decentralisation to Roscrea is part of the reason. There may also be other more fundamental reasons.At this stage I do not wish to say any more, beyond the fact that when the building is fitted out and people see what has been done, I am quite confident the people who will come and work there will be very happy with the accommodation provided for them.

In addition, the standing orders, SOs, of Irish units on United Nations overseas service lay down strict guidelines expressly prohibiting inappropriate fraternisation with local persons. Any infringement of these SOs constitutes an offence under military law. The Code of Personal Conduct for Blue Helmets as laid down by the United Nations unambiguously requires all peacekeepers to refrain from "immoral acts of physical or psychological abuse or exploitation of local population, especially women and children". Any infringement of this code constitutes an offence under military law.

He will also be aware of the UN inquiry into allegations of sexual exploitation of local women in the Democratic Republic of Congo by UN peacekeepers. He will also remember the horrific discovery only two years ago that Irish peacekeepers sexually exploited and made pornographic videos of local women in Eritrea. Concerns have been raised recently about the potential for similar circumstances or situations to occur in Liberia.What steps have been taken by the Minister and the Defence Forces to prevent other Irish peacekeepers from engaging in such behaviour while abroad or at home? When will the recommendations of the Doyle report on sexual harassment, assault and other sexual misconduct in the Defence Forces be fully implemented?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	367	An investigation into the incidents in Eritrea was carried out and charges were brought under the Defence Act 1954. The charges were proven against four soldiers who were reprimanded, warned and fined. I understand that further charges are pending in the case of one individual soldier. I have outlined in my earlier reply the standing orders and the system which is operated by the Defence Forces to ensure personal conduct is above reproach.The UN report on the Kosovo matter was somewhat unbalanced, but nevertheless there was trafficking. There may have been up to 60 incidents involving members of the international community and regarding which charges are being made. It is being dealt with in a strong and deliberate manner because such behaviour is unacceptable. As far as the Defence Forces are concerned, the only incidents, regrettable as they are, are those involving a small number of soldiers who served in Eritrea. It is not acceptable to have even one case, not to mind the others.

What additional steps will be taken, considering there has been a series of incidents? The UN will obviously need to examine them again because there have been three incidents in a row involving peacekeepers and, thankfully, only one incident involving the Defence Forces. Ireland has a good record. Additional steps to reinforce the standing orders need to be taken by both the UN and the Defence Forces. What steps would the Minister suggest?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I accept the points made by the Deputy. Once I became aware of these incidents, I asked the Chief of Staff to ensure that the highest standards were imposed and met. The Defence Forces have a unique and very satisfactory record. I do not wish to see their record tarnished in any way and I will be happy to undertake any action required at ministerial level.

All these matters are covered comprehensively in the training programmes, the code of conduct is explained and medical personnel are involved. I have visited all these countries and I am happy with the standards, their application and the efforts made by the Defence Forces. Senior personnel act in a most responsible manner in all these areas.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I propose to take Question Nos. 66 and 74 together.KFOR was established on 10 June 1999, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244, for an initial period of 12 months, to continue thereafter unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise. The role of KFOR is to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo to allow a climate of safety and security to develop which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities.Ireland has participated in KFOR since August 1999. The mission is authorised under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and was approved by Dáil Éireann on 1 July 1999, following a Government decision of 29 June 1999. Since then, the Government has reviewed and approved annually continued participation by the Defence Forces in KFOR. On 27 May 2003, the Government approved continued participation by a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force in KFOR for a further period of 12 months beyond June 2003.The Irish contingent comprises an infantry group of 213 personnel together with a number of personnel in staff posts at various headquarters. The infantry group was first deployed last September. Previously, a transport group had been deployed with KFOR since August 1999. Three Defence Forces personnel also serve with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK.The Irish infantry group operates as part of a multinational grouping within the Finnish-Irish battle group. It comprises a Mowag APC mounted company with support and logistic elements. The main tasks of the Irish infantry group include the following: provision of general security to all ethnic groups, institutions and cultural sites; provision of support to UNMIK police and other agencies with security tasks; identification of and reporting on extremist groups and activities; vehicle and foot patrols; vehicle checkpoints; and operation of observation posts.It had been anticipated that a re-organisation and scaling down of KFOR would take place this year. This had partly commenced when civil disturbances broke out in March. The withdrawal of the Irish contingent was planned as part of this reduction in KFOR presence and was to have been completed by October 2004. However, having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo and subject to ongoing assessments of the position on the ground, Ireland will continue to maintain an appropriate presence in KFOR in 2004. Later this month, I intend to bring proposals to Government with regard to the continued participation by the Defence Forces in KFOR beyond June 2004.Members of the 27th infantry group of the Defence Forces were serving in Kosovo at the time of the serious outbreak of violence in March 2004. A major contribution was made by Irish personnel in protecting Serb enclaves in and around Pristina. In holding the line against overwhelming numbers of Kosovan Albanians, the Irish Defence Forces saved numerous lives and the homes of Serb families from certain destruction. In addition, members of the Defence Forces based in KFOR headquarters, on their own initiative and at no little risk to their own safety, went into Pristina at the height of the disturbances and evacuated more than 340 Serbians to safety, without doubt saving their lives in the process.Letters of commendation were awarded to 18 Irish personnel by the commanding general of the multinational brigade centre, in whose brigade the Irish personnel serve, for their actions during the course of the disturbances. The commendations were for leadership, initiative and brave participation in the rescue team, which also included other nationalities. Thankfully, the personnel involved suffered only minor injuries. I am advised by the military authorities that, while tension still exists in Serb minority areas, the current security situation in Kosovo is described as being calm in most areas.

He stated that some of our personnel serving on the KFOR mission suffered minor injuries. How many personnel were involved? Is the Minister satisfied with the level of medical backup available to our forces on the mission?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	374	While I do not know the exact number of personnel involved, it was higher than 18, the number of those who received commendations. The personnel in question suffered only minor injuries. One of the features of their success was the speed with which they acted. It appears that other contingents were awaiting directions from home, making contact with the relevant ministries and so forth, whereas the Irish, because of the experience they had gained in different missions, were aware that time is of the essence and acted quickly. I am very grateful and proud of them.As regards the Deputy's second question, one could never be fully happy with the medical backup available. The medical facilities available in Kosovo are good and would not be available in other places. As I indicated to the Deputy in an earlier reply, despite placing a number of advertisements and attempting to recruit more medical personnel, the Department remains very stretched in terms of meeting medical requirements and having medical personnel employed directly in the Defence Forces. In recent weeks, I have been compelled to move towards using agencies to meet all medical requirements for the safety or our troops on missions.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I may have missed a point. What is the expected level of commitment after 2004 and will the Minister make a statement on that matter?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	376	Notwithstanding our original intention, the Government, as a result of the fragility of the situation in Kosovo and the disturbances which took place in March, including the destruction of property and the killing and injuring of people, is concerned to maintain a significant presence in Kosovo for a longer period. We have not yet come to a conclusion on the timeframe of the mission but we will keep the matter under review. As a result, the question of withdrawal in October no longer stands.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	377	Is the Kosovo Liberation Army still in existence? If so, does it pose a threat to Irish personnel on the ground?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	378	The KLA still exists. The security situation in Kosovo is considerably better now than previously but I am informed at times that the region is like a match and can light up at any time. The troubles and disturbances in March frightened everybody a little because matters had been proceeding very well before suddenly becoming very vicious. One of the reasons we are maintaining a presence in Kosovo is that nobody can be confident that the same circumstances will not arise again. While that may be unlikely, the security position remains fragile.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 78 together.The Defence Forces contingent deployed for service with the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL, in December 2003 comprises a motorised infantry battalion of some 435 personnel. A small number of additional personnel have also been deployed at force headquarters and as military observers. Initial deployment will be for one year, with a possible extension thereafter, subject to renewal of the UN mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission. In the case of UNMIL, my intention is that Defence Forces' involvement will not exceed two to three years in duration. Elections, which are due in 2005 under the comprehensive peace agreement, should be completed at that stage.At the request of the UN, a contingent of the Army Ranger wing, numbering some 40 personnel, was deployed for a three-month period from December 2003 to February 2004. This contingent has now returned home. Sadly, as Deputies will recall, Sergeant Derek Mooney of the Army Ranger wing lost his life while on duty in Liberia and one of his colleagues was injured.The 90th infantry battalion has recently returned home having successfully completed its tour of duty and has been replaced by the 91st infantry battalion which has just begun a six-month tour of duty.The main Irish contingent operates as the force commander's rapid reaction reserve. The role of the Irish personnel is the provision of an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force to provide a swift and decisive military reaction to any crisis.To date, the Irish battalion in UNMIL has mainly operated in a path-finding and reconnaissance role supporting the deployment of other UN contingents. It has also conducted long range patrols beyond Monrovia and well into the interior of Liberia in order to display a strong UN presence, deter lawlessness and protect local populations. The contingent also undertakes regular daily patrols within the Monrovia area. While the UN contingents have now deployed to their areas of operation throughout Liberia, the Irish battalion remains available to the force commander to provide support and a rapid response capability in the event of a breakdown in law and order or further conflict.A wide range of equipment and force protection assets has been deployed with the contingent, including Mowag APCs, armoured vehicles and support weapons, heavy machine guns and mortars. Due to the equipment modernisation programmes in the Defence Forces in recent years, our UNMIL units are the best equipped ever to serve overseas.I visited Irish troops serving with UNMIL during the period 21 to 23 January 2004 and observed at first hand the work of Irish military personnel serving in the area. I conveyed to them, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, our deep appreciation for the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service. UNMIL is a challenging assignment and the Defence Forces are to be congratulated on the expeditious manner in which they planned and undertook their first deployment to this mission.Camp Clara, the headquarters of the Irish troops serving with the 91st infantry battalion, UNMIL, is located ten kilometres from the main town of Monrovia. Since its deployment, the Irish battalion has put a significant amount of work into the establishment and development of the camp, including the provision of recreation and training facilities. Additional facilities have been added and further facilities will be added in the future as appropriate.Deputies will be aware that the adoption of a number of local humanitarian projects is a feature of Irish peace support operations. While in Liberia, I visited an AIDS hospice run by the Missionaries of Charity — the order of Mother Theresa, now St. Theresa — which is being assisted on a personal voluntary basis by members of the Irish battalion. During this visit to the hospice, it gave me great pleasure in announcing that Development Co-operation Ireland is contributing €15,000 to the humanitarian work of the current contingent in this regard. I have also allocated €10,000 from the Vote for the Department of Defence to the contingent to support this important humanitarian work.During my visit I found morale among troops to be very high. I congratulated the Irish personnel on the success of their mission so far and observed the positive effect their presence is already having in Monrovia and other areas since their arrival.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I congratulate our troops serving in Liberia. Before they were deployed, the Minister informed the House this would be a dangerous mission. Have our troops been engaged in firefights with local militia?I refer to the Mowag APCs. Last spring, the Minister informed us a number had experienced hairline cracks. Is that equipment all right? Will he give the House an assurance that all the equipment being used in Liberia is in order?The Minister mentioned modernisation. The Department recently invited tenders to supply the Air Corps with six new military helicopters. Are they capable of being used in Liberia and, if so, is it intended to deploy them there? Is the purchase related to the headline goals for the rapid reaction force?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	381	The White Paper specifically outlines that both the Naval Service and the Air Corps will not be involved in UN missions and, therefore, there is no commitment under the UNSAS or rapid reaction force agreements to use the Naval Service or the Air Corps.The helicopters will be primarily and virtually exclusively used as air ambulances and for training and search and rescue operations and other activities for which modern helicopters can be called into service.We accept the security situation in Liberia remains serious. Monrovia is medium risk but the further one travels from Monrovia, one moves into higher risk areas. More than 13,000 troops are deployed in Liberia and this number will increase to 15,000. The greater the expansion in UN control, the more improvement there will be in security.The 19th battalion has been involved in a number of incidents. Troops rescued 30 people who had been held captive and abused by the militia in one incident 300 kms from Monrovia.With regard to the hairline cracks on the Mowags, we had useful consultation with the manufacturers. The APCs we purchased were among the first eight or ten to be commissioned. There have been no problems since. Other people have travelled to Ireland to see them in operation and a number of other armies are purchasing similar Mowags. We are happy the arrangements made to satisfy the conditions of the contract were fully met in this regard.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 119 together.Ireland's participation in PfP to date is set out in our four individual partnership programmes, IPPs, copies of which have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library. Activities consist of training courses, seminars, workshops, conferences, staff exercises and table top exercises. Ireland's fourth IPP, covering the period 2004 to 2005, has been completed in consultation with the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Environment and Local Government, Justice Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.As provided for in the presentation document for PfP, Ireland also participates in the PfP planning and review process known as PARP. In common with other EU neutrals, Ireland is using the PARP process in connection with planning for the Petersberg Tasks. The scope of our involvement in PARP is focused on enhancing interoperability and familiarity with operating procedures in a multinational environment.Participation in Partnership for Peace activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Does the Minister agree PfP is a crucial element in the development of NATO? Does he accept the concept of interoperability is part and parcel of increasing the effectiveness of NATO and that PfP was a lifeline for the organisation because it had become stagnant? Does he further accept Ireland ought not to participate in PfP because, as the Taoiseach emphasised at the time, it compromises our neutrality?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I disagree fundamentally with the Deputy, not for the first time. PfP helps the Defence Forces to keep very much abreast of developments in training and in the humanitarian aspects of peacekeeping missions. I do not know if it is properly understood and I do not wish to pretend that I know more about this than anybody else.Peacekeeping missions have been undertaken in Eritrea, Liberia, Kosovo and East Timor, and our troops have operated side by side with those from 30 other countries who have received different training and come from different cultural backgrounds. Understanding the contingents immediately beside the Irish contingent is fundamental to their safety and security and to the operation itself. Training and co-operation is needed to get to the point where each contingent understands how the other operates. The safety of our troops is important in the first instance followed by the peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks.Troops participating in these missions encounter distress, suffering, conflict, murder and genocide. I have given examples previously. The Deputy and I will sit down some day and agree on this. He will be so happy to realise there is no basis for the worries he has expressed trenchantly over the years.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

In page 4, line 40, to delete "Subject to subsection (2),”.The purpose of amendments Nos. 2 and 3 is to have consistency within the Act. According to the first amendment, the competent authority is deemed to be the Garda Commissioner. We are changing that in the second amendment so that the competent authority there is also the Garda Commissioner. It seems in the first instance that the Garda Commissioner is given power in one area but that the Minister holds power in the second area for himself. At the very least this should be consistent and should apply to one or the other. That consistency should apply to the Garda Commissioner who should have the power in both instances rather than the Minister. As we also saw in the Garda Bill, the Minister seems anxious to cede quite a bit of power in his own direction, although the current Minister will not always be in that position. It would be better if decisions rested with the Garda Commissioner.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Section 2 names the competent Irish authorities for the purposes of the framework decision. Section 2(1) provides that the Garda Commissioner will be the competent authority for the State, but section 2(2) qualifies this by providing that where the competent authority of another member state requires that the request for establishment of a joint investigation team should be made or received by a judicial authority the Minister and not the Garda Commissioner will be the competent authority in dealing with such requests. The amendment proposed by the Deputy would result in the Commissioner being the sole competent authority for the purposes of the Bill. The responsibility for setting up and operating the joint teams will rest with the Garda Commissioner.Deputies appear to have a difficulty in understanding why the Minister is designated as a competent authority. As was explained when this matter arose on Committee Stage and during the passage of the Bill through the other House, other member states may require a judicial authority rather than chiefs of police as competent authorities in accordance with either their legislative or constitutional arrangements. Those member states will not send or accept requests from the Garda Commissioner. For that reason the Minister must be designated a competent authority by the Bill if the framework decision is to achieve its objective of combating cross-border and international crime.In practice, this does not mean the Minister will be involved in setting up and operating joint teams. His only role will be to receive the request and transmit it to the Garda Commissioner who will decide if it is necessary to set up a team. The Minister will then notify the relevant requesting authority of the Commissioner's decision. If a team is to be established in the State, arrangements for the establishment and operation of the team will be put in place by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister will have no further involvement.By providing for the Minister to be a competent authority, we are merely ensuring that we can do business with those member states which will not recognise the Garda Commissioner as a competent authority for the purpose of the framework decision. I therefore see no reason to accept this amendment.

I accept what he has said but I question the fact that we must take on trust that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will pass a request on to the Garda Commissioner. If that is all his role involves, I do not see why the Garda Commissioner cannot do that in the first place. That other member states may accept him also implies that they may not accept him as a competent authority and they can decide whether to go to the Garda Commissioner. I assume the Commissioner's role is one defined by law in Ireland and it should be up to Ireland to decide who to designate for other countries to deal with. I see no difficulty in that person being the Commissioner rather than the Minister.

There is no consensus throughout Europe and the importance of the Bill is that it allows cross-border investigations. When an urgent investigation is needed and it is necessary to set up a joint team, we do not want a legal situation where someone queries the competence of the Garda Commissioner. This is the way it must be to be sure.

In page 6, after line 49, to insert the following:"(c) the proposed members of the joint investigation team satisfy the human rights criteria under section 6(5) (b) and (c), and the Competent Authority has received confirmation from the competent authority or authorities in the Member State or States concerned as required under section 8(2).”.These amendments relate to the same issue, that is, the need for human rights screening for members of foreign police forces who will operate in the State as members of joint investigation teams. In its entirety, the Bill is part of a series of so-called EU anti-terrorism roadmap measures which would allow members of foreign police forces and, possibly, intelligence agencies to operate in this State following permission from the Garda Commissioner.I am not opposed in principle to inter-jurisdictional police co-operation in investigations of serious crime with cross-border dimensions, limited where necessary and where there are appropriate safeguards and accountability mechanisms in place. We strongly support effective action against cross-border organised crime, including trafficking in human beings and drugs, especially where such actions strike the correct balance between the need and right of communities and individuals to be safe from predation and the civil and human rights of individuals.The Bill does not fit the criteria I have outlined, especially when it comes to human rights safeguards and accountability mechanisms. Whatever about the elements of the Bill I support, it would be irresponsible of us to allow the operation of other forces in this jurisdiction in the absence of a properly established best practice complaints investigations mechanism in the form of an independent Garda ombudsman office along the lines of the Patten model and a properly established best practice civilian oversight mechanism in the form of an independent civilian policing board as our party and others have suggested, including non-governmental organisations which deal with these issues.The Bill should specifically outline conditions and that is why amendments Nos. 4, 7, 9 and 10 outline conditions under which it would be prohibited to bring other police forces or individual members of other police forces on to a joint investigation team operating in this State. Fundamentally, this legislation must not proceed in the absence of adequate safeguards and, in particular, until such time as the Human Rights Commission is convinced of the adequacy of the Bill's provisions and the State's mechanism for police accountability.On that point, it was not acceptable for the Minister to refuse to seek assurance from the Human Rights Commission that it was convinced of the adequacy of the human rights safeguards in this legislation before Committee Stage, as I requested. That was a pity because we would have got a better line and my amendments might have been better informed if the Minister had accepted the Human Rights Commission's view and sought assurance from it that it was happy with the safeguards in the legislation. To the best of my knowledge, there has been no assurance from the Human Rights Commission and I do not believe the Minister sought one. That is wrong because the Human Rights Commission was set up, in particular, to view legislation and to point out where it is inadequate and where it would impact or impinge on people's human rights. This is legislation in respect of which that should have been done. In cases where legislation impinges on or interferes with people's human rights, we should be fully informed of it and take whatever steps are necessary to amend it.We are talking about police co-operation. It is crucial that we ensure people have confidence in the officers serving them, and that includes all officers, whether members of the Garda Síochána or police officers from other jurisdictions. Officers may come from a different policing culture, including a more aggressive and combative one than the Garda Síochána. Despite incidents of abuse and aggression on the part of members of the Garda Síochána, in general the culture of the force has not been a combative or aggressive one. Members of the Garda Síochána are now being given human rights training and we should demand the same of police officers coming here from abroad. Human rights qualifications and misconduct screening must be essential prerequisites for members of joint investigation teams. We cannot have a situation where members of other police forces who have been found guilty or who are under investigation for misconduct or human rights breaches come to Ireland. That should be the minimum we accept.The Minister will no doubt argue that he does not have any concerns about the police forces of other EU member states and that my amendments are unnecessary. I remind the House of Amnesty International's documented police ill-treatment, excessive use of force and torture as well as impunity for such misconduct in 16 EU member states, including Austria, Belgium, Britain, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia and Sweden. Some of those documented cases have resulted in death, so there is cause for concern and we cannot give a free hand to police forces. We need to put in place these safeguards.If Members wish, I can list the recent incidents in EU states. It is not true to say EU police forces are generally human rights compliant. That is the source of my concern about the absence of screening mechanisms to prevent officers from other states who may be engaged in such misconduct from serving in this State or even members of the Garda Síochána who are the subject of such inquiries from serving abroad.In January of this year, Amnesty International urged the Irish Presidency of the EU to ensure that any arrangements for increased co-operation among EU police forces give due consideration to international human rights standards and best practice, adequate mechanisms of accountability and the provision for training so that law enforcement officers are equipped to ensure the full protection of human rights. The provisions of amendments Nos. 4, 7, 9 and 10 and amendments No. 17, which we are not discussing at present but which are related, should be included in the legislation.Those are the main concerns and I hope the Minister of State accepts the amendments. The Minister and the junior Minister have not been able to attend as I heard they are on EU duties. If that is the case, they would have known in advance and this Bill should be rescheduled for another occasion. This is the second Bill from the justice portfolio we are discussing today but neither the Minister nor the junior Minister is present. It is not the first time this has happened and it is scandalous. This Bill should have been rescheduled so a Minister responsible for this major change to our policing arrangements and the EU is here to discuss it.

There is a target date at EU level to implement this legislation across the European Union. The House and the Minister are anxious to complete it by the end of this summer term.

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I guarantee the Deputy that next Tuesday and Wednesday are chock-a-block with legislation to be dealt with by the House, as is the schedule up to 10 p.m. tonight. I assure the Deputy I will reflect the Minister's position on this issue.I propose to respond to amendments Nos. 4, 7, 9 and 10 together. The Deputy also referred to amendment No. 17 which I will deal with separately. The purpose of the amendments tabled by Deputy Ó Snodaigh is to ensure no agreement is reached to establish a joint investigation team unless there is confirmation that persons appointed under section 6(2)(c) have: completed human rights training in this State or in their own member state; are not subject to investigation or inquiry; and that teams be terminated when credible allegations of misconduct arise.Persons appointed under section 6(2)(c) could include, for example, experts in forensic science, fingerprinting, computer experts, statisticians or research assistants, depending on the nature of the investigation, or representatives of authorities other than the member states of the EU. Persons appointed to a team in this context shall, in accordance with section 7(1)(a), perform their functions in accordance with the law of the State. In accordance with section 7(1)(b), they will operate under the control and general superintendence of the Garda Commissioner. Section 7(2)(b) provides that members of a team will perform their functions under the direction and control of the team leader who will be appointed by the Garda Commissioner. Persons who are authorised to participate in an investigation in this way will act primarily in a supportive role and will not be permitted to take investigative measures.The Garda Síochána is developing a strategy on human rights education training which will set out the vision for human rights training for all gardaí. The proposed strategy envisaged that human rights training will be imparted to new trainees and current serving members as part of an in-service training module following further developments of the human rights training programme. At present the Garda Síochána provide human rights and diversity training for trainee gardaí. A two-day inspectors and sergeants development course entitled, human rights, anti-racism and ethics, aims to provide a basic introduction to international human rights standards.To further enhance and support human rights training, a generic human rights training course for Garda teachers and trainers has been developed and was delivered in 2003 to 132 teacher trainers, and this course is continuing this year. The aim of the course is to facilitate the integration of human rights concerns, norms, principles and ethics into all relevant aspects of training courses. In accordance with best practice, the course was delivered by internal and external experts. It also proposed to involve staff from the Garda human rights office and the racial and intercultural office as well as Amnesty International and the University of Ulster.In the event that members of the PSNI are appointed to a team, the Deputy should be aware that all PSNI officers have received training in the application of the Human Rights Act 1998. More recently, all PSNI officers have been trained in the code of ethics, which has been drafted to reflect the ECHR, relevant United Nations standards and best practice in ethical policing in the UK and other countries. All PSNI officers are required by law to carry out their duties in accordance with the code of ethics published by the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Human rights are fully integrated in all police recruiting training.In the Garda Síochána Bill, which was published in February of this year, the key functions of the force are now to be defined by statute. Section 7(4) provides that in exercising these functions, the Garda Síochána will be obliged to have regard to the importance of upholding human rights in the performance of their duties. In addition, a revised form of attestation, provided for in section 15, will require new members of the force to declare, inter alia, that they will have regard for human rights in carrying out their duties.Furthermore, the importance of human rights is strengthened by the inclusion of a provision for the establishment of a code of ethics which will be incorporated into a disciplinary framework for the Garda Síochána. The purpose of the code of ethics is to lay down standards of conduct and practice for police officers and to make them aware of their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. On the basis of the facts as outlined, the Deputy will note that the Garda Síochána is well aware of human rights issues. Any persons appointed to joint teams will operate under its control.Section 6(6)(b) empowers the Minister, if requested by the Commissioner, to remove any team member appointed under section 6(2). This is any non-Garda member. Removal for reasons of misconduct would fall into the terms of this provision. It is not appropriate that a bureaucratic mechanism of assessment of personnel be established in advance of the establishment of joint teams. After all, we must allow chiefs of police the flexibility to assign and rotate or replace personnel who will progress an investigation in the best manner possible. They will not wish to detract from combating and detecting crime by appointing personnel who are likely to impact adversely on this role.For the reasons outlined, I do not propose to accept this amendment.

I acknowledged the work of the gardaí in the human rights field in recent times and welcomed the integration of a code of ethics. That is provided in respect of the Garda Síochána but not in respect of police forces which will send representatives to this country as part of these joint investigation teams.As the Minister of State mentioned, there is a power under section 6(6)(b) to remove a member of such a team. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that in the first instance such officers from other jurisdictions do not become part of a joint investigation team once there is any type of doubt about their competence in operating here. The competence in question in these amendments is whether the persons concerned have been involved in human rights abuse or any type of abuse of suspects or those who are charged.I listed those countries where there have been incidents of abuse and perhaps it is worth giving some examples. In Belgium, police ill-treatment was often accompanied by racist abuse and a standing police monitoring committee reported a worrying increase in complaints against the Belgian police related to racism and physical violence. In Estonia, the UN Committee Against Torture reported that ill-treatment of detainees by the Estonian police persists, albeit on a lesser scale than previously. In France, instances of police brutality frequently involve foreign nationals or French nationals of foreign regions. German police have ill-treated and used excessive force against detainees. Greek police frequently ill-treat detainees. In Hungary, police ill-treatment, particularly of Roma people, continues to be reported. Those are only brief samples of instances on which I have information. The position is the same in Spain.We are trying to ensure in these amendments that those who are under investigation in their own countries, or in respect of whom there have been findings of ill-treatment or abuse, cannot be sent here by the police authorities in those countries to carry out the same types or other types of activities here. They are not welcome. These amendments seek to ensure that only those who are willing to comply with these standards can take part in joint operations in this jurisdiction. We need to ensure that Garda human rights training here sets the ball rolling for the rest of the European Union and that other police forces take on board the need for such human rights training. If they are to operate here, they will need to have undergone some human rights training. That should be a minimum requirement. We should not accept anything less.

In page 7, lines 5 to 7, to delete all words from and including "if" in line 5 down to and including "Authority" in line 7 and substitute the following:"for such periods not exceeding its duration since establishment, or if the circumstances so require, for such periods as may be agreed by the Competent Authority in consultation with the Minister".The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that any extensions of time given should not exceed the original length of time for which the investigation is due to operate. I can understand that work may not be completed within the time frame set, but it might not be the best decision to give indefinite time extensions and the work involved could continue on for longer than envisaged. We know from our experience of the current tribunals that if timetables are not set, processes can continue indefinitely with no end in sight. If the approach proposed was taken, the team could seek a further extension if necessary, but at least there would be some controls in place over the length of time it is envisaged these investigations would take. That is the reason we tabled this amendment.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	404	The terms of this amendment have previously been raised in both Houses and the arguments made in rejecting it then still apply. Section 5, provides that a joint investigation team will be established for specific purposes and a limited period, and that where it is necessary to do so, that period may be extended for an additional period or additional periods as are agreed by the competent authorities concerned. The proposed amendment allows the period of time for which a joint team is to operate to be extended but sets a limit on that extension to be a period "not exceeding its duration since establishment". In other words, a joint investigation team, which has been established for four months, should only be extended for an additional four month period unless circumstances require a different arrangement to apply. It is impossible to see how this could work in practice. As the investigation progresses it will only become clear how much time is required to complete the investigation. When it becomes evident that more time is needed to progress the investigation, the written agreement provided for in section 8, drawn up between the member states, will have to be amended. It would not make much sense to have to amend an agreement say three times over the course of the subsequent year when it would have been quite clear from the outset that a further period of a year was required to complete the investigation. Where no further benefit is likely to accrue from the continued operation of the team, the Commissioner will terminate the team in accordance with section 5(7)(b). Where the purposes for which the team was established have been achieved in advance of the time period allocated, the Commissioner will also terminate the team in accordance with section 5 (7)(a). However, where an investigation has not been completed, the time period for which it is to operate will have to be extended. To do so in the limited manner proposed by the Deputy does not make sense. I am sure other member states involved in the establishment of teams would also consider it a strange way of doing business.Deputies fear that the provision, as drafted, will not result in the most effective use of manpower and resources and will impose an unnecessary financial burden on the State. As the Minister has previously stated, joint investigation teams are not a new phenomenon. They have been a feature of international co-operation on an informal basis for many years. It is not expected that the cost of operating joint teams arising from this Bill will differ in any significant way from the costs that have accrued in the past.While enactment of this legislation may lead to some increase in co-operation between the Garda Síochána and foreign law enforcement authorities, it is unlikely to have significant resource implications, as existing co-operation arrangements will continue to apply, albeit in a more structured format. The teams will only be set up in exceptional circumstances to investigate cross-border crime, especially organised crime.As the person answerable for the strategic goal in the Garda policing plan concerning the management of finances to achieve best value for money, the Garda Commissioner will take into consideration the cost of, benefit to, and possible burden on existing resources when deciding whether or not to take part in a team. There must be an element of flexibility to cater for the different scenarios and rapid responses which will be required.The provisions in section 7 of the Bill for termination of the team when its purposes have been achieved, or when there is no further benefit to be gained from its continued operation, together with the provision to amend the agreement when the period of a team is to be extended, are sufficient safeguards to ensure teams do not continue to operate for unnecessarily long or ineffective periods.For these reasons I do not propose to accept this amendment.

He is not accepting the amendment because he says it does not make sense to extend the period for only a limited time, but one must ask why the period is being limited in the first place. Clearly, this amendment will not be accepted by the Government but it would be a better way of doing things if it were. It is not even that limiting because it still gives the power "if the circumstances so require, for such periods as may be agreed by the competent authority in consultation with the Minister". The amendment would add commonsense to the Bill's provisions.

In page 7, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:"(2) Each joint investigation to be established under this Act shall be costed by the Competent Authority prior to establishment.".In many instances, drug seizure operations are already costed prior to being sanctioned. That is a good precedent, which we should consider applying in this legislation. We are all aware that there is a cost issue regarding how resources for the Garda Síochána are allocated and spent. We should be in a position to cost operations in so far as possible. It is not always that simple to achieve, but it is worth trying in order to ensure that when operations are sanctioned we will be able to ascertain the costs involved before they proceed.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	408	This amendment was previously tabled in both Houses. Joint investigation teams have already been established in the State on an informal basis. The costs associated with them arising from the implementation of this legislation are not expected to be over and above those that have accrued in the past. A total of 12 joint investigation teams have been set up in the State over the past six years. It is, therefore, not as if this is likely to be an everyday event. Four of these teams were in respect of subversive, terrorist-related activity and the remaining eight were in respect of serious organised crime.The Garda Commissioner provides the initiative in deciding to set up a joint investigation team in this State or become involved in a team in another state. He will calculate costs to ensure that taxpayers' money is being spent in an efficient and cost-effective manner.The Garda policing plan for 2004 lists ten strategic goals, one of which is financial management and accountability. It would not be possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the cost of a joint investigation team in advance of its establishment, as the costs will vary greatly and will be determined by the nature of the investigation, the type of offence or suspected offence to be investigated, the size of the team, the length of the investigation and the resources available to the team.To include a condition in legislation that each joint investigation team should be costed in advance could delay a rapid response to requests and hamper the course of the investigation, thereby defeating the purpose of establishing the team. While it may be good management practice to be aware of the financial implications of an investigation and to plan the most effective use of resources successfully to pursue that investigation, it does not make any sense to compromise the safety of citizens by having a costing exercise as a mandatory requirement before proceeding, or to have it as a determining factor in deciding whether to proceed.I am aware of Deputies' concerns that the most effective use be made of resources but, as indicated in response to previous amendments, there are safeguards in place to terminate teams where the objective has been achieved or where there is no benefit to accrue from the continuation of the team.There is the further issue that I do not have the power to compel other member states of the EU to cost joint investigation teams prior to establishment, as this amendment seeks to do. For these reasons I do not propose to accept this amendment.

In page 8, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:"(3) Where a person is appointed by the Minister to be a member of a joint investigation team pursuant to subsection (2)(c), he or she shall be deemed to be an officer of the Minister for the duration of his or her membership of the team.”.Amendment No. 8 seeks to amend section 6 which deals with membership and terms and conditions of membership of joint investigation teams. Section 6(1)(c) allows persons from the private sector, such as computer experts or statisticians, to be appointed to a joint investigation committee. A serious question arises about the accountability of such persons for their conduct while members of the team. The amendment would make the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform accountable for the conduct of such persons. In some ways this section is highly inappropriate. To give police-style powers or functions, one should at least be a public official of some kind, otherwise where is the accountability? It could suggest CIA style freelance operators, although this is not what the Minister of State has in mind.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	415	This matter was previously raised on Committee Stage and in the other House. As I indicated then, the purpose of the provision in section 6(2)(c) is to enable the Minister, following consultation with relevant parties, to appoint any other person who does not fit into the categories in section 6(2)(a) or (b) and who, in his or her opinion, has experience relevant to the investigation. The provision will ensure that whatever expertise or advice is needed by a team is available. The Minister has the power to look beyond the Civil Service to provide this experience and advice. The EU framework decision makes specific provision for the inclusion of additional expertise from appropriate persons. These can include such personnel as fingerprints experts, systems analysts, computer programmers, accountants, statisticians or any other persons who, in the opinion of the Ministers, have experience or expertise relevant to the investigation concerned.While in the majority of cases the necessary expertise will be found among the members of the Garda Síochána and the officers of Ministers and the Revenue Commissioners I expect there will be occasions when a joint investigation team may be established which will require something above and beyond the necessary expertise already available. Such persons, if required, would likely be appointed on a once off basis and may only be involved in a particular aspect for a particular period of the investigation and could, for example, be from the private sector area. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate, as the amendment proposes, to confer them with Civil Service status and conditions.The Deputy appears to be concerned about the standard of behaviour and accountability of such persons and has sought that they be appointed as officers of the Minister. He is concerned that different codes of conduct will apply as members work side by side on an investigation. I assure the Deputy there are a number of provisions which will ensure that team members working on an investigation will be subject to standards of behaviour and a level of accountability.Section 6(5) provides that such persons will be subject to such terms and conditions as the Minister may determine in the context of this Bill. Section 7(1) provides that where a joint investigation team, or part of it, is operating in the State, it will perform its functions in accordance with the law of the State. Team members will also operate under the control and general superintendence of the commissioner who will make the necessary organisational arrangements for it, including appointment of a team leader.Section 7(2) provides that the team leader will manage the operations of the team in accordance with the Act. Team members will perform their functions under the direction and control of the team leader. Persons appointed to a team, who are not members of the public service, would, in all likelihood, only be required on a part-time basis for a short period to provide expertise on a particular aspect of the investigation, for example, as a computer expert. It would not make sense, as the Deputy proposes, to make such a person an officer of the Minister. If this was to happen, a contract of employment would have to be negotiated. Provision would have to be made for issues such as pay, tenure, hours of attendance, annual leave, sick leave and superannuation. Such terms would have to be considered having regard to possible equivalent grades in the civil or public service. This process could prove time consuming and would only serve to delay the investigation and prosecution of cross-Border crime which goes against the thrust of the Bill.For the reasons outlined I do not propose to accept the amendment.

At the end of the day he has not adequately addressed the issue of accountability. While it is highly unlikely that those who would be taken into an investigation team would indulge in any kind of improper behaviour, there is no accountability for these people. While it is unlikely they would act in an improper or illegal fashion, is there anything the Minister can say that would satisfy that concern?

In page 12, to delete lines 34 to 37.The purpose of this amendment is to narrow the scope of the Bill to co-operation in joint investigation teams with members of police forces of other EU member states and officers of other EU institutions, such as Europol and Eurojust only as specified in paragraphs (a) and (c). Paragraph (d) allows for police and other officers, designated by any third state outside the EU by ministerial order. While I would not rule out the possibility of co-operating with police forces outside the EU in a joint investigation team, the nature of Ireland’s relationship with non-EU states is not the same as other countries within the EU. Therefore, it is not appropriate that we treat the police forces of other non-EU states in the same manner.For example, the Bill is silent on the civil liability issue with respect to officers of non-member states. It is ambiguous with respect to the criminal liability of officers of non-member states. For example, are they covered by section 12(b) and, if not, what are the implications? Does it mean they cannot be held accountable by a Garda ombudsman, as we would prefer, or a Garda ombudsman commission, as the Minister of State would have it? What will happen in the event of misconduct by members or officers of non-EU member state forces? Will the sharing and use of information provisions in section 11 also apply to authorities of non-member states? So far as I can see, the Bill is silent on these issues. There is ambiguity. As I understand it, the Bill would allow for members of the Israeli security forces to operate in a joint investigation team with the Garda on Irish soil investigating members of the Irish Palestinian population, if there was such a call. If, in the course of that investigation, there was serious misconduct by the Israeli security force members resulting in injury, death or other damage or loss, how would it be dealt with? Would the offending members of the Israeli security force be held accountable for their actions in this State? If the Garda Síochána is to co-operate in joint investigation teams with non-EU states, I would prefer that it be dealt with by different legislation. This Bill provides for joint investigation teams from European Union member states. To involve non-EU countries in the investigation teams is a separate issue with potentially serious ramifications for human rights.The majority of EU member states comply with human rights procedures and records. While there are abuses, which I listed and Amnesty International has a long list, the same is not true of countries outside the EU which are not bound by various EU directives on human rights compliance. We should not extend the legislation beyond the boundaries of the European Union.

He raised a number of important issues on joint investigation teams and the police forces in member states. The reality is that not all police forces instil public confidence, for example, the record of the British police in carrying out investigations in the North and policing generally. Serious international incidents have arisen in the past ten to 15 years, especially in Northern Ireland where there were question marks on the links between some elements of the police force with paramilitaries, particularly loyalist paramilitaries. Many have reservations about the way the Pat Finucane case was handled, for example, and the connection between the police, the so-called security forces and the people directly involved in that death. The security services in France were involved in the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior. We should demand vigilance and professional investigations from non-EU states, as well as from the EU member states.I support the point made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh on the Israeli police. I would not have great confidence in them and the Israeli security services based on their past activities, especially on policing and investigation.These are proper issues to raise. We accept that most member states are moving in the right direction on respect for the human rights of citizens in the European Union, but some are still a long way behind and must get their act together. I strongly support this amendment.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	423	Section 9(1)(d) provides that participants in joint investigation teams can be drawn from authorities of countries or territories other than member states of the European Union, which have been designated by the Minister. The effect of the proposed amendment would be that the competent authorities would not have the option of seeking assistance from states outside the EU when in certain circumstances, special advice or expertise may be required for an investigation. I admire the two Deputies for coming up with the example of the Israeli police. I would not expect such a situation to arise, but perhaps it could and it is important that we would be able to cover it.Article 1.12 of the framework decision provides as follows:To the extent of the laws of the Member States concerned or the provisions of any legal instrument applicable between them permit, arrangements may be agreed for persons other than representatives of the competent authorities of the Member States setting up the joint investigation team to take part in the activities of the team.The framework decision on which this Bill is based has been taken from the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. Paragraph 12 of the explanatory memorandum of that convention states that this provision paves the way for member states which have established the joint investigation team to agree that persons who are not representatives of their competent authorities can take part in the activities of the team. What the drafters of the convention had in mind was that additional assistance and expertise could be provided to a joint investigation team by appropriate persons from the states or international organisations. This will allow a degree of flexibility in the formation of teams and permit additional assistance and expertise to be provided by appropriate persons from other states.While I know that in the majority of cases, the necessary expertise will be found among the members of the various police forces, and EU bodies such as Interpol or Eurojust, I expect there will be occasions when a joint investigation team may be established which will require something over and above the necessary expertise available in that context. A possible example of an investigation that would require assistance from a state other than one of the member states would be an investigation into the trafficking of females for sexual exploitation purposes where it is known that its origins are outside the EU. In such a case, it may be necessary to seek assistance from an appropriate person or authority from that country. Such a person, if required, would be likely to be appointed on a once-off basis and may only be involved in a particular aspect for a certain period of the investigation.We are obliged to maintain this provision to meet the criteria set out in Article 1.12 of the framework decision. The provision will mean there is no bar to proceeding with a criminal investigation which has cross-border links, which is the purpose of the Bill. I remind the Deputies that foreign police operating here will not be leading teams, which will be lead by a Garda Síochána of the rank of superintendent and will be in support of the Garda in the investigations. For these reasons, I reject the amendments.

What we are dealing with is one of the measures under the EU anti-terrorism roadmap. The legislation is restrictive in how we can amend or adopt it, but I do not think we cannot place restrictions. That is one of the restrictions and the Minister of State has already rejected the other restrictions. We should set a target that we have the best possible police force and the best possible systems adopted by the police force and that anybody working with it should comply with them. In this instance, I do not believe that those who would operate in Ireland under the Garda Síochána could be held liable because the liability issue does not apply to members from non-EU countries.There is and there will be joint operations between the Garda Síochána and the FBI or the Mexican police force, for example, all of which can be dealt with if we initiate other legislation which sets out the parameters for those joint investigations. This Bill is supposed to deal specifically with the European Union and events and issues which are cross-jurisdictional or affect the European Union as a whole. It is not meant to apply to global joint investigation teams, which it seems to be by the way it is worded, especially in the section I am trying to delete which extends the remit of joint investigations well beyond that for which they were originally intended. The Minister of State should think again.

I was a member of the Oireachtas sub-committee on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Many people did not bother to co-operate with the sub-committee, which I found very offensive, and we sought submissions. I found it offensive that a former Taoiseach did not wish to appear before the committee and make a submission. The first citizen of Dublin, the Lord Mayor spoke to the media on the subject of the bombing. He did not have the courtesy to respond, even when Mr. Justice Barron wrote to him. I do not blame the police forces or other people. There is an onus and responsibility on us all to be good citizens and to live up to certain standards where joint investigations teams are concerned.On the positive side, some people came in from England and America and one former British soldier, Colin Wallace, made an excellent detailed submission, with no axe to grind and treated our sub-committee with great respect. His superiors, however, such as Paul Murphy, did not have the courtesy to do that. It is important that we examine the real issues in this respect. We must have co-operation, quality policing, police forces that respect human rights and police forces and investigation teams which the citizens respect.

In page 13, line 41, after "2004” to insert the following:", or(d) in such other circumstances as may be determined by the Commissioner with the consent of the Minister”.This amendment seeks to amend section 10 which deals with amendments of the Garda Síochána Act 1989. The Bill reads:The Garda Síochána Act 1989 is amended:(a) in section 3 by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (2) (inserted by section 5 (a) of the Europol Act 1997):"(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Acts, a member of the Garda Síochána to whom this section for the time being applies shall be liable to serve outside the State ...(c) as a member of a joint investigation team within the meaning of the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004.”.The Labour Party amendment seeks to add the words:", or(d) in such other circumstances as may be determined by the Commissioner with the consent of the Minister”.The amendment was raised in the Seanad where the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, said that section 3(2) of the Garda Síochána Act 1989 does not exhaustively list the circumstances in which a garda may serve outside the State. On that basis he rejected an amendment which would have applied the disciplinary regulations to gardaí serving abroad under the section. It seems inappropriate to have a non-statutory regime for gardaí abroad side by side with a statutory regime. Accordingly, we suggest a mechanism to bring other existing missions abroad into the ambit of the Garda Síochána Act. What arises is that some gardaí may serve overseas under a statutory regime and others under a non-statutory regime.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	428	This matter was raised on Committee Stage when it was indicated that the proposed amendment was not a runner. The same arguments still apply in rejecting the amendment. Deputy O'Shea intends to amend the Garda Síochána Act 1989 so that all circumstances under which gardaí serve abroad are covered by statute rather than informal arrangements. The purpose of this Bill is to enable effect to be given in Irish law to the EU Council framework decision on joint investigation teams. Accordingly, the Bill as drafted amends the Garda Síochána Act 1989 to add membership of joint investigation teams to the range of activities for which members of the Garda Síochána are liable to serve outside the State. It would not be appropriate to include a catch-all provision for all assignments abroad along the lines proposed in the amendment by Deputy O'Shea in this Bill. The scope of the Deputy's amendment is too broad for this Bill.There is a provision in section 44 of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the other House, which will address the Deputy's concern. Section 44 of that Bill provides for the assignment of members of the Garda Síochána on international service and reflects the nature and scope of Garda overseas service which has grown over the past 15 years. Section 44(1) provides that the assignment of eligible members to perform duties of a police character with an international organisation such as the UN is a matter for the Government whereas the Garda Commissioner may assign eligible members to perform liaison duties and other overseas duties as is provided for in section 44 (2). Such assignments include liaison duties with Europol or, subject to the agreement of the Government, with a law enforcement agency of a state other than the State or with international organisations. I cannot therefore accept the Deputy's amendment.

In page 14, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:"11.—For the avoidance of doubt the disciplinary regulations for the time being in force applying to members of the Garda Síochána shall apply to service by a member whether within or outside the State.".We are still on section 10 of the Bill which deals with amendments to the Garda Síochána Act and we seek to introduce a new section 11. The amendment is self-explanatory and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.

These issues were raised on Committee Stage and during the passage of the Bill through the other House. The points made in response to the amendments at that time still apply. Amendment No. 13 proposes to provide that the Garda Síochána discipline regulations of 1989 will apply to members of the Garda Síochána within or outside the State. This is already the case. Discipline of members of the Garda Síochána under the 1989 regulations is not bound by geographical limits. An explicit statement in this Bill that the 1989 disciplinary regulations apply in the context of this Bill could give rise to the suggestion that they might not apply where they are not specified in other legislation. On Committee Stage I gave the example of there being no provision in the Europol Act 1997 to the effect that members of the Garda Síochána assigned to serve abroad with Europol will be subject to the disciplinary regulations whether within or outside the State. The amendment is unnecessary and undesirable for the reasons outlined. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept it.I will discuss amendment No. 15 if that is agreed.

The amendment deals with breaches of discipline by seconded members operating in the State, that is, team members from another member state involved in establishing the team which is operating in the State. It proposes that where such a breach of discipline takes place, the matter will be investigated by the Commissioner who shall report to the relevant competent authority of appointment. The proposed amendment is somewhat similar to section 6 of the Garda Síochána (Police Co-operation) Act 2003 which provides for procedures for breaches of discipline by a member of the PSNI who is seconded to the Garda Síochána.There is, however, a significant difference between members of the PSNI being seconded to the Garda Síochána and members from other EU states being seconded to joint teams operating in the State. Where a member of the PSNI is assigned to the Garda Síochána, he or she becomes a member of the force and will be treated as such in all respects, whereas a member of a foreign police force who is seconded to a joint team operating in the State will remain in the employment of the foreign state which appointed him or her. He or she will act under the direction or control of the team leader for the duration of the joint investigation. Such officers will, however, continue to be subject to their home authority's disciplinary rules.There is little to be gained from making a specific legislative provision for the Garda Commissioner to report to the competent authority in another state on alleged breaches of discipline when it is not within the remit of the Commissioner to follow up on the issue in any manner or when the competent authority in another state is not bound in any manner to take action on foot of any such report. If the seconded member commits any breach in the State which is criminal in nature, he or she, in the same way as would a member of the Garda Síochána, will be criminally liable here under section 12 of the Bill. The State will also be liable, in accordance with section 13, for any injury, loss or damage caused by seconded members in the performance of their duties as a member of a joint team in the State.It would not be prudent to put in place detailed legislative provisions to report on alleged breaches of discipline which, in all probability, are unlikely to arise to any great extent, if at all. Matters such as this are best left to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. They can be provided for, in a tailor-made fashion, in each agreement establishing a joint investigation team to suit the particular investigation which will have persons from different countries subject to different rules and procedures.While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	435	By and large, the Minister of State's comments have allayed some of my concerns regarding gardaí not being subject to the same disciplinary procedures inside or outside the State and what will happen when a member of an investigation team within the State who hails from outside the State, is guilty of a crime. As I understand it, the Minister of State indicated that such a person would be liable to the criminal law like anyone else within the State.There is an issue of communication involved here. Even though I am not aware of anything in the legislation which provides for it, I take it that where suspicions arose about an officer from a police force outside the State, such suspicions would be the subject of an investigation by the Garda authorities. Is there any obligation on the Commissioner to make that known to the competent authority within the other member state?

I expect that if there are suspicions about or an investigation into the behaviour of a foreign member of a team, details of such suspicions or investigations would be relayed to and taken up with his superiors in his home country.

In page 14, to delete lines 41 to 43.The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that all the information lawfully obtained in this State by a member or a seconded member of a joint investigation team can only be made available to and used by the authorities in another member state for legitimate purposes outlined in sections 11(1)(a), (b) and (c). These paragraphs state:(a) the purposes for which the joint investigation team was established,(b) subject to subsection (2), the detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences other than those in respect of which the team was established if the prior consent of the Member State where such information became available has been obtained,(c) the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to public security in one of the Member States concerned and only if the Member State where such information became available has been informed of such use and, without prejudice to paragraph (b), a criminal investigation is conducted subsequently ...These are the circumstances in which it would be reasonable, responsible and in the public interest to share information. Sinn Féin accepts this and for that reason we regard the formulation used in paragraphs (a) to (c) to be sufficient. However, the scope of paragraph (d) is extremely wide in that it allows information to be shared for any other purposes agreed between the competent authority here and those in other member states. This is far too broad in that it would allow the sharing of intelligence for its own sake in circumstances where there is no criminal investigation and no immediate public threat.I cannot agree that this is necessary for public safety. Sinn Féin believes it potentially goes against the public good and the right to privacy. We are, therefore, trying to narrow the scope of section 11(1) by removing paragraph (d). This would not damage the idea behind the Bill. In the long term, it would be in the interests of the public if the amendment was accepted. It would also help to focus the activities of investigation teams to a greater degree in that they would not have this broad scope available to them in the background when they are in this country obtaining information or investigating some matter.

This provision is intended to reflect the provision in Article 1.10(d) of the framework decision which provides for the use of information for other purposes to the extent that it is agreed between member states setting up a team. The Bill provides for the use of such information for such other purposes within the scope of the legislation as are agreed between the competent authorities. It provides a tighter drafting of the provision than that contained in the framework decision.As the provision the Deputy is seeking to delete is specifically provided for in the framework decision, I cannot agree to its deletion from the Bill. For that reason, I must reject the amendment.

I do not believe we should accept what is contained in the framework decision in every instance. The framework decision requires that we should adopt legislation which would give effect to the major part of that decision. In this instance, even if the provision is tighter I do not believe it should be included in the legislation. The ability to extend matters, in terms of information and intelligence gathering, beyond the provisions contained in paragraphs (a) to (c) should not be available, particularly in light of the fact that joint investigation teams can be made up not only of police officers but also of members of intelligence agencies within Europe.My request is reasonable and it does not limit the scope of investigations. We should ensure that, to the greatest degree possible, legislation is specific. This provision is not specific. It uses the term "such other purposes" and is open, wide-ranging and not in the public interest.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I wish to take up on three of the issues I raised yesterday. The purpose of this Bill is to give the ESB the power to raise further funding for infrastructure. I urge the Minister to ensure that infrastructure in isolated areas, where people are entitled to the same quality of power as everybody else, is covered. I compliment the ESB, particularly in north Mayo, Achill and similar places, on its investment in areas where there was a power cut every time there was a storm. It has spent money and put much needed infrastructure in place, on which I compliment it.I raised the matter of the closure of Bellacorick power station in north Mayo. I urge the Minister to ask the ESB and Bord na Móna to stop destroying the bogs until the feasibility study on the project private individuals want to put in place there is completed. That project would create jobs and save the power station. A plan is in place and I urge the Minister and his Department to examine it before making any decision. Bord na Móna and the ESB employ many people in the power station, yet they are talking about closing it this year or early next year. The ESB is working out a redundancy package for its staff but the people would prefer to have jobs and be working. I hope the Department will examine the proposed project. I urge the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to examine it and provide an opportunity for it to proceed before the bogs are destroyed. The project should be examined by the State agencies, the ESB and the Department. The State and Europe already subsidise jobs in the midlands so why can they not do the same in the west?Each county council has now been given directions on wind farms. People want to invest and become involved in this new modern industry. The major problem facing them is the planning process. There is no doubt that due to the size of the structures required for wind farms, something must be done with the planning process. Every county development plan should be clear and each council should have a policy as to where wind farms will be acceptable and will not destroy local amenities or the beauty of an area. They should certainly be located away from people's homes. People must be protected because they were living in areas before it was proposed to locate wind farms there. However, if those farms can provide alternative and cleaner energy and can improve electricity supply, they should be considered. We must put proper planning in place so that we do not end up, as has happened in my county, with eyesores all over the place. In some areas the farms are fine, but in other places they are not. County councils must have a clear policy on the issue.I was disappointed that after making substantial profits in the past two years, the ESB could not see fit to retain its shops in many places, especially in my town and county.It could not see fit to keep people employed in these towns. They could not see fit, when many people were using their hire purchase schemes for electrical goods, to keep these shops open. The ESB currently employs contract workers brought in from England while getting rid of its own staff particularly in rural and isolated areas. I am opposed to this policy. I ask the Minister to ensure the ESB has the necessary staff in place, particularly in isolated and rural areas, so they are on hand in the case of a breakdown. To be fair to the ESB when emergencies occur in winter during bad weather, it has responded well and restored power promptly, for which I compliment it on a good job.I wish to inform the Government that small businesses are sick and tired of stealth taxes. They are sick and tired of all the new charges and sick and tired of organisations like the ESB increasing charges when it wishes to raise some collateral. Such bodies go to the regulator and are given approval for a price increase. Both small and big businesses are finding it very difficult at present. They find it difficult to compete with the rest of the world and particularly with the rest of Europe. An increase of 5% or 7% might mean the difference between keeping people employed in small industries. Many small businesses do not receive any grant aid or support from the State yet any increase in charges takes away from the profits and denies the opportunity for investment in the business.I know small business people who work not 38 hours a week but 38 hours a weekend and who are making a very poor living. They are the easy target and the easy touch. I welcome the big international companies who set up in this country. They employ people and that is good for the country. They are given grant aid from IDA Ireland and the Government and they receive tax breaks and are charged corporation tax at 12%. They have no difficulty being competitive. It is the small guy in the small area who is not able to handle these increases any longer. Last year the ESB applied for and was granted price increases on three occasions. The regulator had a job to do to make the market competitive. The market needs competition. The taxpayers helped set up the ESB and provided the resources and the money.The ESB should have a social conscience particularly in respect of rural, isolated areas and for businesses in those areas. It has an obligation to provide a service for the people who need it most. If that was the attitude of Iarnród Éireann, there would be no rail service in the west of Ireland. The taxpayer has rescued all the semi-State companies from trouble in the past. The ESB must now provide the services for rural areas that may not have the same capacity as cities. Everyone is entitled to have the same quality of service whether they live in cities or in a rural area.I have no problem with the ESB raising funding for infrastructure. I hope in the future it will not run back to the regulator. The person paying the interest on the borrowings will be the ordinary consumer with a small ESB bill. Those people will pick up the tab for the foreign investments.The ESB bought a generator which was stored for years in a European country and was then sold at a loss. I ask the Minister to deal with that matter in his response. I will be happy to supply the Department with any further information it requires on that matter.The Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, is in the House. I hope the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, will examine the project in Bellacorrick power station. Jobs can be created there. I ask the Government and the State agencies to give it a chance and to at least investigate whether it is a viable project. I ask that it be independently verified. We must stop breaking up the bogs until that decision is made. The peat is there. The information supplied by the ESB to Bord na Móna is not correct. There is enough peat there to keep Bellacorrick power station open for the next 25 years. What is needed now is the political will and the political commitment to keep jobs, infrastructure and power in the west of Ireland. Bellacorick has served its purpose in the past and I estimate there are another ten or 15 years left in it. The commitment was given to close down a number of power stations and to substitute them with two in the midlands in Deputy Cowen's constituency, and also to get subsidies from Europe and the Irish taxpayer. These subsidies and the infrastructure should be spread around. Bellacorrick should be kept open if at all possible. If the ESB is determined to close it, the alternative proposals made by private enterprise should be considered. If a project is viable, it should be supported by the State agencies. If it is not viable, I do not have a problem with that. However, it must be given a chance.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I echo those Deputies who have indicated their support for this Bill. An increase in the borrowing limit available to the ESB is obviously necessary at this point and my Sinn Féin colleagues will be voting in support of the legislation. Along with other Deputies, however, I have a number of other major concerns regarding the current state of the company to which I will briefly refer.The first of these has to do with the fact that while the ESB has had increased levels of profits over the past number of years, it has also imposed quite substantial increases on household consumers. While it is obviously good that a State enterprise is able to generate such profits and thereby disprove the theory that State companies are by definition always inefficient, this ought not to be at the expense of the consumer. As a State company, the ESB's domestic customers are in effect shareholders. Unlike the shareholders in private companies, however, they do not receive dividends although I am aware that the company has paid a dividend to the State which benefits us all if channelled into necessary public expenditure.However, it should also be the case that the customers of the ESB should benefit more directly through not having to pay increased electricity bills. This is particularly important for the many people on low incomes who find it increasingly difficult to meet their bills.This leads me to another issue in my constituency which the company and the Minister ought to investigate. A supermarket has a meter machine where consumers purchase tokens for their electricity meters. The machine is situated in an off-licence. I have contacted the ESB which informed me there are no guidelines for the location of these machines. I have written to the manager of the store and to the store's head office asking them to relocate the machine. Given that those who have a meter are people most likely to have had a difficulty paying bills in the past, this can often present a significant temptation for customers with alcohol-related problems. It is understandable that some find it impossible to resist. Instead of buying units of electricity, many are buying units of alcohol.Members of Alcoholics Anonymous have asked me to help. Many of the customers are attending rehabilitation. I appeal to the Minister to use his influence with the ESB to ensure that meter machines are not placed in such obviously unsuitable locations. It appears that the machine is deliberately located at that counter. I may be hard on the management of the store but it seems that no thought was put into the location of the machine. Guidelines for the location of these machines are clearly required when they are placed in such obviously unsuitable locations.Another issue which has arisen regarding meters is that the vast majority of the 20,000 meters have not been adjusted to take into account recent increases in charges. This means people who pay for electricity through a meter are accumulating debts. The reason for setting up the meter system was to facilitate people who were having difficulty paying their electricity bills. Now that the ESB has woken up to the fact that it has not adjusted meters, it will leave people owing money. I know of one case of a person who owes approximately €400, which is unacceptable. There have been many cases of people discovering they owe money. This can have a disturbing effect on those who have been struggling for years to pay bills and believed the meter system had overcome the problem, only to find themselves in debt again. People are asking what is the point.The ESB should ensure meters are updated as a matter of urgency. A case can also be made that those whose meters have not been adjusted to register the increases should not be required to pay debts accrued through no fault of their own. The fault lies with the company and if it has awoken to the fact that it failed to pass on increased charges, vulnerable people should not be made to pay, particularly in light of its substantial profits. If the Minister has any influence, he should use it in this case. As I stated, the reason most of the 20,000 people affected use the meter system is that they experienced difficulties with payment in the past.I was glad to note the Minister indicated opposition to the privatisation of the ESB. There should be no question of privatising the company. It is unfortunate that the Minister's defence of a successful State company is not shared by some of his Cabinet colleagues who appear to be intent on supporting vested interests in privatising other parts of the State sector.On the issue of the ESB's finances, I draw attention to the fact that workers in the company are currently seeking wage increases. In common with other State employees, they believe they have been inadequately rewarded in recent years and that the current financial health of the company provides scope for reasonable increases.I am disappointed the ESB does not have a substantial plan or proposals to invest as part of its funding package in eradicating the heavy duty masts associated with health concerns. The sterile lands in which the masts are located would be of considerable benefit to communities and should be developed for their use. Like me, most Deputies will be aware of such masts in their local areas. In my case, the lands on which masts are located in Kilnamanagh would be of significant benefit if developed for the local community.On a more positive note, my party supports the ongoing involvement of the ESB in the development of an all-Ireland energy policy. To approach the provision of electricity and gas on that basis clearly makes political and economic sense. There are bound to be economies of scale involved which should lower the costs of providing these services to the benefit of consumers throughout the country.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	449	From this debate and media reports, we are all keenly aware of the magnitude of the challenges facing the ESB. The company's current infrastructure investment programme is immense by any standards. I welcome this Bill which raises the ESB's borrowing limits to €6 billion, an increase that reflects the practical work the country's largest semi-State company must undertake to maintain and progress the modern economy.One of the ESB's primary concerns is the development of the national network infrastructure on which it is spending in excess of €3 billion. We must have the capacity to develop industry in the west and I welcome the fact that the company is addressing the infrastructure deficit clearly evident in the west. It is long overdue and should be accelerated.Although this is a small country, the level of work facing the ESB in renewing its network is vast. For example, the transmission system covers 2,500 km., the high voltage system runs to over 10,000 km., the medium voltage system covers 76,000 km., and the low voltage system is 60,000 km long. The scale of investment in infrastructure, some of which has been in place for 70 years, will be substantial. Given the growth of the economy, the increase in private housing and the peripherality of the regions, the ESB must have the cash and capacity needed to provide equality of service across the country.The ESB serves 1.7 million customers and its new business is increasing at a staggering rate. I understand it installed 77,000 new customer connections last year alone, with approximately 80,000 new connections likely in 2004. This clearly indicates the scale of economic growth in the small business sector, about which I have considerable knowledge, and in connections to new houses, of which I noted a large number while canvassing in recent weeks.Electricity is a multi-billion industry which is opening up to competition. With deregulation imminent, the necessary investment in infrastructure must proceed. This is particularly important in light of the circumstances surrounding the privatisation of Eircom, which is now unwilling to invest in the regions because it does not believe it is justified on the basis of return on investment. The ESB must, therefore, give a solid commitment on investment before deregulation proceeds and new entrants join the electricity sector. Investment is as important as competition.The fact that the ESB will acquire a further 80,000 customers this year is an indication of the scale of its business and the profitability of the sector. It is important, however, given the remoteness of some connections, that parity applies as regards charges.I am informed that the networks division of the ESB erects 500 poles each day at a daily cost of €3.5 million. While people may comment on the charging policy of the company, to which I will return, it is important to note the scale of development this semi-State body is undertaking.In addition to responsibility for developing the network system, the company is responsible for the electricity generation business and for developing and modernising its portfolio of power plants. Six of its old peat-fired power stations have closed or are in the process of closing and will be replaced by two top of the range peat-fired power plants in Lanesboro and Shannonbridge, respectively. The new plants will burn the same amount of peat as the old stations but much more efficiently. While all closures are contentious and can be politically charged, businesses must operate in a competitive market. The benefits of these changes should be reflected in the company's efficiency and charges.We live in a competitive economy in an enlarged Europe and new companies will enter the electricity market. As the Minister will be aware, job creation is a factor of companies' stacked up costs. If we are to attract investment, our charges must be among the lowest in the world. Modernisation and investment should ensure we have low electricity charges, a key driver of economy growth.Our wage costs are high compared with the ten new EU member states. Ireland should have the capacity to attract new industry and it is equally important that the ESB's investment of €3.5 million daily to address the infrastructure deficit will pay dividends. Power stations should be efficiently run resulting in reduced charges. The ESB wants to close a number of power stations and open two new peat stations. The onus is on the company to state why this is happening. Who will benefit? For example, will this move only benefit the ESB's bottom line and increase its profitability? The consumer must also benefit as should businesses which create jobs.The ESB faces immense challenges, including the opening up fully of the electricity market next February. From that date all customers will be able to choose their own supplier and a number of companies have entered the market in competition with the ESB, including Viridian, Bord Gáis and Airtricity. The ESB should have a business plan and it should outline what it contemplates doing to address the infrastructural deficit. The company should give an assurance it will not back-track on the plan and it will meet its commitment. It has stated the high voltage system should cover more than 10,000 km, the medium voltage system should cover 76,000 km and the low voltage system should cover 60,000 km. Parts of the current system are of a low standard.Significant changes are taking place in electricity generation, particularly in Europe. The EU triggered a programme of liberalisation in the industry and the ESB must work towards a totally competitive market. The ESB is ahead of itself in regard to its obligations under the EU directive on market liberalisation. I work in an industry where the customer is king and value for money is important. Transparency in the market is also important and a cartel should not develop among the new entrants to the electricity market. For example, people are still looking for competition in the telecommunications industry. There should be no ambiguity regarding how the industry will operate from next February.The ESB is fully supportive of the development of an all-island market. There is a trend across Europe towards regionalisation of the electricity market and the company has positioned itself accordingly. It is developing a power plant in Northern Ireland and this cross-Border dimension to the company's business is important. The development of an open economy in the Republic is also essential when it comes to electricity charges.I am glad Ireland is committed to the reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions from the current level by 2010. The ESB has presented a proposal to Government to develop emissions control technology at Moneypoint so that the plant can remain in operation in the long term. The plant is of major importance in terms of production. It produces more than 20% of the country's electricity. A decision on the Moneypoint proposal will be made shortly and I hope the outcome will be positive for Ireland both economically and environmentally. I welcome the agreement of a best practice arrangement with workers at the plant on this important issue.All these changes cost money. The ESB raised $1 million through a private placement in the US earlier this year. The company's borrowing will increase to almost €4 billion by 2008. However, it was a vote of confidence in the company that it could raise such an amount in the US. Its portfolio is good, it has 1.7 million customers on its books, a figure which is increasing by 80,000 annually and it made a profit of €250 million last year. It is important that the company should be competitive but it was granted a significant price increase of 14% recently. This was extraordinary and I hope the Minister will be slow to grant a similar increase in future. The increase has a significant impact on consumers and small businesses.The ESB's closure of one third of its shops was another blow to rural Ireland on the part of a semi-State company. However, small businesses have been successful in the cut-throat retail sector. Brown and white goods are sold at tight margins and people do not appreciate how fine is the profit margin in this market. It has reduced to5%. The ESB has deemed the market unprofitable but small retailers who get little or no support are still expected to supply these goods.Banks and post offices have also closed in rural Ireland and it has been suggested recently that Garda stations should close. The ESB should consider a partnership arrangement with small investors in towns where it has closed its shops. The ESB could offer an opportunity to business people who may have a good site to take on a tenancy with the backing of the company instead of closing its shops. This issue has not been examined and I hope the Minister will consider it.Businesses face increased costs. Manufacturing industries, in particular, must cope with increased insurance, telecommunications and labour costs. High utility charges in Ireland act as a major disincentive for many companies to their continued operation in the State. Electricity and other energy sources are a key cost component for many manufacturing operations. The Government is content to allow electricity costs to spiral upwards oblivious to the consequences of such increases for hard-pressed businesses.Deregulation of the electricity market is supposed to reduce costs and enhance choice but instead we have witnessed annual increases in energy costs for businesses and few new electricity generators. We have been presented with a farcical scenario where we have been told energy costs must be increased to encourage more competition in the sector. I hope that is not the case. One would assume that more competition would reduce costs, but I hope a cartel does not develop, with more competition leading to increased costs.It appears we are levelling the playing pitch before new entrants come into the market in February and it is important to put down a clear marker for a semi-State company which is receiving a massive investment. That investment is welcome but the customer should not end up paying for this. Our economy faces huge challenges in an enlarged Europe, including Poland and other countries, with people entering this country, while there are also stealth taxes on rent, rates, telephones and electricity. There is no control whatsoever and the Government has totally disregarded its responsibilities to the backbone of the economy, small businesses.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	490	This Bill seeks to raise the statutory borrowing limit from IR£1.6 billion to €6 billion. It is being pressed by the Government as an urgent project and while I have no desire to curtail the necessary activities of An Bord Soláthar Leictreachais, I have a lot of reservations about the Bill because of the current situation and the way in which the ESB is obliged to get funding in the world's financial markets.The history of the ESB is a magnificent story in many ways. Over the decades tens of thousands of ESB workers supplied our society with a modern energy system. I remember the huge extension of electricity during the 1950s into my native area of west Kerry. I remember clearly the tilly lamp and lantern, on which we were entirely dependent, and our amazement when electric light was invented. I remember the equivalent of the migrant workers who came to dig holes for ESB poles, all of which gave us the modern facility we still have today. It was of course a State initiative. Capitalism as it had developed in Ireland, in a largely Fianna Fáil-dominated State, was entirely incapable of providing this necessary infrastructure. It is instructive to remind ourselves, in this great rush towards privatisation of our public services and deregulation, that the State, on behalf of the taxpayers and the people, had to come into the field to provide us with a nationwide electricity grid.We see clearly how democratic socialism would work and will work in the future when it comes to the mobilisation of existing resources for the benefit of society. The Minister is part and parcel of the privatisation agenda and he can smirk and deride the idea now, but he should reflect on the history of the State. A series of critical services, not just electricity supply, had to be developed by public funding because such capitalists who existed were entirely incapable of doing so. They had neither the resources nor the know-how.Taking that lesson forward into the future, many Third World countries cannot find electricity or clean water to drink at present. Mobilising their resources in a planned, public way would quickly resolve many of those problems. However, the whole thrust of Governments, including the Irish Government, is towards allowing the cartels of multinational corporations etc. to have a stranglehold on the provision of these services for super profits.My reservation with regard to providing this large borrowing capacity is that the history of the semi-State sector over the past 30 years is that it has been used as a cash cow for major banks and financial institutions which have made massive fortunes from the levels of interest on borrowings which they have taken from the semi-State sector. A few years ago I had occasion to highlight in this House the example of the absolutely scandalous case of Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta whose borrowings in the 1980s and 1990s gave rise to a situation where, if I remember correctly, the interest paid hugely exceeded the principal borrowed at a certain stage in the late 1970s or in the early 1980s.I notice from looking at the annual accounts of the ESB for recent years that there is a situation which should have been commented on by the Minister when he made his introductory remarks. For example, in 2000, the total interest payable by the ESB on borrowings was €49.9 million; in 2001, it was €45.1 million; in 2002, it was €46.8 million; and in 2003, it was €62.1. In four short years, a total of €204 million was paid in interest alone by an entity which is owned by the taxpayer. The Minister should have dwelt on why we have a situation where a semi-State company such as the ESB is allowed to be dependent to such a degree on private financial institutions when the result of that is a huge bleeding of resources out of the company which could otherwise be utilised in further investment, particularly looking forward, in investment in alternative energy and in alternative means of generating energy which will be critical for the future.The Minister did not refer to the interest payment implications if the ESB finds it necessary to go up to its €6 billion limit which he proposes. It is completely unacceptable that a publicly owned entity, owned by the taxpayer, is held to ransom by the major financial institutions, whether nationally or internationally owned, as the case may be. The massive amount of interest paid every year, both in the national debt and in the more hidden repayments by our semi-State and publicly owned companies, makes a powerful case that the banks and financial institutions should be in public ownership so that we do not have this massive bleeding of our funds to further bloat the profits of international financial institutions.The €204 million used to pay interest over the past four years alone could have been invaluable in the further investment and research and development possible in the generation of electricity. It is clear that the agenda of the Government is to move in the direction of privatisation of our electricity supply company further down the line.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I have seen the Minister's statements in that regard, but it is scarcely 48 hours since the Tánaiste lectured us in general terms that the Government was not moving fast enough on the implementation of radical policies. I have no doubt that the speeding up of the privatisation of our public services is one of the policies——

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I am sure that at a certain stage, whether the Minister is incumbent, just as our telecommunications sector was privatised and is now the plaything of multinational and international financiers scamming, profiteering and speculating on what is a crucial national resource for our people, a Government of the philosophy of this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats one will move in the same direction as far as our electricity generating industry is concerned.Admittedly, the Government, after the shock delivered to it on 11 June, is somewhat like a beached whale. While we all would have sympathy with a beached whale, we would not have such sympathy with the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, especially when the Progressive Democrats tail has been thrashing around vigorously in the past 48 hours. I accept that Ministers from the Fianna Fáil element of the Government will perhaps be a little more cautious, although it remains to be seen. The little humble pie the Taoiseach has eaten and seems to have digested and the fact that he is moving on to business as usual should not give us great confidence that the neo-liberal agenda being pursued by the Government will be slowed down considerably. In any case, privatisation is one of the options but one which should be resisted.In regard to electricity generation for the future, it is an area on which we should have a much more urgent discussion. Undoubtedly, with the population of this State having risen to close to 4 million and with continuing and extensive demands on electricity, there will be an increased demand for electricity generation. The means and methods of that generation raise many serious questions such as the amount of investment needed and the environmental implications. We have been moving in the direction of closing down generators which were damaging environmentally. Everyone wants to put in place a generating capacity which will have the minimal possible impact on the environment. Obviously, the generation of electricity by wind and wave is a controversial matter that must be discussed.Undoubtedly there are difficult questions concerning striking a proper balance between what is necessary and the environmental and visual impact of electricity generation systems in scenic areas, their noise impact on local communities where that arises, etc. These are not easy questions. The use of gas in the generation of electricity needs to be studied. That brings into sharp relief the incredible scandal of the Government giving the entire Corrib gas field off the west coast lock, stock and barrel to a multinational gas and oil corporation on incredibly favourable tax terms with no royalties being claimed.The putting in place of the electricity generating capacity in this State done by way of the mobilisation of public resources stands in stark contrast to how our gas resources have been given lock, stock and barrel by a Fianna Fáil-dominated Government, which continues to be the case, to a multinational oil company. The short-sightedness and crassness of that decision beggars belief when we will need the mobilisation of these resources into the future. They properly belong to the people and should have been maintained in their ownership.Some 8,000 plus workers in the ESB have a tremendous record of dedication to the production of a crucial resource for us all. Their expertise and interest in this crucial public company must be utilised much more. The workers must be brought to the heart of the management of this semi-State company, as should the workers in other semi-State companies, to ensure that their commitment and expertise can be utilised fully as this company goes on.Those workers must also be properly rewarded. This company is very profitable and it is therefore outrageous that increases in electricity costs for ordinary householders — one of the many stealth taxes over which the Government has stood in recent years — are being implemented and will place an added burden on many low-income families. That is deplorable in light of the buoyancy of the profits of the ESB. That company is in public ownership and it should operate from a public and social perspective with regard to how its services are delivered and the impact of the prices it charges. Regrettably that was not done with regard to the ESB's shops, but it should have been done. Many of the same principles that apply to An Post also apply to this company. It is not acceptable that a publicly owned company can operate in the same way as some private banks which have treated rural communities with great disdain and cynicism by closing local branches when apparently they have not contributed enough to the substantial profits these banking organisations make.There are many questions regarding the borrowing policy of our semi-State companies that the Government does not want to examine. There should have been a projection forward as to the amounts the take-up of borrowing would entail. As I outlined before the Minister of State came to the House, the semi-State companies have been a cash cow for many financial institutions over the past 30 years. It is not good enough for the Minister to present us with a one-paragraph Bill stating that the possibility of borrowing is to be increased to €6 billion without outlining to us the cost implications of that, especially in terms of interest paid, which is a major drain on the resources of this company, as I outlined.Dá bhrí sin, maidir leis an mBille do leasú alt 4 den Acht Leictreachais (Soláthar) (Leasú) 1954 agus do dhéanamh socrú i dtaobh nithe comhghaolmhara, ba cheart don Rialtas agus don Aire go speisialta teacht chun cinn chun an t-eolas a chur ós comhair na Dála maidir leis an chostas a bhainfeadh leis an saghas seo airgid a bheadh á thógaint ar iasacht ag an Bhord Soláthair Leictreachais.

#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	495	While this Bill is necessary to ensure the ESB has sufficient funds to carry out its functions, that it is now urgent shows to a large extent that our overall energy policy is being mismanaged by the Government in the same way as many other major infrastructural projects. Ireland's electricity industry had a sound historical record of providing the country with reliable and reasonably priced power. However, with no political leadership or vision, this has changed dramatically in the past five years. Ireland has no energy policy and this Bill confirms that. Ireland's political failure to modernise the electricity system in a fair, open and forward-thinking way is a recipe for disaster.We have an energy crisis and the Minister does not even realise the enormity of the problem facing this country. All that is happening in terms of this Bill is that the ESB is setting the Irish energy agenda and the Government is rubber-stamping that decision. The economy consumes an average of 180,000 barrels of oil every day. This is only 2% of the world's daily consumption of some 80 million barrels. However, our small share belies the fact that our economy is unusually dependent on oil compared with other developed countries.In recent years, our consumption of oil has risen by 1.8% for every 1% GDP growth. This is three times the EU average of 0.6%. Ireland's annual oil consumption is set to rise from nine billion to 13 billion tonnes per annum by 2010. Oil dependent countries, such as ours, are more vulnerable to price increases than other EU countries. If we follow this pattern, a $10 per barrel oil price increase will reduce growth rates by 1% or more. That means that the increase in oil prices over the past 12 months could cost the economy €1 billion next year, and that is only if prices remain at their current levels.Like the rest of the eurozone, Ireland is currently protected to a certain extent by the low value of the US dollar, so we do not feel the full effect of recent price rises. We have no protection from unforeseen events, such as another terrorist attack or another upheaval in the Middle East. The imminent peak in world oil production has serious implications for Ireland whose transportation and food production sectors, as well as power generation and industrial production, are almost entirely dependent on oil.The Government should realise just how vulnerable our energy security and economic prosperity are. There is only one way oil prices will go at this point, and that is upwards. We have had numerous debates in the House about renewable energy, including Ireland's unique position to produce wind energy. The Minister has set targets which were ignored by the ESB. By now we should be producing up to 2,000 megawatts of wind energy, whereas we are only producing 200 megawatts. The ESB tells us, now and then, that in certain circumstances wind energy and other renewables will be too expensive, yet some of our European neighbours are producing up to 23% of their energy requirements from wind. Because of the lack of Government policy, the ESB will likely try to replace oil generation with gas generation, which will start our dependency cycle all over again.The amount of natural gas is also limited. The countries that produce the most gas are those most capable of dramatically improving their economic performances in the coming decade — countries like China and Russia which will use their own gas resources to give impetus to their economic growth.We need a comprehensive energy policy immediately, in addition to a portfolio of energy options carefully balanced to provide security of supply and some price stability. Energy security is fundamental to our economic growth, of which price stability is an essential element. As a matter or urgency we need to maximise our energy output from renewables, particularly wind energy. In the context of national security, the Minister must publish an energy policy and must prioritise renewables within that policy. He must realise that he and his Government colleagues have responsibility for overall policy. For far too long, however, the Minister has allowed the ESB to dictate such policy. There are various competing interests within the ESB, including those for and against privatisation. Whatever side we may come down on, the Minister's job is to ensure stable energy supplies at reasonable cost.There is no doubt that the Minister has failed to liberalise the energy generation sector and to encourage competition with new players generating energy. On the other hand, the lack of a comprehensive policy, particularly for renewables, may mean that the current upgrading of the grid may not be the most appropriate or effective approach. The ESB's current market share of all generating assets is between 85% and 90%. The ESB continues to own and maintain the entire grid system, which should remain in public ownership. We do not want another Telecom fiasco whereby individuals make millions from infrastructure that was paid for by taxpayers and is then allowed to fall into disrepair. Public ownership of the grid is in the national interest but the more players involved in generation, the better value there will be for consumers.Other issues need to be tackled, including planning, but the Minister does not seem to be in charge in this respect. He has assured the House that the introduction of SPAs would not prevent the building of wind turbines. Last week, however, An Bord Pleanála overturned a decision by Cork County Council, which had granted permission for 21 wind turbines. We are facing into an energy crisis but a body established by the Minister is ignoring the national interest and Government policy. An Bord Pleanála can point to the fact, however, that the Government does not have an energy policy and that a ministerial assurance to this House does not constitute such a policy. We are facing a national energy crisis and the best the Minister can do is introduce a Bill authorising the ESB to borrow and spend more money, with no policy guidelines to fulfil and no value for money audit. That is typical of the way the Government is mismanaging infrastructural projects in the economy.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I welcome the Bill, whose provisions will increase the borrowing capacity of the ESB. I join other speakers in referring to the cost of energy in this country. Last year, IBEC's small business association carried out a survey which revealed that one of the major problems facing Irish businesses is the cost of energy. The survey labelled the 12 major problems facing Irish business as "the dirty dozen". The cost of energy was ranked fifth on the list of major problems facing industry. Some 7.1% of respondents to the survey said it was the number one difficulty, while 72% of those surveyed said it was a major problem for the business sector. They pointed out also that in the preceding 18 months energy costs had risen by 21%, which is a crippling blow for many businesses, especially in the small firms sector.When it was proposed recently that the ESB would increase its prices by 10%, the Minister said he would not accept it. The small industry association repeated its concern about such a proposed increase and stated that if the 10% rise was permitted it would represent an increase of 40% over the last four years. Energy costs should be kept at a competitive level. The current price of oil is giving rise to much concern and if it continues to escalate it will have major implications for energy costs here.Added to the other hidden costs, it makes it difficult for small industries to survive and is making us less competitive. As other Deputies stated, deregulation and competition in the electricity market were supposed to help to reduce costs and enhance choice, but this has not been the case to date. I look forward to there being more operators in the market and greater competition in order for prices to stabilise.I welcome the major investment by ESB Networks in Kerry North in the past three years which, by the end of this year, will represent a total of €17 million for the entire county. The capital investment has provided major employment for many people, including 65 ESB network staff and 165 contractors, and has also supported local suppliers. It is a welcome investment which has benefited County Kerry before other parts of the country. Given that the county is a peripheral one, it is important we have an up-to-date efficient network if we are to attract industry.The work carried out in Kerry has considerably increased the efficiency of the network. For example, during recent high winds, I noticed that the same breakdown problems did not occur and elected representatives did not receive complaints because the network had been improved. The pre-existing network dated back to the 1950s and the time had come to renew it. The ESB must be supported financially if it is to re-invest in the network and, without this facilitating Bill, it would not be able to do so.The efficient Oireachtas Library staff recently accessed for me a contribution I made in the Seanad on the Air Pollution Act 1987 about Moneypoint power station. I referred then to the need to invest in scrubbers at the plant but the ESB stated it could not make the investment because of the cost, indicating that the proper de-sulphurisation equipment for the plant would cost approximately £145 million. The figure was disputed by a German expert from one of the largest manufacturers of de-sulphurisation equipment in Europe who argued that it would cost approximately £40 million to install the equipment.Unfortunately, since then Moneypoint has been a source of pollution, even though it had licences. Notwithstanding that, it must have had an effect on our environment and that of our neighbours because it increased by about 70,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide the amount of pollution in the atmosphere. At that time it doubled the level which was being discharged into the atmosphere. However, since then the plant has been recognised as having high environmental standards and has enjoyed a strong environmental record.The current integrated pollution control licence issued by the Environmental Protection Agency requires that emissions to the air of sulphur dioxide and monoxides of nitrogen be reduced from their current levels by 2008. For Moneypoint to achieve the required emission levels, air emissions control equipment will have to be installed in all three boilers, requiring a major investment by the ESB of the order of €250 million. The installation will enable the station to meet emission limits and operate beyond 2008.I am glad to report that agreement was reached between staff and management at Moneypoint to begin the process to ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency licence can be granted. The ESB announced that a decision to accept the deal on cost restructuring and best international practice was reached on Monday. I welcome the decision and the fact that there is now a commitment to install the proper equipment to reduce the emissions and ensure the continuance of Moneypoint into the future because, not alone is it one of our biggest providers of energy, it is also a major employer in west Clare and north Kerry. If anything happened to Moneypoint, it would have a major effect on our energy output and on employment in the region.In regard to a point made by Deputy Murphy, counties Clare and Kerry and the western seaboard have a great capacity to produce wind energy. Unfortunately, the policy being pursued by the Government is not encouraging for private operators, many of whom have planning permission but cannot compete with the more international players to get involved in the production of electricity. Although the Minister is not present, he should seriously examine the attractiveness of wind energy to co-operative groups such as farmers who could produce and sell electricity into the national grid. However, it is not working out at the moment.We do not have the same planning problems in Kerry as have been experienced in Cork recently. Moreover, Kerry has a wind energy policy and a huge area in the north of the county has been designated as being suitable for turbines. However, there is no point in having an area designated and applying for planning permission unless it is attractive to people to become involved in erecting turbines and producing electricity. It is critical that the issue of wind energy is examined seriously. It should be reviewed and made more attractive to co-operative groups, not just companies. It is potentially a great source of income for the farming community and landowners along the western seaboard. I urge the officials to ask the Minister to address those issues when he replies to the Second Stage debate.

#DennisODonovan	unknown-#DennisODonovan-party	unknown-#DennisODonovan-dob	unknown-#DennisODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	498	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion. It is important to note the Government's commitment to the Garda in terms of numbers, financial resources, training and the provision of equipment in recent years. Since 1997 there has been a 75% increase on the then €600 million available to the Minister in that budget to over €1 billion. It would be remiss of me not to mention the significant progress made by the Garda in combating organised crime, particularly drug barons, the importation of drugs and dealing in drugs. During the past 24 to 48 hours the Garda was successful in making a number of arrests and seizing almost €3 million worth of illegal drugs which affected people from the Cork and Dublin networks in the procurement of drugs. I laud in the highest possible terms the Garda on its tremendous success in this area.Last week, in my constituency, significant interceptions of illicit drugs, whether E tablets cocaine, marijuana or other prohibited substances have been made. We always hear about the cases where this or that failed, but the Garda, through its training and discipline, has made inroads into the area of drugs and drug trafficking during the past decade. This is attributed to Government policy, continued financial support, training and international co-operation between the Garda forces and so on.Ten or 15 years ago, the island of Ireland was the gateway for some of the major drug trafficking from Colombia and north Africa. Bales of drugs dropped off at sea came into inlets in west Cork and the west of Ireland. Most of these drugs were not for use in the Irish market but in Great Britain or continental Europe. The efforts of the Government and the Garda Síochána in this area have been tremendous. This type of policing is never-ending. Unfortunately today, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe and the developed world, the drugs trade is one of the blights on society. Even though the Garda has done tremendous work in this area, particularly during the past five or six years, its efforts must continue.I laud the Minister on the increasing number of Garda on our streets and in towns throughout the country and his commitment to providing a force of 14,000. I compliment him on the advances made in Garda technology and in providing state-of-the-art Garda stations and equipment throughout the country. I acknowledge all the criminal legislation initiated not only by the Minister but by the previous Government.Having commenced my contribution with a reference to the whole area of drugs, I am concerned that legislation introduced by the previous Government specified clearly and unequivocally that anybody dealing in drugs and the supply of drugs to a value of €10,000 or more should get a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. I was a Member of the other House when that legislation was going through. I regret that measure has not been implemented across the board. Without breaking the separation of powers, I suggest the Judiciary revisit that issue. If a mandatory sentence is imposed, whether for drink driving, where one is put off the road for two years, or having no insurance, and one gets months, I cannot understand why the other arm of the State has constantly ignored it with regard to drug trafficking and drug dealing. It is a shameful exercise given that one of the greatest problems in society is drugs. That point should be noted.Another problem in all our towns and villages is street disorder and drunkenness. We must acknowledge we live in an affluent society. A study of Greek history, pre-Roman, the Stoics and the sophists will show that the Stoics was a wealthy society which said, "Eat well, be rich and be merry and enjoy life". We have something similar today. Young people have money and there is much disorder in society. The Minister cannot be blamed if some people, not necessarily young people, have too many drinks in a pub or disco and a brawl develops. Street disorder is a problem, and I am pleased to note the Minister has committed greater resources to deal with that difficulty.I acknowledge the tremendous work being done by the Garda Síochána and particularly its courage in the past 24 hours in the chase, and constant surveillance in recent weeks, of people involved in drugs importation and distribution. I wish the three gardaí who were injured in this escapade a speedy recovery. The bravery and courage of the gardaí in the course of duty must be acknowledged unanimously by every Member.One would like to envisage a society with no crime and no problems, as envisaged by some of the architects of the Russian socialist regime which had the thesis, synthesis and antithesis, meaning that there would be no crime in society, there would be no need for laws or police officers and we would all be happy, but unfortunately that regime broke down. Some Members would have us believe the process envisaged by Lenin, Trotsky and others during the Russian revolution could be achieved here, but it will never be achieved.The previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had a view of zero tolerance, but we must realise there will always be crime, vandalism and theft, as human nature will never change. One must on an ongoing basis review procedures, resources and so on. In spite of all the criticisms, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a clear commitment to improving the powers of the Garda Síochána through legislation, providing additional financial resources and a better working environment and improving their training and providing them with state-of-the-art facilities. It would be more effective to establish an agency to monitor and process traffic control measures, such as speed cameras and so on. It is wrong to have the Garda Síochána doing secretarial work, because the gardaí should be on the streets.I support the amendment. As agreed, I will hand over to my good friend from Tallaght, Deputy O'Connor, with whom I am sharing time.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I am almost reluctant to take over from Deputy O'Donovan because of the flow of his fine speech. I share the views he expressed. I too pay tribute to the Garda Síochána because it is fitting to do so on this occasion. I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is easy in the rough and tumble of politics to take all sorts of stands, but I am a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and I have the opportunity to support the work he is doing on behalf of all of us.Early this morning, we dealt with the Estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I took the opportunity to raise some of the subjects we are dealing with now. I certainly welcome the Estimate and the increase in manpower and financial resources for the Garda Síochána. It is very important that we continue to support the work of the Garda Síochána, the courts, the probation service and allied services, which form part of the justice brief. It is important to have an effective response to crime, and my colleague Deputy O'Donovan referred to that. Whether one is in west Cork, Clare, Donegal or in a major population centre such as Tallaght, the problems are the same. People bring us the same message, they want Deputies to continue to fight for resources for the Garda Síochána and to ensure they continue to be available. It is important that we understand the need to protect our communities at all stages. When I was a small boy my grandmother used to tell me that what concerned her were not the bank robbers robbing banks in America — I am not suggesting that my grandmother was pro-crime — but the people who were terrorising and robbing people in the Dublin of her day. That logic prevails again today.When one listens to debates on crime or to the problems in the community , the same problems keep cropping up, with communities suffering from anti-social behaviour, under-age drinking and public order offences arising from drink. It is the same all over the country and it is important the Minister understands the need to respond to that. People in the community believe that the Garda Síochána should be available on the streets and working with the communities. People often ask why so few gardaí are on the beat but are doing administrative work in stations or are in the courts. I am not suggesting the gardaí should abandon the courts, but surely in this day and age there must be a better system where gardaí are relieved of these types of duties where possible. The gardaí should be in the communities dealing with the problems and working with the people, not only when there are problems but at other times, working in partnership with other organisations and working with young peopleI did not intend to talk about Tallaght, but the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera reminds me that when she represented Tallaght a few years ago, it was different. Today, Tallaght is the third major population centre in the country. It has a significant youth population. I represent Dublin South-West and we have only one Garda station, in Tallaght, for the whole constituency. Garda management say that is the best way of organising their resources. I continue to make strong representations not only to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but to his colleague in the Office of Public Works, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, about the redevelopment of the Tallaght Garda station site because it is important. I am glad that with my prompting good progress has been made in that regard and I look forward to the day soon when we will have a fully modern Garda station in Tallaght which, with such a big population, deserves it.Given that Tallaght has the biggest and best shopping centre in the country in the Square, Tallaght Hospital, the institute of technology, council buildings, the county library and the national basketball arena, there is now much more demand on Garda time and resources than was the case. It is fair that I make the point, while supporting the Minister's work, which I do as a member of the committee, that more gardaí are needed in Tallaght. Unfair comparisons are often made with other population centres, particularly Limerick. I will not be a cry baby, but I want the Minister to continue to pay special attention to the Garda needs of Tallaght. We are well served by the gardaí but they are often very stretched. It is important that we support the Minister in his efforts to allocate more gardaí to Tallaght.A number of gardaí have died in Tallaght. Garda Tony Tighe who was killed on the Stillorgan Road a number of years ago lived on the Belgard Road. Five years ago, Sergeant Andrew Callanan was killed on duty in Tallaght Garda station in a terrible fire. In February 1982, Garda Patrick Reynolds, from Kilmacthomas, County Sligo, was killed on duty in Tallaght. I pay tribute to the Garda Síochána who serve in Tallaght and, as a public representative, I continue to support their work in a very strong way. Tallaght deserves more gardaí and, while I am happy to support other colleagues——

Debating issues such as this can give the Garda Síochána the sense that they are undervalued and it is important to respect the role it plays in an ever-changing society. I often wonder why the Opposition gets its best inspiration and ideas while in opposition.

Just approaching two years in office the Minister has faced many challenges and introduced wide and varied legislation. For example, the Minister took over management of his Department in 2002 and piloted the Intoxicating Liquor Act through the Oireachtas in 2003. There has been a steep and continuing drop in the number of public order offences, with a 21% drop in assaults last year and 18% to date this year. I do not understand how this motion can state that there is increasing public concern. Is the Opposition saying that the public is concerned at the continuing reduction in public order offences? While fully acknowledging that we all have concerns about any level of public order offences, the public is relieved to have a Minister who, when he sees a problem, solves it.There is no doubt that the Garda Síochána is in need of reform, and the Government is initiating that. There is a need for extra gardaí and I support the policy and commitment to achieve a force strength of 14,000 members as outlined in the programme for Government. I welcome the Minister's statement last night to the effect that he intends that the additional 1,800 gardaí recruited to reach that target will be recruited at a rate of 600 per annum from 2005 onwards. Manpower levels are being decided along the lines of an outdated role for the gardaí. That role has changed since the 1950s to include the additional duties of community policing, specialist criminal squads working with the CAB, anti-racism work, immigration units, sexual assault units, drug units, overseas duties with Europol, subversion and crowd and traffic control, all of which dilute the number of gardaí available for the streets.The recently published SMI implementation steering group report has laid the groundwork for a newly structured force to meet the many challenges of a modern Garda force relative to today's society. This report will provide the basis for the Garda Síochána when the recently passed Garda Síochána Bill is enacted.The objective of closing Garda stations as outlined in the report for the Dublin metropolitan area is the correct one. What is applicable in Dublin where many Garda stations can pool resources after normal hours does not necessarily apply in rural Ireland where I come from. A system of access to gardaí must reflect the difference between urban and rural society. The objective must be more gardaí on the streets rather than manning telephones and sitting in offices doing other work that is not of a policing nature. I welcome the fact that the Minister has allowed for the establishment of a Garda reserve force which will give greater flexibility to, and further enhance the provision of, full-time gardaí on the streets as circumstances demand. I also welcome in the report a more proactive approach to community policing, with clearer and more defined roles, functions and management practices. It is the key to the good and preventative policing needed in society.The Garda Síochána is the linchpin in our democracy and its foundation. It must be organised, resourced and staffed to ensure it is positively effective. The proposed reforms set the framework for that new force but it must be funded. I am confident the Minister will receive the support of the Minister for Finance in providing the necessary funding, not only for an increase in Garda establishment but also for the necessary resources to equip, recognise and reorganise the gardaí in accordance with the SMI report.Reference was made to the rise in public order offences, to which the Minister responded. The best way to combat public order offences, most of which are alcohol related, is by personal responsibility. There seems to be a new and increasing perception that Government is responsible for everything and we as individual citizens have no responsibility. If all sections of society paid greater attention to their personal responsibilities to their families and the communities in which they live, this would be the strongest challenge to the increased level of public order offences in recent years. I welcome the fact that local authorities have been given power under the Intoxicating Liquor Act to decide policy on closing hours, and as a former member of a local authority I hope they will exercise that power effectively and take responsibility at that level. I am happy to commend and support the amendment.

Communities have the right to be consulted and they should have been informed of what was happening in the run-up to the elections. Now that the elections are over the Minister should begin a proper consultation process with communities, and not just place an obscure advertisement in the local papers inviting submissions. We should ensure that communities have a say in the shape of policing structures and organisations and how or when the local Garda station is to be closed or amalgamated.The Garda station in my area was downgraded, about which we raised many concerns, to be told that there would be no reduction in policing in the area. While the station is nice and modern there has been a reduction in the resources available to the area. There is no longer a superintendent in the station and the first call for resources at night, if there is a public order offence or an incident in the divisional area, is the area closest to the station or the headquarters in Ronanstown, which seems to get priority. There has been a reduction in the number of vehicles available to the gardaí in the Dublin South-Central area and the nearby Dublin West area. A major concern is the lack of resources in an area where crime and drugs problems and anti-social behaviour are worst, whereas there is a greater concentration of resources in areas which are not deprived and do not have the same crime levels. The issue of resources available to the Garda Síochána needs to be addressed.I recognise that the Government has allocated more money to the Garda Síochána than ever before. However, if such money is not directed properly it will be wasted and existing problems in deprived areas and areas hardest hit by violence and anti-social crime will continue to be exacerbated.As stated earlier, there must be proper consultation. The Minister, the Garda Commissioner and the assistant commissioner must involve themselves in this process. They must not just listen, they must take on board what members of the public have to say. They must engage in one to one meetings with members of the public because that is the only way the Garda will be accountable to the public. When we have managed to amend the Garda Síochána Bill in this House it will ensure that proper structures are put in place to allow members of the community to play their role in those structures, in directing where resources should be deployed and in influencing how gardaí interact with the community.When the Minister requested them, Sinn Féin made a submission, Policing for the People -Building Safe Communities — Rebuilding Public Confidence, which has since been published. People in many communities in Dublin and elsewhere have lost confidence in the police force. Such confidence can be quickly rebuilt. I encourage the Minister, in the context of the Garda Síochána Bill, to consider our proposals and those of others to ensure that we have the best possible policing service in the world and that Ireland will set the trend for everywhere else. That cannot happen unless we take on board what people are saying and unless we redirect resources to where they are required rather than to where the Minister believes they are required. The people know best in this instance because they are suffering on a daily basis.I welcome the SMI report and I hope we will be able to make a realistic appraisal of Garda stations and the need for them to operate, in some instances, on a full-time basis and, in others, on a part-time basis. We must ensure that communities understand why decisions in this regard are being taken.

I recognise that the Garda Síochána does an excellent job with the resources, however limited they may be, at its disposal. In the programme for Government dating back to the most recent general election, the Government parties gave a commitment that an additional 2,000 gardaí would be recruited. People generally believe promises and they thought those gardaí would be recruited on foot of the pledge given in the programme for Government. They voted for and supported the Government parties on the basis of that belief and returned them to power. However, they now feel let down by the fact that the extra gardaí have not been recruited. There is not much evidence that they will be recruited. People living alone and elderly people living in rural or urban areas are afraid to open their front doors. Security is a major issue for them.I found it difficult to comprehend that, on one hand, the Government promised 2,000 extra gardaí would be recruited while, on the other, the Minister for Finance stated that a cap would have to be imposed on the number of people employed in the public service. Effectively, conflicting messages were being sent out and this created a state of confusion.Many towns in Border areas have a reduced need for a high level Garda presence. We welcome the fact that there is no longer a need for 27 gardaí to be stationed at Emyvale. However, I cannot welcome the fact that there are no gardaí at all in many towns in areas along the Border. Emyvale used to have three sergeants and 27 gardaí, whereas now the office in the town only opens between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. The position in Clones, which used to have a large garda presence, is similar and the office there also opens between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. The station in Scotstown only opens for a few hours each morning. There is no way an area can be policed when these type of opening hours for Garda stations are in operation. The argument has been made that Garda stations are not being closed and that the number of hours they are open is merely being reduced. However, this is similar to the argument that accident and emergency departments are not being closed and that only the hours in which they provide services to the public are being reduced.Gardaí are losing touch with the people as a result of this development. That is a key point. Gardaí cannot maintain contact with people or know what is happening if they are merely sent to stations for a few hours each day to write reports or whatever. In such circumstances, gardaí do not mix with communities and are not part thereof and, as a result, they cannot be trusted by members of those communities. Trust is built up over a period and it is being lost. We should give serious consideration to this matter.The other issue relating to Border areas is that many criminal gangs are aware that the Garda presence in many towns has been greatly diminished. In a new development, gangs are crossing the Border from Northern Ireland and they appear to know which towns, villages and houses to hit. They are benefiting from the fact that Garda stations have been removed from these areas and from the fact that police numbers on the opposite side of the Border have been greatly reduced. The Garda Síochána does not have the manpower or patrols to intercept these gangs. The gardaí may know the people for whom they are looking or have quite a good profile of them but they are powerless unless they catch these individuals in the act or in possession of the proceeds of crime.Much of the time we place the onus for policing on the Garda. However, people should engage in patrolling or policing in their communities. There are many signs throughout the country which declare the existence of neighbourhood watch schemes. However, that is often as far as it goes. Neighbours should be more watchful and should be more aware of strange vehicles or individuals in their areas. There is an onus on people, if they are suspicious about someone, to contact their local Garda station. More often than not, gardaí will know whether individuals fit the profile of those they want to apprehend. A neighbourhood watch sign will not do the work and cameras are not erected alongside such signs. There is nothing to beat good old neighbourly suspiciousness. I am not stating that people should be intrusive or nosy but they should certainly care for their neighbours, particularly those who are elderly. People should accept responsibility, to some extent, for policing their own communities. They should be more vigilant.The criminal gangs to which I refer appear to know the days on which pensions and children's allowances are paid and who collects those payments. They also seem to know the day on which creamery cheques arrive. These gangs appear to have carried out massive research into what happens in their areas and they know who to target. If they are discovered in suspicious circumstances, they often come up with silly excuses for their presence.We need a Garda traffic corps. The soaring number of deaths on our roads is a major problem. Rather than sitting behind signposts with speed detection devices, gardaí should be out patrolling minor roads.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion which relates to the Garda Síochána and the justice system in general. It is important to acknowledge that many people and communities feel the justice system has let them down. We must face that fact and respond to it. A classic example is the current hunger strike by a constituent of mine, Mr. Peter Preston, at the Kildare Street gate during the past ten days. Mr. Preston's daughter was savagely attacked in a pub and received 24 stitches in her face. However, when the case came to court justice was not done and was not seen to be done because the individual responsible for the attack received only a suspended sentence and a small fine. This is an example of one of the many cases where people feel let down by our justice system. We have to face the fact that whole communities are being intimidated and taken over by drug barons and other areas are being infected with major anti-social problems.I raise these issues in the debate because the Government and senior management in the Garda Síochána are not responsive. Not enough is being done to assist working class people. The Garda force must have the respect of the community and the way to get respect is to go out and earn it. Quality policing must be community based, people centred, well resourced and committed to human rights. That is the way forward.I am fed up listening to the tired major political parties constantly putting down Independent Deputies and councillors who are progressive people who put forward constructive and practical proposals to resolve problems. We have radical new policies and I wish people in power would listen to us. We have concrete proposals to develop the Garda Síochána. I have already made many submissions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this regard. It is wrong to say we are against everything. The Government should open its eyes and ears to our sensible ideas on policing. Closing Garda stations and making the Garda more remote from people is a daft idea. Each Garda station should be like the village shop or the local community centre — open to serve people 24 hours a day, seven days a week.We need more gardaí out there mixing with people and preventing crime, but we also need efficient and professional teams to deal with the drugs crisis in society. That is why I support the motion before the House. We cannot have a situation where elderly people are locking their doors with bolts and chains each night at 7 p.m. because of fear and intimidation. A society that allows this to happen is losing its heart and going nowhere. In these changing times we need more quality gardaí who are well trained. We also need professionalism and efficiency in senior Garda management. The Garda Síochána should be non-political and non-sectarian.Last year, €20 million worth of drugs was confiscated in my constituency by the Garda Síochána and the drugs squad. We have to face up to the reality of the drugs trade. Just because people in certain areas are not engaging in gangland warfare and shooting each other does not mean the problem does not exist. In another part of my constituency, 278 people were charged with drug-related offences. There is a crisis in parts of Dublin and elsewhere in the country and we must face this reality.I challenge Deputy O'Connor — who I regret is not present — on Garda numbers. The Garda station in Coolock is currently down five community gardaí. Up to six more community gardaí are required for the area to have a quality service.We also have the scandal of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform claiming he is on top of crime when we have gangland murders in the city, yet nobody appears to care. Addicts are dying on our streets but because they are poor working class people, nobody appears to care. These are the issues we must tackle. The Garda Síochána and communities must be part of the plan. We must help drug addicts and get rid of pushers. We must also face up to the increase in the sale of cocaine throughout the country. It is going into every community in the city, not just poor and disadvantaged areas. We must wake up to this problem.I request the Government to implement the programme for Government and increase the number of Garda by 2,000. It should also reconsider the closure of Garda stations, which should never be an option. I urge Deputies to support the motion.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	515	Gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaithe as ucht a gcuid ama a roinnt liom. Tá an Comhaontas Glas ag tacú leis an rún seo agus tá gá mór leis.It is important particularly to bring a sense of reality to the debate regarding the people I represent in Dublin North when we read the Government response to the motion that is peppered with words like "welcomes", "congratulates" and "commends" the Government. Deputy Finian McGrath referred to Coolock being down five community gardaí. Coolock station is part of the Dublin metropolitan region to which Swords and Malahide also belong. It is important to bear in mind the low morale evident among gardaí, certainly in the Dublin region. It is important the Government notes this because it is not just a matter of addressing structural issues; it is a matter of resources. That low morale is due to increased violence, anti-social behaviour, intimidation and general dysfunctional behaviour in communities which too often are intimidated by a small group of people. Gardaí are in the front line and a number of them have said to me they are too old to get kicked about. They are taking any opportunity they can to retire before their time, particularly in view of the Government's intention to increase the age of retirement. This is exacerbating the issue of resources.A death has given rise to another vacancy among the Garda in Balbriggan. Overall, in the Balbriggan district, which is in my area, Garda numbers are down by nine due to retirement, transfers and the death to which I referred. The population in this area has risen from 10,000 to 36,000 due to the level of rezoning, in addition to the effects of the spatial strategy on the population.Even if things were standing still, we would be faced with a lack of resources for the Garda Síochána, but they are not. In Rush there are now two gardaí and one sergeant where 12 months ago there were four gardaí and one sergeant. One has been transferred and one has retired. In Lusk there are three gardaí and one sergeant who have to cope with all the demands of Oberstown and Trinity House which includes escort duty to courts and travel all around the country from that small station based in a village which is expanding at an enormous rate. New houses are being occupied every day in that area. Skerries is not at full strength either due to injury and other reasons. Garristown is another area depending on two gardaí and one sergeant. If one were to go back to 1979 or even back to 1988, one would see greater resources than we have today, although the population is soaring in this area. The Government has lost touch with the reality of the needs in this area and the needs have also grown.A special drugs unit is in existence since 2000 because of the increased problem with drugs. In my area, the need for that drugs unit is palpable. Before that, the Special Branch dealt with drugs related crime and subversives. The needs are increasing all the time and the Government has lost touch with reality. The Garda is put in an invidious position. One garda in a squad car who comes across a fairly angry and perhaps even drunken crowd cannot call for back up. Gardaí are expected to put their lives and certainly their health on the line. The Government has to answer for the positions in which they are putting many members of the Garda Síochána. In addition they have to face parents who come down to the station to demand the return of drink which had been taken from under age children. Gardaí are caught in the pincer movement of irresponsible parents in some cases and lack of resources to deal with the situations they face.The Minister is ironically creating a climate for vigilantism. Because of the limitations on Garda resources he is, in effect, outsourcing community policing to unaccountable private individuals who are outside the law. Some people find that satisfactory but it is not satisfactory to me or the Green Party. We need resources to support the neighbourhood watch schemes, the Balbriggan awareness of drugs schemes, the parent-to-parent courses and all the people who are trying to address the issue on a voluntary basis and who need support along with the Garda Síochána. The Government is falling down in its responsibility. It has broken its promise to the people at the last election.

The incidence of rape of women has increased by 29%, of section 4 rape by 16%, of aggravated sexual assault by 200% and of burglaries by 6% in the first three months of this year. The number of robberies of cash and goods in transit has risen by 53% and the discharge of firearms has also risen by the same figure. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not on this planet when he says the figures indicate crime levels have decreased. Some 25,572 incidents took place in the first quarter of 2004. Within that figure minor crime reduced marginally but serious crime increased dramatically.Another area of concern is the administration of bail, which is a shambles. The Bail Act 1997 provides that people arrested and remanded on bail who subsequently fail to present themselves to the court forfeit the bail lodged. It also requires the Courts Service to collect any balance unpaid. This has failed. In 2001 a total of 6,250 bench warrants relating to the period 1998 to 2001 were outstanding, representing 21% of all bench warrants issued. My information is that the corresponding figures for 2003 are higher. Crime pays in many instances because the bail on which people are remanded and which they forfeit is often never collected even though they can pay it. In 2001, the Courts Service computer system recorded €638,125 as the amount forfeited due to breach of bail conditions. However, only €20,000 was collected and paid over to the Garda.In 2002-03 unexecuted bench warrants increased at an annual rate of about one quarter of the number issued, yet the Minister says we are dealing with crime. What about the victims of crime? Unexecuted bench warrants mean people are never brought into court. If they are and pay some amount such as €500 to the judge, they get away without paying the remainder or ever being brought back to court. How can the Minister stand over that?In the past six years, 103 reports have been submitted by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This is an indictment of the Minister's inability to deal with the issue, especially at a time when Garda stations are being closed. Not only that, the Courts Service has failed and the administration of bail is a shambles. In condoning this rise in crime where people are brought to court, get out on bail and pay no more, the Minister is saying that crime pays. The figures can be audited and checked. I want the Minister to explain to the House how he can stand over this level of crime and the shambles of the bail system. It is a joke that people can go to court and get away without paying the full bail and that there are so many unexecuted warrants.The figures for the first quarter of 2004 say it all. There is an increase of 53% in the discharge of firearms and also in the incidence of robberies of cash or goods in transit. The situation is so bad that the business community does not report crimes to the Garda because it feels it is a waste of time to do so. That is how bad the situation is. Those of us on the Committee of Public Accounts know how inaccurate these statistics and figures can be. The figures are only part of what has been recorded. What are the unrecorded figures? They would be five times these figures in the first quarter of 2004.This is a serious issue in every town, village and community. It is outrageous to hear the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, sermonising about the closure of Garda stations because these provide the only sense of security in a community. What will happen with people's security systems that are linked to Garda stations? This is part of the Eircom service, but how much does the State get from Eircom for the service which promotes security watch in private homes and which rings through to the local Garda station? Will it now ring to a voicemail in a Garda station? Is that the sort of security the State will provide?Robberies from private homes and businesses occur at a daily rate of 360 in small villages and rural areas. These robberies are carried out by gangs from cities who come to the towns and villages and rob petrol stations and small retailers. The Government has failed in its duty and judging by what I have heard from the Minister on the issue, he should resign.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	519	Where is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? I do not wish to show disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, but on an issue of this importance the Minister should be present. It is not enough that he should come in, deliver what he has to say and then buzz off. That arrogance is what is wrong with the Government and is why it got the works at last week's local and European elections. The Government is so arrogant it believes it knows everything. The Minister should be sitting opposite us during this debate. This is the national Parliament conducting a national debate on crime and the Garda Síochána. He should be present to listen.The electorate bought into the promise made before the most recent general election by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that 2,000 extra gardaí would be recruited. We cannot blame it for buying into the promise because people knew there were not enough gardaí on the beat. What the public did not know was that the Government did not have the slightest intention of appointing 2,000 extra gardaí. The Government was reacting — something it was good at until last week — to the research analysis and the private opinion polls which informed it that this was something the electorate wanted to hear. However, the Government was not in office a week when the Minister for Finance decided to place a bar on recruitment. This happened in the first week of the new Government. There was nothing the public could do about it at the time but having waited two years, the people delivered their verdict when they got the chance.One of the most important elements of a democracy such as ours is that every Member of the Oireachtas owes it to the electorate to ensure that every man, woman and child can go about their lawful business day or night without being mugged or kicked around by drunken louts who appear on the streets of every town and village, especially at weekends. This problem of offences against the person has created fear and anxiety in society.Deputy Perry was right about the crime figures. The Minister was at pains to point out decreases in the figures and there was an overall drop. However, he did not point out the figures for crimes that are not reported. Where can crimes be reported late at night? For example, a small town with a few hundred youngsters in it, the majority of whom are sane and responsible, may be infiltrated by the louts about whom I spoke, thereby giving rise to mayhem. The result is one or two gardaí in a squad car at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. trying to control 200 or 300 people. It is an unfair battle the gardaí cannot win. The reason people are afraid is that when they go out about their business, no gardaí in uniform can be seen as they would expect. Gardaí on the beat are the only visible sign that the State has the security of the people and the community at heart.I do not want to be personal about this issue. However, I have never yet seen a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with such hindsight as this Minister. The vision he has in hindsight is wonderful. When it comes down to brass necks, this Minister would do justice to a brass monkey. There is no question that this man has the answer to everything but it is not happening on the ground. There are areas of the country where if something is not done very quickly, there will be an even more hostile reaction at the next poll because this is what people want.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	520	When this Government first came to power seven years ago, a large part of its manifesto was based on law and order. For the two previous years, the then Opposition spokesmen hounded the Minister, Nora Owen, on law and order issues. Nora Owen was an excellent Minister for Justice and her performance in the Department reflected the strong stand taken by Fine Gael on law and order since the foundation of the State. Fine Gael has a strong commitment to democracy and is against terrorism. The party has always stood firmly behind the institutions of the State, particularly the Garda Síochána. The force was one of the first pillars of the State instituted by the Provisional Government in 1923. Fine Gael has given it unequivocal support with no hesitation and no secret deals to undermine its authority.For the past five years under this Government, all the talk about zero tolerance came to nothing. The Minister, DeputyJohn O'Donoghue, talked the talk but failed to live up to the expectations he had created. The nation suffered five years of failed policies, inept management and a constant increase in crime rates. People elected that Government in the hope that the young and the old could walk the streets safely and the elderly could be safe in their homes. People hoped that younger people could go out late at night without the fear of being mugged. The then Government made a deliberate effort to distort the real crime figures before the last general election. It did not release the new figures until well after the election. The reality was that after five years of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in power, the crime figures were worse than ever.All was going to change with a new Government and a new Progressive Democrats Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He was armed with manifesto commitments that would solve all our law and order problems. The Progressive Democrats manifesto stated the party would increase the strength of the Garda Síochána by 2,000 members. An Agreed Programme for Government stated the Government would complete the current expansion of the Garda Síochána and increase recruitment so that numbers would increase by a further 2,000. The electorate again bought this package. The difference on this occasion was it was being promised by the PDs and the PD watchdog as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would deliver. The irony is the Minister knew that unless there was significant expenditure on training facilities, Templemore did not have the capacity to deliver anything near 2,000 extra gardaí.Crime levels continue to rise with 20,000 more crimes committed each year and nearly 3,000 crimes committed daily. This is a clear indictment of this Minister and this Government. This is just one other area in which the Government has failed to honour its election commitments. We are now facing the prospect of the closure of Garda stations. This is from a Government that has made such a song and dance about decentralisation, once-off rural housing, while at the same time closing down Garda stations in rural areas. This Government has already collaborated with the closing of many rural post offices and rural schools and the loss of teachers in other schools. People will now be forced to live in rural isolated areas without the protection of their local Garda station.When will this Government realise that the only way to reduce crime is by having a more noticeable presence of gardaí on the streets, more gardaí on the beat, more gardaí targeting crime hot spots? Additional resources are required for both crime prevention and enforcement as well as providing special education and employment programmes for deprived communities. The watchdog Minister is doing no better than his zero tolerance predecessor.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on and support the Fine Gael Private Members' motion on the Garda Síochána. For some considerable time, the Opposition parties have been identifying and highlighting crime as one of the major issues of concern to people throughout the length and breadth of the country. As with many other issues, this Government was not prepared to listen. Instead it produced statistics to endeavour to convince the public, and more importantly and worryingly, itself, that a problem did not exist. It was given its answer during the recent canvass for the local and European elections and in the ballot box last Friday. This Government will ignore that message at its peril.The majority of people want to live and rear their families in a community that is safe and secure. People want to be able to walk the streets of our cities, towns and villages freely and without fear. Unfortunately, this is anything but the reality. Crime, including drug-related crime and anti-social behaviour, is making life miserable for too many people of all ages. As the Labour Party spokesperson on older people's issues, I am deeply concerned about the effect of crime and anti-social behaviour on older people.My constituency of Dublin North is one of the fastest growing areas in the country. The lack of Garda resources is a matter of grave concern for the people living in the growth areas of Portmarnock, Malahide and Swords, which has a population of nearly 30,000. It is of concern to those living in Donabate, Lusk, Rush, Skerries, Balbriggan and the rural areas of Fingal between the N1 and the N2. The current manning levels are more appropriate to the levels of 20 years ago when our towns were little more than villages. The current resources in terms of gardaí and cars is inadequate to cater for the daily demands of the public. Community policing where it exists, is working. However, it is non-existent within the housing estates at a time when it is needed. Prior to the general election in 2002, we were promised an extra 2,000 gardaí. Before the local elections the Taoiseach recycled that promise that 2,000 gardaí would be provided. The Minister of State is well aware of the problem, namely, that Templemore is inadequate and cannot produce the trained gardaí that are required. The Labour Party recommended and would implement the provision of a new training unit in Dublin to meet existing requirements.A new model of policing is also needed to restore the link between the gardaí and the community which has broken down in some areas. As I stated earlier, part of the solution lies in community policing based in the local estates.I fear for my constituents who have reared their children over the last 20 years. At a time when they should be enjoying themselves, they are being harassed and intimidated in their own homes by groups of young gurriers loitering outside and damaging their property and cars. I do not know how the Minister of State or Government backbenchers feel, but I feel very inadequate when constituents bring those concerns to my notice. They tell me they have been in contact with the Garda. If they are lucky, gardaí will arrive after three hours or perhaps the next day because of lack of resources. This matter is of major concern and must be dealt with.Maintaining good Garda morale is very important. The issues I want the Minister to address are the absence of performance appraisal in the Garda Síochána and the lack of transparency in the promotion system. Why should a responsible, concerned, highly qualified garda retain his or her enthusiasm for the job when promotion is not based on suitability but on what senior politician he, she or his or her family knows or whose back he or she rubs? We must remove politics from promotion in the Garda Síochána to get the right people to do the job required and the Government must implement the policies it promised but has failed to deliver.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	522	Regrettably, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is travelling to Russia this evening on Government business. As the measures he outlined in the House last night indicate, there can be no doubt of the Government's commitment to fighting crime and ensuring that the Garda Síochána has the proper resources with which to do this.The initial target of 12,000 members was achieved before the end of 2003, the highest ever strength of the Garda Síochána and this year its strength will be further increased to 12,200. The Government remains firmly committed to proceeding thereafter to increase the strength of the force to 14,000 members.On a more general issue of Garda resources, I remind the House that the Minister secured an increase in the Garda Vote for 2004 of €91 million, or 9.5%, over the 2003 Estimate of €954 million. The Garda budget is now at an historic high, having reached €1.054 billion, and the resources secured for the force constitute an increase of 75% over the figure allocated in 1997. The budget provides €7.5 million for Garda overtime to take account of the increased workload associated with our hosting of the EU Presidency and to ensure, as far as possible, that normal policing resources are not diverted during the six month Presidency period.The strategic management initiative in the Garda Síochána has been under way since 1997 and, already, important and far-reaching recommendations in the Garda SMI report on performance and accountability have been included in the Garda Síochána Bill 2004.The final report of the Garda SMI steering group, which the Minister made available to the House yesterday, deals with reform of important aspects of the organisation and structure of the Garda Síochána. The report makes recommendations on the use of Garda stations in the Dublin metropolitan region only. It proposes four different types of station based on public demand, ranging from divisional headquarters with offices, custody suites, staff facilities and a public office on a 24-hour basis, to public offices which would open for between one and eight hours per day to facilitate the various requirements of the public. The objective of reduced public opening hours is to get gardaí out from behind public counters at times when there is little demand for their services and out on the beat on the streets of the city where they are needed.Other key recommendations of the report include the restructuring of Garda headquarters and regions to ensure better emphasis on strategy, planning, evaluation and performance management, and improved processes and procedures in many other management areas.All the recommendations, each of which is important in its own respect, will fall to be considered for implementation as part of an ongoing process of Garda reform, which has already begun to deliver tangible results. As the Minister explained yesterday evening, while no decisions have been made on the recommendations, with the new measures provided for in the Garda BilI, they will provide the Garda Commissioner with a broad basis for advancing the programme of reform within the Garda Síochána.As the Minister clearly stated, there is no grand plan to close Garda stations. The Commissioner has significant resources at his disposal in terms of a well-trained and highly motivated force, specialised units, infrastructural assets, and technical assistance to respond to the challenges of the fight against crime.The Minister also announced that the provisional headline crime figures for the first quarter of 2004 show a decrease of 6% when compared to the same quarter last year. While there has been an increase in individual categories, reductions of 36% in murder, 54% in sexual assault and 41% in false imprisonment have been recorded.The Government is not content with focusing only on the effects of crime. Community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes contribute and support in a practical way the work of the Garda in tackling crime. It is only with the full co-operation of local communities that the Garda Síochána can be truly effective in the ongoing fight against crime.As the House is aware, Garda youth diversion projects are a community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative, which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour through the provision of suitable activities designed to enhance personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. Through their efforts the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life in communities and enhancing relations between communities, young people and local gardaí. The success of these projects has resulted in their number growing from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present. This progress was made possible, in part, by funding allocated under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.The amendment commends the unprecedented legislative reform the Government has introduced over the past seven years. I remind the House that 24 items of criminal legislation have been enacted in this period. Currently, eight Bills to reform the criminal law are on the Dáil and Seanad Order Papers, including the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill, which is scheduled to complete Report and Final Stage in the Dáil this evening.A further 11 proposed criminal law reform Bills are at various stages of preparation. Earlier this year, the Minister published the scheme of a revised criminal justice Bill, the aim of which is to provide that the Garda Síochána has at its disposal the necessary legislative framework to allow for the proper investigation and prosecution of crime. The legislation is a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will impact on all types of crime. I commend the amendment to the House.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I support the motion. While the latest crime figures to which the Minister referred show a reduction in crime, they also show worrying increases in certain categories of serious offences. Firearms offences, for example, increased by 53% over the period covered by the report, while the number of burglaries increased by 6%. Most worrying, the number of rapes of females increased substantially and the figure has been substantiated by Rosemary Daly, a spokesperson for the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, who stated that her organisation had received calls relating to 283 rapes in January and February alone. The use of firearms and offences against females are two very worrying aspects of recent crime figures. We have a serious crime problem and the Minister has no reason to crow about figures this evening.On the canvass recently, Deputies will have encountered examples of victims of crime failing to report them. Unfortunately, in some instances where crimes were reported, the Garda did not have sufficient resources to give them immediate attention and in a few cases, they did not do so until several days after the crime had been committed. The Minister must give the Government point of view but he, too, is aware that we have a very serious law and order problem.The Garda has acquired many new responsibilities, even in the past ten years. The force is finding it very difficult to handle the increased complexity of crime and much more is expected of gardaí. For example, they must do much more reporting and their reports must be more detailed and precise than previously; otherwise their evidence may not stand up in court.Being a member of the Garda Síochána is a much more complex job than it was 20 years ago. For this reason, if we want to protect people and guarantee their security, we need more gardaí. There is no doubt that one of the main vote winners for the Government during the previous general election campaign was its commitment to recruit 2,000 additional gardaí. That figure will not be achieved by the next general election and it will be a major issue during the campaign. Even if one only considers the need to replace retiring gardaí and that Templemore cannot handle a large number of recruits at one time, it becomes clear that it will not be possible to reach the figure of 14,000 gardaí, to which the Minister for Defence referred this evening and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last night.Rural Garda stations are a very important issue. As a Deputy from a rural constituency, I hear people voice concerns about the presence of a garda in their village or parish. The Government should introduce a policy that ensures a continuous Garda presence in little villages nationwide. A garda is more than a law enforcer. He or she also supports people in various ways, whether by providing assistance in completing forms, giving advice or offering security, particularly to elderly people who live on their own. They need to know there is someone nearby on whom they can call.I refer to Castleisland, which has a population of 3,000. The Garda operates out of a small rented building, which is totally inadequate. The OPW has been negotiating the acquisition of a new site for two years. Sites are available but there is no commitment to buying a site. I would like the Minister to refer this issue to the OPW.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. This is an extremely important issue. The motion has achieved something in that the Minister has finally published the report on Garda structures and organisation, which has been on his desk for his past six months. His contribution last night was amusing. He brushed off the statements of Fine Gael Members that the report had been delayed. He said it was absurd to say it had been suppressed. He attempted to pass over the delay by saying careful consideration of the proposals was warranted before the publication of the report and the response to it, which I accept. He then asserted the Opposition could not claim the report was secret because he published it on his Department's website yesterday. However, that does not take from the legitimacy of our claim that it was secret for the past six months. Publication of the report yesterday does not detract from that assertion.The report raises a number of serious concerns. The word "reorganisation" sounds sensible and necessary. However, the report needs to be more closely examined. The reorganisation of Garda divisions, regions and districts in the Minister's report means reducing the number of regions by one, the number of divisions by five and the number of districts by between 20 and 32. It is also intended that detective resources will be moved from districts to divisions, thereby lessening the seniority of Garda rank at district level.According to the statistics, the reason most people call to Garda stations is to obtain a garda's signature on an application form for a passport or driver's licence and they do so during regular office hours in between 80% and 90% of cases. However, the remaining 10% to 20% of Garda work is the most crucial and people depend on it most. People want access to gardaí when they need them, not only during office hours. If one knew when one would need a garda, one would not have a problem.Naturally, the districts due to be axed have not been named in the report. The decision has instead been passed on to the Garda Commissioner because he is not an elected official and there will not be repercussions if he makes the announcement rather than the Minister or the Government. Foisting the task on him is the ultimate in political cowardice. The Government should have the courage to name the 20 to 32 districts due to be axed. We will apportion blame for the downgrading of districts to the Government, not the Garda Commissioner.The Minister stated no Garda stations will be closed while the Minister for Defence stated there is no grand plan to close them. We must wait and see. However, reducing the number of districts will have the same effect by making the service more remote and less accessible to those who need it. In addition, this will mean the loss of superintendent posts in these districts. When I was a child the Government of the day said rural Garda stations would not be closed and I accept many remain but they are empty most of the time. Gardaí are present for short fixed periods. I have met gardaí in such stations and they say when they get to the station their time is so short they just about get to open the post that has arrived since their previous visit before travelling to another station or returning to the main station. Rural stations are, therefore, closed. One does not have to be a criminal genius to work out what hours gardaí are present in many areas in rural Ireland. Criminals, therefore, know when to go about their business and it is much easier for them to do so.The Government's amendment refers to its commitment to achieving a force strength of 14,000 members. Commitment is not the same as delivery. The Government can remain committed to every promise it made to the electorate. It promised to deliver 2,000 gardaí but that does mean they will be recruited. By maintaining the promise, the Government is deluding itself that it will increase the force's strength. The Minister for Defence is more aware of the position in the Garda training college at Templemore than the rest of us, given that it is in his constituency. The college only has the capacity to train 690 recruits annually and, therefore, it could not train an additional 2,000 gardaí by 2007. It is a nonsense to insist this can be done.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated he is considering moving phase 5 of Garda training elsewhere but he does not know where or how it will be done. If it is to happen, it is about time he informed us how it will be done. I refer to Garda strength. He stated the strength of the force is in excess of 12,000 and this was achieved for the first time in 2003. That is not true. In reply to a parliamentary question, he stated Garda strength on 1 January 2003 was 11,895 while on 23 February 2004 he stated it was 11,920. When did Garda strength exceed 12,000? This means that 147 additional gardaí have been recruited since the Minister took office. He has a long way to go.The amendment also welcomes the recent decrease in the level of recorded crime and the success of the Garda in combating public order offences. I also congratulate the Garda but the Minister is producing statistics that are cloaked in political spin. When one examines the statistics, one finds the truth. Since 1998, the first full first year the coalition parties spent in office, the number of crimes committed annually has increased by almost 20,000. The Minister should not clap himself on the back. Between 1998 and 2002, the number of crimes increased from 85,000 to 106,000 annually. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe asked the Minister earlier at a meeting of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to outline his benchmark for crime levels. His benchmark is 2002 because recorded crime was particularly high. It will look good for him if he chooses the figures from this year. In addition, one in five crimes is not reported, as highlighted by Fine Gael's research in conjunction with the MRBI. It is little wonder the public feels less safe.I welcome the publication of the Garda Bill which contains many welcome provisions. It is worrying, however, that these provisions will radically alter the relationship between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda. Deputy McDowell thinks he should be the Minister and the Garda Commissioner at the same time. I have a major problem with that. He proposes to politicise the office of Garda Commissioner and I will oppose that at every turn. Why has the Bill been stuck in the Seanad since March?The motion was drafted in an attempt to have the report on Garda structures published. That has happened but the report needs to be studied because some of its conclusions will not improve the situation. I do not see an improvement for people, particularly those in rural Ireland, and people in our cities will not feel more comfortable either. The response from the Government is only to be expected and it looks like it has no real determination to improve things. Presumably members of the Government feel we are the ones harping on about the 2,000 extra gardaí but the Government made that promise and it will have to deliver on it. I want a clear outline of how that will be done because Templemore simply does not have the capacity to produce those gardaí within this time frame.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	525	There are two issues I will address. As we move forward in this millennium, the cost of electricity across the board is considerable. An issue for certain rural areas, particularly for many on the west coast, is the future of wind farms. This is a controversial issue, particularly in light of the Derrybrien land slide. In recent weeks, we, in north Cork and west Limerick, faced a difficulty in that a number of wind farms — 29 wind turbines — were refused permission because of an EU directive on the protection of wild life and the special protection areas for the hen harrier. Planning permission for the wind farms had been granted after an exhaustive consultation process with Cork County Council but an objection was lodged with An Bord Pleanála which saw fit to turn it down. This is a serious issue. An Bord Pleanála, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resource must look at this issue carefully.Given our responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol, we must look seriously at alternative and at green energy. As a result of the level of industrialisation here, we will need far more energy. There is no point in people saying we need to conserve energy. One of the ways to generate that energy is through wind energy. Ireland could benefit enormously from wind energy.In recent years, we have seen rationalisation in the ESB, including the closure of shops. The incentive for a semi-State agency to continue to operate retail outlets has gone. In the past when people did not have as much access to credit as they do today, through the credit unions and so on, they bought electrical appliances and paid for them in their two-monthly ESB bills. There was no massive outcry when we saw the closure of ESB shops, whose day is probably gone. Perhaps if they operated competitively, they may have had a future.Since the foundation of the State, the ESB has been one of the great semi-State bodies. Many people, including grandparents and the older generation, tell us about the arrival of electricity. It has been of considerable benefit. The sector has become more regulated. If one travels through rural areas, one will see many pylons. If the company was only now trying to build its stations and substations that extend the electricity network throughout the country, such plans would probably be bogged down in planning issues.Energy conservation is another issue we need to debate. We need to conserve energy. Private house owners have increasingly insulated their houses to the hilt. Such houses would not have been insulated 25 to 30 years ago and would have required more energy to heat them. Everybody's costs are cut to the bone and there is little scope to invest in energy conservation.I reiterate the first point I made about the future of wind energy, which I have raised on three or four occasions, one such occasion being a few years ago when the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, held office. Guidelines on wind energy are required. People in my area from north Cork and west Limerick who sought planning permission to construct wind farms were turned down because of the need to protect the hen harrier. That was a disgrace. Wind farms have been constructed in almost every other country on the Continent and there have been few difficulties concerning them. The issue of their construction needs to be thrashed out. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government encouraged people to construct wind farms and did not foresee any contravention of the conservation of special protection areas in its documentation submitted to the county council. I have not had sight of its documentation, if any, submitted to An Bord Pleanála.We must be mindful that we will have to generate more energy from wind and other green energy sources going forward. Many individuals throughout the country, some of whom grouped together to form co-operatives, having secured planning permission for the construction of wind farms invested heavily in them on the understanding from Government agencies, particularly the ESB, that if they secured planning permission they would have no problem marketing their enterprises. Deputies who represent rural areas where there are suitable locations for wind farms know of people who have tendered for contracts to supply electricity. They have tendered as low as they can economically, but have been unsuccessful in securing a contract in the AER V or the AER VI competitions. We must seriously consider this area. The ESB and everybody concerned will have ensure clear guidelines are issued, which will honestly and straightforwardly spell out for those who intend to invest a great deal of money in wind farms that securing planning permission will not guarantee them a contract to supply energy in the electricity market.I know of people who started on this course in 1996 or 1997. They invested a great deal of money and thought they had a cast iron guarantee of getting into the market, but they have been left with massive overdrafts and have to make huge repayments to the financial institutions. The ESB and everybody else concerned need to ensure that clear guidelines are issued which point out that there is no guarantee that such investors will obtain contracts. Such guidelines would ensure that people who might rush headlong to invest in such projects would at least know where they stand.I am pleased to have spoken on the Bill and I commend it to the House.

The decision to allow the ESB overall borrowing limit to increase to €6 billion, for which the Bill provides, is a relatively minor one. If the ESB is to strategically carry out what it should do in the next ten years, it cannot be hamstrung by the amount of money it can borrow. Therefore, I do not have a difficulty with that decision.I have not had an opportunity to speak on the ESB for a number of years. I remember the fiftieth anniversary of the date of the company's first supply of electricity some years ago. It has been a wonderful company. It has a great safety record in an industry where the activities engaged in are far from safe. It has also been a good employer. Up to a few years ago I genuinely thought it was one of the best companies we had. However, something strange happened five to eight years ago. The ESB management always made great play of being able to strategically measure into the future, in so far as that is possible, the level of capacity it requires. It is close to breaking point at this time in the sense that the capacity it has and the peak demand capacity are almost one and the same. There is no room for anything to go wrong in any of the generating stations at certain times of the day or the week.Somebody made a big mistake in terms of the investment programme for electricity supply, given that we had to import three major generators last winter or the winter before that to boost output. That is not the way in which a dynamic growing economy should strategically provide for its power base. I heard a major manufacturer say only a few years ago that one of the reasons that company could not locate a major industry in the west was the lack of volume of electricity it could be guaranteed, although I am pleased that deficiency has been rectified. As mentioned by a number of Members, a number of substantial new lines are being built into the west, but the position should not have been allowed to deteriorate to that level.The ESB has a good international image. Today it signed a contract in Kosovo worth €8.8 billion. I am pleased about that and it is important for the image of the company. However, if the company has not been able to get the delivery of its service right at home, it is difficult to understand how it will get it right anywhere else.It is against that background that another issue has to be dealt with by ESB senior management. I refer to the small line work carried out on the ESB poles throughout rural Ireland. I am old enough to remember when the ESB poles were erected. I do not know their projected lifetime but most of them were erected 50 years ago. This problem should have been detected ten years ago, or perhaps it was and nothing was done about it, but that is another story. The company now has to carry out major work in that area.From an industrial point of view, the ESB is not doing well in terms of comparative costs of supply. Some of the figures would lead one to believe its cost base is high compared with other countries. I have a statistic which clearly shows the comparative international industrial price for electricity expressed in US$ or part of a dollar per kilowatt hour. Of a list of approximately ten countries, Ireland ranks second highest at US$0.077, Germany ranks highest at US$0.079 with France ranking lowest at US$0.037. That cost has severe ramifications for our competitiveness.This leads me to the deregulation of the electricity sector. I understand that full deregulation will occur in 2005 but I am not too sure what that means. Does it mean that some operators will supply power only to larger outfits? Will it mean downward pressure on electricity prices for domestic consumers? In other areas, competition has worked dramatically well and I sincerely hope the same will occur in the electricity sector. In the case of Eircom, however, while there are other competitors, it appears that whoever owns the line is in control. I am not sure what sort of deal will emerge but I understand that the ESB will control and operate the power structure throughout the country. I have no problem with that because somebody must do it, but how will that impact on competitors who will have to purchase electricity? Will such competitors be given an opportunity to generate electricity? I do not think that will be the case, so from where will the competition come?The ESB must have competition, and quickly. Last year, the regulator granted the ESB a 14% increase in electricity charges and I understand that we are not far from having another increase. At a time when inflation is so low, I do not understand why the ESB cannot introduce lower price increases. I accept that the company must introduce price increases because it did not seek or receive any for years, but how is it that, according to the grapevine, we may be faced with a further increase of 7% or 10%? If that is the case, electricity costs will have become extraordinarily expensive within a two-year period. There is a sense of rip-off Ireland about this. Are these price increases happening because not enough money was invested in the ESB's infrastructure and, all of a sudden, demand is outstripping supply? If the ESB cannot boost electricity generation, there will be a major problem, especially in the industrial sector, but it has not been made clear why such an increase in the price of domestic electricity units is needed. Nobody has convinced me that the ESB is entitled to the sort of increases it has received lately.The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has made decentralisation proposals but I wonder how deregulation will work in the regions. Will there be an element of cherry-picking? Everyone will want to boost the supply for Dublin, Cork and Galway, but what about Ballinasloe or Ballina? In the course of canvassing last week, I came across a young couple who were living just half a mile off the main road. They had been told by Eircom that they could not get a new telephone connection for at least 12 months because they were so far from the main road. Will the same happen in rural Ireland when the ESB is deregulated? If so, we will have to watch the situation closely. The same thing has happened with the postal services, but I do not have time to debate that now.Either the ESB's planning division identified what should be done and the Government did not agree, or the ESB did not manage to identify what should be done. One way or another, demand for electricity is rising every year. This year, the gap between supply and demand is tighter than ever. If that situation continues unabated for the next few years, we could have a major problem.It is important to consider the mixture of fuels used by the ESB in generating electricity. I note that in the breakdown, gas accounts for 35%, coal 29%, fuel oil 21.8%, peat 11%, and the rest is just 1%. Wind power does not make that much difference to the general mix. I am an advocate of wind power for a variety of reasons, but some people involved in alternative energy in the west have been bitterly disappointed by the way in which their proposals have been treated. The average investment for a modern wind turbine is approximately €1 million, so one can easily calculate the cost of a wind farm featuring ten or 15 such turbines.In earlier years, some people got a return on their capital having received planning permission and gained access to the grid. More recently, however, the situation has become worse because while a person may obtain planning permission against all odds and have a contract with the ESB, he or she may be denied the vital step of gaining access to the grid. It is undesirable and unfair for any Government or semi-State organisation to allow people to take a very expensive route, especially individuals or small groups with no large company supporting them, and then stop dead.If we are ever to have a wind energy policy that works, guarantees should be given by the ESB that once planning permission is granted and the turbines have been built, the ESB will take the power. I do not refer to someone building wind turbines in Letterkenny expecting to be linked to a grid in Sligo. I am realistic enough to know that they must be close to the target grid. However, there should be a binding guarantee on the ESB to take such power supplies, although that is not the case. I do not know who is to blame, but whether it is the ESB or the Government, something has gone wrong.The ESB's fuel mix to which I referred indicates that there is a major opportunity for wind energy. Having said that, I do not want to see any winding down of peat for electricity generation. It makes sense to employ a mix of fuels because when there is a problem with an oil pipeline in Iraq, for instance, one must have access to natural gas. When there are problems with gas and oil supplies, it is important to have access to coal.When there are problems with coal and other supplies, it is important we have our own home-grown energy resources. No matter how we do it, such reserves will only represent a small proportion of what is required for the national grid but it is our insurance policy.There was a great deal of talk about wind energy which has recently died off. The Government and the ESB must make up their minds as to what they want. We know wind energy will not be the cheapest fuel compared with others and if I was the managing director of ESB, I would have to take it into account. However, one can rest assured that whatever fuel is cheapest this year, it will not be so in five years' time, which is why we need a mix of fuel sources. It is within that mix that wind energy should take its place but it is not happening. Many people are angry because they have been let down to the degree that banks have foreclosed on them. They spent a great deal of money building wind turbines because they thought they had access to the national grid but that was not the case and the confidence has now gone from the sector.Environmentalists in this House and outside it argue that we should not burn peat. However, I firmly believe in proportion and appropriate scale and there is always a case to be made for burning peat efficiently. Some of the Finnish technology which we use here burns peat efficiently and the emissions into the environment are a million times lower than they were. There is room for this activity in the coming years. One hopes that when the bogs begin to deplete, biomass and other sources will replace peat. However, it would be most unfortunate if a decision was taken not to burn peat in the power stations because it forms part of the mix to which I have already referred. It makes great sense to use peat for the next 15 or 20 years, provided the technology is the best in the world and the process is as clean as it can be.There is no generating station in east Galway but there are bogs to supply the peat in Ballyforan which is part of the Derryfada group of bogs. Peat production has been slow to get off the ground. It was to provide a backup for the power stations in Offaly and Longford and we were told 80 people would be employed in the past two years but it has not materialised. I do not know what sort of tug of war is going on.Nonetheless, peat can and should be used in the fuel mix because new technology brings it well within the environmental norms. I do not want to pollute the environment and I am satisfied the new technology will prevent power stations from unduly doing so.Unusually, I have recently encountered fairly long delays in the ESB connecting houses to the network. I assume this is because there were more than 77,000 new connections last year but I ask the ESB management to ensure no one has to wait too long. It is a serious problem for young couples who, having built a house, taken a huge loan and paid money for other items, have to wait months for an ESB connection.The EBS's decision to close all its retail shops was a wrong move. The company's retreat from many of the towns which were so good to it over the years is lamentable. It seems to have run away in the face of competition, which made no sense when the company was making a profit. The ESB lost many old friends as a result and, whether or not that continues to be the case, it was a bad PR move for the company.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	527	This is an important Bill which provides for an increase in the ESB's borrowing power to €6 billion by amending section 4 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1954. The current limit of €1.6 billion has remained unchanged for 22 years and is in need of upward revision.In the context of ESB investment, I am in favour of anything that can promote the balanced regional development of the west of Ireland. However, one must ask questions about the Government's record on the national development plan and whether the west will benefit from this increase in ESB funding as will the rest of the country. We hope so but we were full of hope that the west would get its fair share of EU Structural Funds and that there would be balanced regional development. However, that did not happen.We hope that, at some stage, gas will come ashore in Erris, County Mayo, as proposed and that the proposed gas-fired generating station at Bellacorrick will be built. This project has been put on the back burner because the gas is still offshore and the case in regard to bringing it onshore is with An Bord Pleanála. However, people expect the project to proceed eventually. The people are disappointed that the Government has missed out on royalties and tax on gas. Many believe we have thrown away a great deal compared with countries such as Norway which has benefited so much from its natural resources. However, there is no point in closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, unless the gas field is a much greater resource than anticipated, in which case we could qualify for a windfall tax. The people of Mayo will use any resources available to them.In 2001, Rolls Royce Power Ventures Limited announced plans to open a gas-fired power plant at Bellacorrick next to the existing peat-fired station. This was to be a highly-efficient plant which would take its fuel from the Corrib gas field pipeline and generate up to 68 MW which is enough electricity for County Mayo. It would also significantly improve the fragile electricity supply network, enhancing Mayo's capacity to attract new business and industrial development. We have had problems doing just this because we do not have the power, roads, rail or other infrastructure to allow Mayo to be a competitive destination.The proposed power station would create 130 jobs during the two-year construction period, 15 permanent jobs at the operating plant and a further 45 jobs in companies supplying goods and services to it. I spoke to representatives of Rolls Royce today. The company has had a major revamp and my first impression was that the power plant was very much out of mind but, on further investigation, it still appears to be on the agenda. However, it all depends on the gas coming ashore.The new gas pipeline will cross the country. The fear is that the gas will be piped out and nothing will be left. At least the power station would be something. We need to ensure there is provision to allow that gas to be used elsewhere. There is a proposal to bring the gas line to Sligo, in which case it could serve the larger areas of population in Mayo. A gas resource in Mayo would be an advantage in attracting industry. Rather than a pipe taking away natural gas, it should serve our area.That Bellacorick power station is about to close down is a matter of great concern. It has been in existence for 45 years and has been a great source of employment. There is a proposal from private enterprise for a wind farm. The rural community is strong, especially in the west. The Danish approach is to allow wind farms to be run by local co-operatives. That is a model that should be examined by the Government instead of giving it to private enterprise. Communities are capable of doing things themselves. The loss of the ESB generating station at Bellacorick and its supplier, Bord na Móna, which is due to close its operation there shortly, will be a major loss to the area because it employs a workforce of over 250 people. The proposed power station would go some way towards providing employment but it would be very little compared with the gross loss of jobs occurring, which is regrettable.That is the reason we demand the maximum effect from any gas that may be available and which could be used to produce electricity. An offshore terminal would have provided thousands of jobs for the area and would have been one way of avoiding all the environmental chaos predicted with an onshore terminal. If that is unsafe, the people will demand that gas be brought ashore but that there would be maximum benefit for the people of Mayo. The major issue is that we should benefit to the maximum degree, and anything less is not acceptable.There is a great deal of peat in the area. North-west Mayo, in which Bellacorick is located, contains approximately 25% of the national harvestable peat resource. Even over 15 years, the life span of the new midland peat stations, the Mayo peat resource which would be used in a new 75 MW station would amount to 10 million tonnes with a harvestable value of approximately 200,000 tonnes. That is a major resource.The national grid at Bellacorick is on a 110kV line and has limited spare capacity. That line should be upgraded to a 220kV line. The largest wind farm in the world has been proposed for the area, but that would have to feed into a grid which would be incapable of taking the power produced. Some 12 jobs on a wind farm over ten years does not compare with the number of jobs available in Bellacorick. Given that there are replacement stations for other facilities which have been closed by Bord na Móna in the midlands, I do not understand the reason a peat-fired project cannot be made available in Mayo which would employ perhaps 300 people. There is no reason we cannot have wind, gas and peat energy. There is a need to increase our infrastructure to take the power produced.The west has been neglected when one considers the emphasis on the midlands. Bord na Móna would say there is not enough peat in Bellacorick but that is strenuously denied. There is a need for an independent assessment of the peat available there in order that the idea of a peat-powered facility to replace the Bord na Móna facility could be examined. Our Objective One status could be used to help fund that project.The midlands population has increased by 45,000 since 1961 whereas in north-west Mayo the population has decreased by more than 8,000. The area is the largest socio-economically deprived area in Ireland, as shown in the 2002 census. The north-west of County Mayo constitutes 40% of the county land area and has less than 20% of its population. That is the area Professor Caulfield has described as being in a demographic crisis. He predicts that the area west of Killala to Newport will be deserted by the end of the century. If that was any other species except homo sapiens, there would be an outcry by An Taisce and every other body, but homo sapiens matters as well.This is an area that should have a facility to employ people as does Bellacorick. The position is that all the areas, with the exception of St. Brendan's village in Mulranny, showed a decline in population. There were two slight blips but the only significant one is in Newport west which is due to infrastructural deficits. This is all about infrastructure and providing facilities and places where people can work and stay instead of having to leave and find work elsewhere. The population is declining. County Mayo is divided in two parts. Castlebar, Newport and Westport and the south and eastern regions in general show an increase in population whereas the other part of the county is in decline.There is a growing economic divide despite commitments in the national development plan. Therefore, urgent action is required. Bellacorick should be replaced by a peat-powered station capable of providing the same amount of employment. The available resource needs to be examined.The benefit of natural gas from the Corrib field should be exploited to the maximum degree. Why not bring it to Ballina, Castlebar and the larger urban centres in Mayo? It would appear the Government has no intention of providing gas to these areas.There is a need for special tax incentives. Such incentives would ensure people come to and invest in the area. Given what is happening in the area in regard to hotels, it is clear there is a major problem in sustaining viable enterprises in the tourism industry, for example, because of the short tourism season.With proper support Bellacorick should be in production. It is important to have an independent estimate to assess the available resource. Commission for Electricity Regulation studies show that vast reserves of peat remain which could be used by industries clustered around a power plant and create potential employment for several hundred people. A major wind farm would employ approximately 12 people. A gas power plant would employ approximately 15, whereas a peat power plant would generate ten times more jobs and the energy value of peat in the west of Ireland is 7.5% higher than the energy value of peat in the midlands. That would translate into an economic benefit, which should be taken into account.There is a critical need to provide a replacement for the plant in Bellacorick and what better than a peat power plant? The Objective One status will give us the opportunity to derive the maximum benefit. So much EU money was allocated to Ireland on the back of the low development in the west yet the money has come and gone and the west remains the area of least development. This suggestion is something that should be considered.The west enjoys some natural advantages. The midlands has about 20% less rainfall than west Mayo during the harvesting season, but Mayo has a major compensatory advantage with double the level of wind evaporation. It would be advantageous to consider this. Bord na Móna has gone to great lengths to break up the bog drains, which does not make sense. If there is to be proper development of bog, it is necessary to retain the drains as breaking up the bog drains makes the peat unusable. Given the present and future demand for power generation in Mayo, and the fact that Mayo has a natural resource that would yield 25% of the national potential for power generation from peat, along with the potential for renewable energy production in its pulpwood forestry resource, it is a mystery that power generation in the traditional sector is at the point of closing down in Bellacorick and that should be examined.A new peat power plant has the potential to create significant employment, with a potential revenue stream of €40 million a year over the next 30 years from an investment of say €100 million to set up the new peat power station. At the construction phase, 160 workers would be employed for one and a half years. Is that not what using our natural resources is about? There should be positive discrimination in favour of the west. It would mean the national grid at Bellacorick would be improved. It is scandalous that this was not considered as part of the equation. The Minister should give very careful consideration to this.When all the factors are taken into account, it would be logical to locate a new peat power generating station in Mayo. It is akin to throwing out the baby with the bath water not to use our natural resources. To find work, people have to leave the west to come to an area where the traffic has slowed down to the pace of the ass and cart, because it is over-populated. The net industrial output growth nationally from the mid to the late 1990s averaged 19% per annum, whereas the equivalent figure for the west was just more than 7%. In 2000, the western region accounted for 7.5% of all industrial output in the State compared with 12.5% in the midwest, 26.7% in the Dublin region and 27.6% in the southwest. Does that not mean one should concentrate development, if at all possible in the west, where one can retain the population and ensure that people do not have to leave to find the first job?
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I thank Deputies for their insightful and wide-ranging contributions on this necessary legislation for the ESB. The general support for the thrust of the Bill and for the endeavours of the ESB is to be welcomed. I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Coveney and wish him every success in Europe.There have been many changes in the Irish electricity sector in recent years, and this has presented both challenges and opportunities for the ESB and other market players. Deputies Coveney, Ryan and Broughan spoke about the impact of liberalisation on the electricity market. The incremental market opening has introduced an element of choice for consumers. In February this year, 56% of the market was open which means that 14,000 eligible customers are now free to source electricity from licensed electricity suppliers, other than the ESB. The market will be fully open to competition next February, which is a significant advance on the current EU timetable of July 2007 for full liberalisation. The Irish market is the second smallest in Europe, next to Luxembourg and is not yet significantly interconnected. This has been addressed by the recent Government decision to develop two east-west 500 MW interconnectors and this was referred to by Deputies Coveney and Broughan during their contributions to the debate.The Commission for Electricity Regulation, CER, will gauge the level of private sector interest in the development and operation of the interconnector. In the event of there being insufficient interest expressed, steps will be taken to construct and operate an interconnector which would be underpinned by guaranteed regulated revenue stream and it is envisaged the intereconnector will be in place by 2009.The question of ESB dominance was raised by Deputy Coveney during the debate. The Minister is aware that the presence of the ESB in the market as a fully integrated utility is seen by some as an inhibitor to the development of a fully competitive electricity market. He has asked me to point out that the ESB has declared its intention of reducing its market share to 60% by 2006, thus making space for new entrants. As the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated in his opening remarks, in any consideration of the future of the ESB, he is opposed to the privatisation of the networks. These are critical national assets and should remain in State ownership. The Minister also opposes any privatisation which would result in a private monopoly or near monopoly in the power generating sector.While the regulatory approach is appropriate and necessary to deal with the position of the ESB in the marketplace as we approach full liberalisation, consideration must be given as to the steps necessary or desirable to address the concerns about dominance in the medium and longer term. It is not the intention to rush towards any sort of a quick fix solution and whatever decisions are taken will be predicated on a rigorous assessment of all the issues relevant to ESB dominance.On the question of the cost of electricity, determination for that rests with the Commission for Electricity Regulation. Deputies on all sides expressed concern at the rise of electricity prices and these are acknowledged. In terms of a comparison with prices in the European Union, it is worth pointing out that prices for domestic customers are just under the European average, but prices for industrial and commercial users are at the higher end of the scale. However, since the opening of the market, the large scale customers and many small and medium sized enterprises are free to purchase electricity supplies from other companies. Ireland also lacks relatively cheap indigenous resources and must rely heavily on imported fuel supply sources, all of which contribute to higher costs.The question of closure of the old ESB peat stations, including Bellacorick was also mentioned and was raised by Deputy Ring last night. Agreement to close these stations was reached back in February 2000 and their phased closing is being dovetailed with the coming on stream of two new state of the art peat stations in the midlands later this year. This guarantees there is still a place for this natural resource in our generating fuel mix and ensures it is consumed in the most environmentally friendly and efficient manner.The availability of generating capacity was also raised by Deputies Eamon Ryan, Coveney and Broughan. I have been advised that the current capacity can be effectively managed to avoid disruption to electricity users. Allowing for outages, typically 4,450 MW of plant is available for dispatch. In addition, the recent competition conducted by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, facilitates the entry of two new independent generating plants with a combined installed generating capacity of more than 500 MW by 2006.Several Deputies also raised the question of a published energy policy and the Department is continuing its deliberations on the range of issues involved. The production of an energy policy is a significant piece of work. It cannot be produced overnight and a cast-iron guarantee as to when it will be finalised cannot be given. The Department received 46 submissions in response to the consultation document, Options for Future Renewable Energy Policy, Targets and Programmes. The submissions came from a diverse range of respondents. When all the responses have been fully considered, it is intended that a new policy for the renewable energy sector will be submitted to Government for approval later this year.Regarding the development of an all-Ireland energy market, which Deputy Coveney and several other Deputies also raised, the Minister hosted an energy industry information forum last March in conjunction with his former Northern counterpart, Mr. Ian Pearson, MP. Those attending the forum agreed that the all-island energy market joint steering group should prepare a strategic framework document. This is under preparation and is expected to be ready to be published for consultation next week. While the document is still in draft form, I can confirm it will focus on what can be practically delivered in this area by regulators, systems operators and the two Departments within the next three to four years.I thank the Deputies for their many contributions to this Bill. The broad appreciation of the House on the necessity to raise the ESB's statutory borrowing limit is welcome, as is the general consensus on the need for the ESB to continue to invest in the national electricity network. In this regard, the company's ability to obtain keen and competitive funding which will be enabled by enactment of this Bill is of paramount importance. The ESB is, in effect, investing in the future supply of electricity, which is to be commended. I thank the Deputies again for their contributions and I look forward to seeing the Bill go through Committee Stage.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I appreciate the opportunity for the Government to indicate how it expects schools to take seriously the promotion of 2004 as the year of sport in education when schools such as Scoil Phádraic Cailíní in Donabate, County Dublin, roll No. 18412W, are denied necessary grant aid for temporary accommodation. The school is, therefore, given no option but to commandeer its general purpose room as classroom space, thus putting an end to any physical education in inclement weather given that the playground is now, in effect, to be the only PE area. This is, in itself, indefensible.If school children were injected with a disease that crippled them, shortened their lives and increased their dependency on the health services, there would be an outrage, yet we watch helpless as a combination of heavily advertised junk food and inactivity causes a similar effect through obesity, a condition that is rarely curable. The Minister well knows obesity is an increasing phenomenon of modern society, especially among children.It is not merely indefensible, it is grossly damaging to pay such scant regard to the needs of physical education and to require schools effectively to commandeer general purpose physical education areas as classroom space. This is happening in a number of schools I have come across in Donabate and Loughshinny where the Department has said it is not essential to have a general purpose or physical education facility. That is evident from a letter received by the school from the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, which stated: "Only those [schools] with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved [in the last round and, therefore,] your application was not successful on this occasion." What is being said is that the Government does not regard physical education as essential, which is grossly negligent.The Minister said today it would be put right, but not in the short term. That is a total derogation of responsibility. Perhaps we should designate this year as the year of imagining education through sport or the year of dreaming about education through sport because it is not possible for it to happen in such situations. Can the Government not bring some joined-up thinking to its stated objectives and its actions? An extra teacher and furniture have been allocated to this school for September 2004 but the four walls do not exist in which to put the children, the teacher and the furniture.Donabate is increasing in size and its population is projected to be similar to that of Dundalk in the next ten to 15 years. My colleague, Ken Duffy, a local Donabate representative, organised a public meeting to highlight the irresponsibility of much of the rezoning that is taking place without provision for facilities. This type of activity begs the question of for whom the Government is acting and what end it is serving when a place like Donabate with a burgeoning population does not have a secondary school, in spite of the fact that the nearby schools are full. Local people have to resort to private fund-raising activities to provide a hall for sport in their new school. Loreto College Balbriggan is not alone full, it has a 1907-built hall in a dangerous state of disrepair, a matter I previously raised on the Adjournment.If 11 June was not bad enough for it, the Government will incur the wrath of the electorate next time out. It is unable to see the wood for the trees in this regard and, as a result, it is also incurring enormous costs into the future if children are not given the opportunity for activity and physical education which is a required part of any civilised society. It is an intrinsic part of natural development that children should have physical education. The Minister is effectively saying we can forget about physical education as it is not a requirement and the general purpose room can be used as a classroom as if that is normal. That is gross irresponsibility and should be addressed immediately.

Ní raibh méábalta an óráid a fháil, agus tá mé buíoch den Teachta as an straitéis chuimsitheach atá ag an Roinn Oideachais mar gheall ar na cúrsaí a luaigh sé maidir le Scoil Phádraic Cailíní a chur ós comhair na Dála. Chuir an scoil iarratas isteach don Roinn i Meán Fómhair. Tá sí suite in áit atá taobh amuigh, ach gan bheith iargúlta.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	547	Tá a fhios agam faoi sin. Is mór an trua é nach bhfuil an fhadhb chéanna againne. Tá fadhbanna speisialta i mBaile Átha Cliath. É sin ráite, in the context of the available funding and the number of applications for that funding, it was not possible to approve all applications for temporary accommodation this year and only those schools with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved. All other schools, including Scoil Phádraic Cailíní, are required, as an interim measure, to maximise the use of existing accommodation until the Department is in a position to make extra accommodation available.The priority of the Department of Education and Science has been to concentrate resources on providing permanent accommodation for schools and to reduce the dependency on temporary accommodation which may not always give value for money solutions. In this regard, the need for extra permanent accommodation at Scoil Phádraic Cailíní will be considered in the context of a review which is being undertaken of all projects that did not proceed as part of the 2004 school building programme. This is being done with a view to including such projects as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005 onwards. As part of this process, consultations have already taken place with the education partners. The purpose of these consultations is to ensure that the prioritisation criteria used for prioritising large-scale building projects have optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of the primary and post-primary sectors. The Department expects to be in a position to make a further announcement in this matter later this year.In addition, over the remainder of this school year, a new school planning model involving published area development plans will be piloted in five areas. Included in the pilot scheme is the north Dublin-south Louth region which covers the Donabate area. The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process. Following the consultation process, individual plans will set out the blueprint for schools' development in an area covering a period of up to ten years.The Department is confident that this approach to school planning will provide a mechanism for ensuring that, in future, capital investment in school infrastructure, will not alone be targeted at those schools most in need but that it will also be made in the most open and transparent way.Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Teachta arís, cé go raibh ócáid aige an cás seo ——

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	550	I again raise the issue of the orthopaedic unit in Castlebar and hope that the Minister of State with responsibility for health will have definite answers for Members and the people of Mayo.The promise was made that the orthopaedic unit would open on 1 July 2004. An orthopaedic surgeon was appointed and professional staff were given contracts. We expected people to be undergoing operations in Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar by the second week of July. Two weeks ago after a health board meeting, it was brought to the attention of the board members and the public that the orthopaedic unit would not open on the promised date. Last week on the local Mid-West Radio, the Minister for Health and Children told the people of Mayo and the surrounding areas that his Department would have discussions with the Western Health Board on the matter of the staffing of the orthopaedic unit for the hospital. However, he gave no definite commitment as to when the orthopaedic unit would open.I raised the matter on the Adjournment that night, as did Deputy Cowley the following night. On the following day, a week ago today, Deputy Flynn, who is not involved in the Department and not even a member of Fianna Fáil, was able to inform the people of County Mayo at a rally of 5,000 people that the orthopaedic unit would open on 1 September.When will the orthopaedic unit open? I want a definite date from the Minister of State. I want to know whether the contracts that have been offered to staff will be honoured. Will the orthopaedic surgeon who has been appointed be left doing nothing over the summer while people in my county and constituency suffer in pain as they wait for the hip operations they were promised would be available by the second week in July?I had the pleasure last week of meeting the surgeon appointed. I am delighted with the appointment. He is a fine, pleasant person and I am sure he will do an excellent job for the people of County Mayo and the surrounding area.I have a question for the Minister of State, for the chief executive of the health board and the board as a whole. Why was the timing changed and the unit not opened as planned? It has been promised for many years. Why do we now have the situation where the orthopaedic surgeon, management and other staff have been appointed but the unit will not open? Why did the Department and the chief executive of the health board not sort out the problem well before July? Why am I told in every reply I receive from the Department that it is talking to the orthopaedic surgeons in Galway? What has this unit to do with Galway?The orthopaedic surgeons in Galway have refused to take patients from Mayo for the past few months. The people of Mayo have no service now. We have emergency services where people who break a leg or an arm will be sent to Galway. However, if a routine check is involved or a person is waiting to be assessed for a hip replacement, the people in Galway will no longer accept them.This Government got a message last weekend. The people of Mayo are waiting to march again. They are angry.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	552	The Minister for Social and Family Affairs may be among those who are due a change and, from what I hear, she may end up on the back benches. I do not mind where the Minister goes although I prefer to see her rather than some others on the Front Bench, although she might not do a better job than in her current Department.Fianna Fáil said this promise that the orthopaedic unit would be up and running in July would be honoured. When will the unit in the Mayo General Hospital open? I want an announcement on this immediately. I do not want a former Fianna Fáil backbencher telling us one thing, the Minister telling us something else and the chief executive of the health board telling us something else. It is no wonder the health service is in disarray when nobody knows what is going on. The Minister and the chief executive of the health board do not know what is going on, yet a former Fianna Fáil backbencher tells us the unit will open.I want to give the Minister and Fianna Fáil a warning. A record amount of shoes were bought last weekend because the people are on the march. If they have to march to Galway, Dublin, Donegal or the Minister's constituency office, they will do so. This is one broken promise they will not suffer. I hope we get good news tonight from the Minister of State.

#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	554	Go raibh maith agat. This is an extremely serious matter. As a GP I sat in my surgery ten years ago and saw the deprivation experienced by people. I knew the distances people had to travel. If a person broke a hip, he or she was forced to travel all the way to Galway which is the equivalent distance of someone here in this House going all the way to Galway to the same unit. It is virtually the same distance from the end of Mayo to Galway. That is not an acceptable situation. It would not be acceptable to the people in this House and it is not acceptable to the people of Mayo. I started the campaign for an orthopaedic unit ten years ago. There is at present a 33-bed unit and theatre lying idle since 2001. We have no elective service since January this year because the four orthopaedic surgeons pulled out unilaterally. Unless one is a private patient, one will not be seen by the surgeons in Galway. It is unacceptable that there is no service. This is health apartheid for Mayo patients, particularly for Mayo patients who have no elective service.The terrible deprivation I witnessed ten years ago is still there. People wait for years for a hip operation. Some people have been on the waiting list since 2000. The treatment purchase fund is no good to them because they have not yet seen a consultant. It is a second-class service.Earlier this year, the Western Health Board with the approval of the Department of Health and Children recruited 58 staff and announced an opening date of 1 July. Those people have now been informed there are no jobs for them. Those for whom the health board has contractual obligations have been informed they will be assigned to inferior posts. For instance, a senior theatre sister has been offered a job as a junior ward sister. An occupational therapist has been offered a half-time post in the Sacred Heart hospital for older people. The junior hospital doctors have all left because they need to find other posts. The choice is to go to Galway. An excellent locum orthopaedic surgeon has been hired. Another locum orthopaedic surgeon has been hired but he has returned to India and does not know he has no job. People are being offered jobs that are different to the jobs for which they were contracted. There are 1,500 people on the waiting list since 2000. That is a list with no end and on which the people of Mayo must suffer.We have been told in a roundabout way that 1 September may well be an opening date but there has been no official notification. If the ceiling has been agreed on the whole-time equivalent situation, then the unit can open on 1 July. If it can open on 1 September because that problem has been sorted out, then it can open on 1 July. If it is delayed until 1 September, the staff will not be available. Why should they stay when they have been offered inferior jobs?Last week, I organised a march and 5,000 people took to the streets. The people are taking to the streets again on this night fortnight. I guarantee there will be treble or quadruple that number on the march. People will not accept what is happening. Two weeks ago, the Minister and the Minister for State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, informed me that discussions were ongoing between orthopaedic staff in Galway-Mayo but that is not so. Deputy Carty called me a liar, a rabble rouser and an alarmist but still no discussions have taken place. There is no need for discussions because the plan is already in existence for a fully-fledged orthopaedic unit in Mayo. However, that is not acceptable to the people in Galway who want to give us a second-class service but we will not accept that.A horse is better treated in this country. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, had €50 million to spend in Punchestown. Who would not wish to be a horse? At least one would be given plenty of nuts and romancing and one's boss would receive a tax relief. A patient in Mayo is not even treated like the horses in Punchestown and that is not acceptable. People are being treated badly in a second-class service. It is unacceptable they must travel long distances. The people have taken to the streets and it is wrong they were forced to do so. They will take to the streets again. I ask the Government to think about people and less about the economy. What is more important than people? I ask the Minister and the Government to show some heart. We demand this unit opens in July. We demand a definite commitment for a start date. We demand that all the required staff are hired, which is 68 staff and another 68 people. The people of Mayo deserve no less. We want straight answers from the Minister.

The second phase of a major development programme at the hospital began in 1998. The capital cost of this investment was €50 million——

This development included a new accident and emergency department; a medical assessment unit; a geriatric assessment unit; an obstetric and delivery suite; CT scanning facilities; a new helicopter landing facility; improved mortuary and post-mortem room; a new information technology system; a new administration and medical records department.It also provided the necessary facilities for the development of orthopaedic services at Mayo General Hospital including ward accommodation and a state-of-the-art orthopaedic operating theatre to carry out surgery.Annual revenue funding for Mayo General Hospital is now over €50 million. This Government has increased expenditure at the hospital by €30 million since 1997. The hospital now employs around 830 whole-time equivalent staff.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	589	This represents an increase in staffing levels at the hospital of over 300 whole-time equivalent staff in the past seven years. These extra staff are providing additional and improved hospital services to the people of Mayo. Activity at the hospital has increased year on year. By comparison to its activity in 1997 the hospital has increased its in-patient activity by over 3,000 people per annum and has nearly trebled the number of patients it treats as day cases. The hospital's in-patient and day-case activity for 2003 was over 22,000 patients. Some 27,000 persons attended the casualty department in 2003. The hospital's out-patient department now treats over 33,000 people. There has been an increase in the number of beds at the hospital in recent years and the number of beds there when the orthopaedic service opens will be more than 300.

Currently, one consultant orthopaedic surgeon has been recruited by the Western Health Board and took up duty on 1 February. The Western Health Board has informed the Department that discussions between the orthopaedic staff in Galway and Mayo are continuing in an effort to configure the best use of the facilities at Galway and Mayo. These discussions are taking place within a framework to develop an overall integrated strategic and operational policy for orthopaedic services in the region.

The Western Health Board has advised the Department that staff recruited for the orthopaedic unit at the hospital are not being asked to accept alternative positions to those originally offered to them. All offers of employment to individuals for positions in the orthopaedic service at Mayo General Hospital will be honoured in full. This has been explained individually by telephone to each candidate, in addition to the relevant confirmation of appointment being sent to them. I hope that clarifies the matter for Deputy Cowley.The in-patient orthopaedic service is scheduled to start in September 2004. In the meantime, patients will be seen on an out-patient basis. The preparation of the unit, development of policies and procedures and staff familiarisation will also take place in the meantime. The Department has agreed to work with the board for the remainder of the year to ensure compliance with approved staffing levels. The Minister will ensure that the new orthopaedic services are established at Mayo General Hospital at the earliest possible date.

The matter I raise is related to the reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 98 and 610 yesterday. I would not have raised the matter except that the Minister appeared to protest too much to the effect that——
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I expressed concern.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	614	No, she protested her innocence to the effect that I should know that certain procedures have always been in place when the reverse is the case. She also thought I was referring to a particular case when I was referring to several cases related to the cuts imposed in the most recent budget. The matter concerns a young mother whose child was born subsequent to the death of her husband.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	615	No.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	616	The Minister knows it is a fact and should not protest. When a single mother or widow has a second or subsequent child, the child dependant allowance has, heretofore, always been payable to the mother in respect of the child. However, in the case of mothers resident in rent supported accommodation and in receipt of supplementary rent allowance, they find that their child dependant allowance also incurs a penalty, namely, the reduction of the rent allowance by a commensurate amount. This has never been the case and is illegal. The Minister should know that and, with all due respect to her, whoever codded her into believing this practice is acceptable is wrong.A similar practice was used by local authorities around ten years ago when they deprived local authority tenants receiving rent allowance of social welfare increases by increasing the rent by the same amount. This is an illegal practice and the Minister is wrong to approve it. If she does not do something about it as a matter of urgency, a case will be taken to the courts and won by the people concerned for the simple reason that——
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	617	Under no circumstances would a case be won.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	618	——if an increase due to a person causes the Minister to modify policy in a way that deprives the person of his or increase——
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	619	The Deputy knows better than that.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The child dependant allowance is in respect of the child and has nothing to do with rent allowance. The person receiving child dependant allowance is entitled to the same rent allowance to which he or she was entitled before the child was born. The birth of the child incurs certain additional expenditure and the child dependant allowance is merely intended to compensate the parents for this expenditure. If the Minister is not aware of this, she has a serious problem. Whoever advised her to take this route advised her wrongly.As a former Minister of State in the Minister's Department, I strongly advise her to re-examine the matter and change the rules because they are wrong. There is no basis in law for proceeding on the basis that a person may be deprived of an increase in payment of benefit by virtue of a decision of a Minister to reduce another payment by an equivalent amount. I will give an example. The income of a person who is not in receipt of allowance but paying rent in the normal manner would not be affected in similar circumstance.I ask the Minister to review the position as a matter of urgency. If she fails to do so, she will be liable and in breach of the law.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I would never introduce to a debate the circumstances of an individual. Subject to certain conditions, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department, provides for the payment of rent supplement to eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources.Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently €13 per week, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.The regulations governing rent supplement stipulate that in addition to the minimum contribution, recipients are also required to contribute towards their rent any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate. This requirement is not new and is set out in the regulations governing the scheme, of which I am sure the Deputy, as a former Minister of State in my Department, is aware.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	631	At present the rate of child increase under the one parent family scheme is €19.30 per week while the corresponding rate under the basic supplementary welfare allowance scheme is €16.80. Where a person on one parent family payment who is in receipt of rent supplement has an additional child, the rent supplement is reduced by €2.50, the difference between these amounts. This has always been a feature of the rent supplement scheme and I have not altered the rules in this regard.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	633	When a case is being reviewed, changes in the applicant's household composition or financial circumstances are taken into account in determining the amount of rent supplement payable. For example, a person could receive an increase in maintenance payments which would have an effect on the rent supplement payable.

I understand from the health board that the case has again been reviewed to take account of the fact that the person concerned is in receipt of additional maintenance payments in respect of her second child. Child benefit is also payable in respect of additional children but this money is not assessable for rent supplement purposes.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	655	I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 95 and 113 together.The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime search-and-rescue services within the Irish search-and-rescue region. The Air Corps provides the search-and-rescue, or SAR, service off the north-west coast, while CHCI, a private operator, provides the service from Dublin, Shannon and Waterford.Late last year, I announced my decision to withdraw the Air Corps from the search-and-rescue service. That decision was made only following a considered assessment of the capacity of the Air Corps to return to and maintain a full 24-hour service in the north-west. As Deputies will recall, the service had been restricted following an unusually high incidence of sick leave among the winch crews. There is no plan to reconsider the decision to withdraw from the search-and-rescue service.The Air Corps will continue to provide its current limited service, while the coast guard makes alternative arrangements for the return of a full SAR service in the north-west. I have been informed by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that the proposals are still under assessment, and a final decision in that regard is expected shortly.Air Corps pilots will continue to train in search-and-rescue techniques, and it is envisaged that they will provide support for limited non-maritime search and rescue services.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	656	I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 82 together.The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces, including the reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation of women in all aspects of Defence Forces' activities.Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the reserve Defence Force and to compete for promotion on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. Female officers are generally being promoted at the same stage in their career as male officers. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.The military authorities advise that the trend for general service recruitment has been that 9% of all applicants have been female and that on average 9% of enlistment has been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume that the pattern will change to any great degree. Some 15.4% of applicants for the 2003 cadetship competition were female. Some 15.5% of successful candidates were female.Under the terms of the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Defence Forces are prohibited from operating recruitment policies that discriminate on grounds of gender.To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces, I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5' 4", and that height requirement now also applies to male recruits.The Defence Forces actively encourage female applicants, for example, by: (a) advertising — where possible, all graphical advertisements and booklets produced for the Defence Forces show both male and female personnel and emphasise that all applicants are assessed on an equal basis; (b) recruitment fairs — stands at recruiting fairs are generally staffed by male and female personnel; and (c) visits to schools — when the Defence Forces are invited to give talks at all female or at mixed schools, every effort is made to have a female speaker.Over the past six years, the strength of female personnel in the Defence Forces has grown from 244 at the end of 1997 to 484 at the end of 2003. In percentage terms that represents an increase from 2.11% to 4.61% of total strength.The strength of females by rank in the Defence Forces as at the end of April 2004 is provided in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.LtGenMajGenBrigGenColLtColComdtCaptLtTotalOffrsSmBQMSCsCQMSSgtsCplsTotal NCOsPtesCadetsTotalArmy00001133031750031108910321314405Air Corps00000012300100789121Naval Service00000021416000002243566
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	657	I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 92 together.Ireland's commitment to the Helsinki headline goal, which is the more accurate term for what is commonly referred to as the rapid reaction force, consists of an offer of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations standby arrangements system, or UNSAS. I should stress that the commitment to the Helsinki headline goal should not be interpreted as an additional commitment of the Defence Forces to overseas operations. In that regard, national sovereignty is a fundamental underlying principle to participation in the European security and defence policy. Ireland will approach each proposed mission on a case-by-case basis and will only participate in operations authorised by the United Nations and with the approval of the Government and this House.That commitment to international peacekeeping, humanitarian and crisis management operations represents some 10% of the Army and is a considerable undertaking by any standard. In that regard, almost 750 members of the Defence Forces are currently deployed overseas on peace support operations.Ireland has been an active participant in the continued development of the European security and defence policy, or ESDP, and the Government remains committed to that participation. I should stress that the development of the ESDP does not amount to a common European defence strategy as suggested in Deputy Crawford's question.I have reported to this House on previous occasions on the good progress which has been made during the Irish Presidency, and I welcome the opportunity to report on recent developments in this regard.The adoption by the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 17 May 2004 of a new headline goal with a horizon of 2010 has been a key development during our Presidency.In that regard, member states have decided to set themselves a new headline goal, reflecting the European security strategy, which was adopted by the heads of state and 
Government in Brussels in December 2003, taking into account the evolution of the strategic environment and drawing on lessons learned from previous EU-led crisis management operations. Member states have decided to commit themselves to be able by 2010 to respond with rapid and decisive action, applying a fully coherent approach to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty on the European Union. That includes humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks, and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. Member states have also recognised that interoperability, deployability and sustainability must be at the core of member states' efforts and will be the driving factors of the 2010 headline goal.The ability for the EU to deploy force packages at high readiness, commonly known as battle groups, as a response to a crisis, either as a stand-alone force or as part of a larger operation enabling follow-on phases, is also a key element of the 2010 headline goal. The development of such a rapid response capability for the European Union has also been an important focus for work during our Presidency.I am particularly pleased that significant progress has been made regarding the development of the EU's relationship with the UN in accordance with the EU-UN joint declaration of 24 September 2003.As I reported earlier today to the House, political agreement on the joint action establishing the European defence agency was reached at the GAERC meeting on 14 June 2004. It is now intended that formal adoption of the legal act to establish the agency will take place before the end of the Irish Presidency.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	658	I have been advised by the military authorities that the investigation into the matter was completed this week. The investigating officer has now submitted a final report to the military authorities for consideration. I expect to receive a copy of the final report in the near future.As I have previously indicated to the House, I have asked that a report on the investigation be submitted to me as soon as possible. Once I receive the final report, I will consider whatever recommendations may be made to me regarding the ongoing management and control of military ranges.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	659	Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued through the United Nations, which has the primary role in the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN has no standing military forces of its own and relies on the voluntary provision of resources by willing members. At a time of geopolitical instability and change, I believe that it is important that the international community continue to support the United Nations in maintaining peace and stability.At present, according to the Defence Acts, Defence Forces personnel can serve overseas only in an operation established by the UN Security Council or General Assembly.The provisions for the participation of members of the Defence Forces in overseas missions are set out in the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, as amended by the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993, which provides that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State, as part of a particular international United Nations force.Participation in an overseas operation requires UN authorisation, a specific Government decision and, where the level of participation is to exceed 12 members of the Defence Forces, the approval of Dáil Éireann.While I would not wish that our legislative provisions should prevent the Defence Forces from participating in missions which support Ireland's underlying principles of providing support in the areas of international peacekeeping, humanitarian missions, or peace support operations, I believe that it is important at this time that our decision-making process continue to reflect our support for the United Nations.In that regard, I believe that the circumstances which arose regarding the participation of the Defence Forces in the first EU peace support operation, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, are unlikely to recur. Those circumstances, it will be recalled, related to the fact that, while United Nations Resolution No. 1371 welcomed international efforts, including the efforts of the EU, to support the implementation of the Ohrid peace agreement in FYROM, it did not authorise an international United Nations force as required by the Defence Acts.That was a unique situation, and I expect that future EU "Petersberg task" missions will have the required UN authorisation, thereby enabling the Government to consider Defence Forces participation on a case-by-case basis.However, as I stated in the past, in a volatile international security environment, I believe that we should keep the matter under review to ensure that we are not found wanting should circumstances arise where the Government would wish to consider Defence Forces participation in a crisis calling for a response from the international community which conforms to Ireland's proud tradition of contributing to international peace and security.

For security reasons, it is not the policy to disclose the type of equipment available to the ranger wing.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	661	A total of 28 non-commissioned officers have been commissioned as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service in the past five years.Potential officer courses, or POCs, are held for non-commissioned personnel from time to time within the Defence Forces. Personnel who successfully complete such courses are commissioned as officers in the Permanent Defence Force. Participants on such courses are selected on a competitive basis. In addition, from time to time non-commissioned personnel who hold appropriate qualifications are commissioned to fill specialist appointments where vacancies arise. Eligible non-commissioned personnel may also apply for the annual cadetship competitions. The requirement for potential officer courses and commissioning from the ranks, or CFR, competitions is reviewed from time to time and is being specifically addressed in the context of the integrated personnel management system, or IPMS, which is one of the major policy initiatives provided for in the White Paper on defence. The IPMS will make specific and ongoing provision for the introduction of regular schemes to commission enlisted personnel as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.Draft conditions governing the appointment of enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force to be officers of the Naval Service are under discussion with the representative associations. As the discussions with the representative associations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to comment on any of the specifics of the proposed draft conditions. However, it is the intention that a potential officer course will be run as soon as those discussions have been completed.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 85 together.The procurement process for the acquisition of new helicopters for the Air Corps has commenced. Following discussions between senior officials in my Department and the military authorities, it has been decided that up to six helicopters will be acquired, two light utility helicopters primarily for Air Corps crew training purposes, and four larger utility helicopters, with the option of two further such helicopters for use in support of the Army and for other ancillary uses such as air ambulance. The new aircraft will replace the current fleet of Dauphin, Alouette and Gazelle aircraft.The tender competition was advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 29 May 2004. The closing date for the receipt of tenders is Friday, 23 July 2004.The two light utility helicopters will be operated by the Air Corps primarily in the military pilot and air crew training role. Primary taskings for the helicopters will include pilot training, instructor training and instrument flight training.The four utility helicopters will be operated by the Air Corps in a general purpose military operational and training role. They will not be dedicated for use by any particular element of the Defence Forces including the Army ranger wing. Primary taskings for the utility helicopter will include training and operations with special forces, security and aid to the civil power, military exercises, infantry interoperability training and limited troop transport. The helicopters will also be required to perform air ambulance, aid to the civil community and VIP transport tasks. On training, the utility helicopters will be involved in conversion training, winching and inland search-and-rescue training and night vision equipment development and operations. The use will therefore meet a wide spectrum of the Defence Forces' requirements.The contract for the supply of the helicopters will be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender applying the following award criteria which are listed in order of priority: functional characteristics, operational suitability and technical merit; maintenance, technical support and after sales service; tender prices; life cycle costs over 20 years; training packages offered; warranties offered; and delivery period.Allowing for receipt of tenders, tender evaluation, presentations, test flights, visits to facilities and contract negotiations, I would expect to award the contract some time in the autumn. As the Deputy will appreciate, at this early stage in the process it is extremely difficult to be very precise about these matters. However, every effort will be made to ensure that the process moves along as quickly as possible to ensure that the new helicopters are available to the Air Corps at the earliest possible date.The procurement of modern light utility helicopters will provide a significant boost to the Air Corps in available flying hours at reduced maintenance costs, compared with the existing aircraft in the Air Corps helicopter wing. It will also provide increased capability in the roles currently undertaken by the existing Air Corps light utility helicopters.My decision to proceed with the tender competition was based on the recommendations contained in the report of the joint military and civil board, which examined the rotary wing requirements of the Air Corps. The report of the board also dealt with the procurement of medium lift helicopters for the search and rescue service in the longer term. However, as the Air Corps will no longer be providing that service, this part of the report will not be implemented.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	663	I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 114 together.There are a total of 40 aircraft in service with the Air Corps at present. There are 15 helicopters and 25 fixed-wing aircraft. The type and age of those aircraft are as follows.Aircraft TypeNumber in serviceAge

In that regard, I signed a contract on 16 January 2003 for the supply of eight turbo-propeller aircraft to replace the Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. Those aircraft will allow for the continued training of young cadets to the highest standards. The new aircraft is the Pilatus PC-9M, manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft Limited, Switzerland. The cost of the eight aircraft is approximately €60 million. Seven aircraft have already been delivered, and the remaining aircraft is currently in Austria for a weapons certification programme. While those aircraft are being obtained primarily for pilot training, they will be capable of being armed and, as such, will have a limited defensive capability.I have recently commenced the procurement process for the acquisition of new helicopters for the Air Corps and, in that regard, a tender notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 29 May with a closing date for response of Friday, 23 July. Up to six helicopters will be acquired, two light utility helicopters, primarily for Air Corps crew training purposes, and four larger utility helicopters, with an option for a further two such helicopters, for use in support of the Army and for other ancillary uses such as air ambulance. The new aircraft will replace the current fleet of Dauphin, Alouette and Gazelle aircraft. I have instructed my officials and the military authorities to give that procurement process top priority to ensure that a contract can be placed as early as possible.Any further acquisitions or upgrades would be dependent on a review of needs and budgetary resources at any given time.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	665	Emergency planning for major accidents and emergencies has been ongoing for many years. That has been carried out at local level and co-ordinated on a regional basis in accordance with the Government framework for co-ordinated response to major emergencies.The Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform monitor and advise on the preparation, co-ordination and testing of emergency plans by the local authorities, health boards, and the Garda Síochána in line with the framework and, as necessary, on the co-ordination arrangements at national level to facilitate those responses. Various other Departments and public authorities, including the Defence Forces, provide support to that framework.I can assure the Deputy that Departments continue to take a lead role in planning for emergencies in areas for which each has statutory responsibility. The relevant Departments are responsible for ensuring that they have the necessary legislation, personnel, equipment and the planning arrangements in place to respond to emergencies, including the responses of bodies under their aegis.Arising from the events of 11 September 2001, the Government responded by establishing an office of emergency planning in my Department and by setting up a Government task force on emergency planning to co-ordinate emergency planning and response arrangements across those Departments that lead and support the State's response in large-scale emergencies.As chairperson of the Government task force, I have requested all authorities to review their emergency plans and revise them as appropriate. That has led to continuous examination and evaluation of emergency plans to ensure that the arrangements are current and effective. The task force has worked to co-ordinate emergency planning and response arrangements across those Departments that lead and support the State's response in an emergency.The focus for that work continues to be on making the necessary arrangements, at best, to prevent, or, at least, to minimise the risks from terrorist activities by ensuring that the protection available to the Irish people is maximised. Potential threats to the State arising from international terrorism are continuously monitored by those involved, principally the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.International linkages have also been important as a means of sharing expertise and resources. The European Union continues to develop programmes to improve co-operation within the Union, to prevent and limit any consequences of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear terrorist threats. That was given new impetus by the EU declaration on combating terrorism agreed under the Irish Presidency, which, among other things, emphasises the benefits of co-operation and co-ordination. The fight against terrorism requires member states to engage in formulating action plans across the whole of the European Union, and in response a counter-terrorism co-ordinator has been appointed to bring together the different processes at an EU level.The Government task force meets regularly and continues to be an important mechanism to integrate the emergency planning efforts of Departments and other public authorities to provide for co-ordinated emergency responses. I am satisfied that the various plans developed and reviewed since the establishment of the task force are well co-ordinated and have significantly enhanced the response potential of the State in the event of a large-scale emergency.The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to large-scale emergencies. As chairperson of the task force, my approach continues to be that such responses should be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements. The awareness that the situation could change rapidly, and with little warning, has ensured that vigilance is maintained. Should the situation regarding Ireland change, the task force will provide the necessary co-ordination to promote the best use of the State's emergency response resources. That approach to emergency planning is very effective, and I will continue this work and report regularly to the Government and to this House on those matters.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	667	Drug abuse has long been recognised as a serious and escalating problem in our society, and while there have been relatively few instances of drug-related problems in the Defence Forces, it is recognised that the Defence Forces, as a component of the wider community, mirror the community at large. The implications of drug abuse in an organisation where personnel have access to fire arms are too obvious to require elaboration.A compulsory substance-testing programme was introduced on 1 February 2002 as part of a Defence Forces substance abuse programme, following a long consultative process involving the Office of the Attorney General, the Deputy Judge Advocate General and the Defence Forces' representative associations.Before the launch of the programme, an education programme and awareness briefings were conducted throughout the Defence Forces. All personnel were issued with a booklet devised to inform them of the purpose of the new compulsory random drug-testing programme, the administrative procedures involved and the sanctions against those who test positive. All necessary measures, including pre-enlistment screening, education, compulsory random drug testing, monitoring and sanctions, will be taken to maintain a drug-free environment in the Defence Forces.The primary objective of compulsory random drug-testing is deterrence. To provide a credible level of deterrent, the testing programme has been devised to maximise the possibility of random selection for testing. A trained drug-testing team is responsible for taking urine samples for compulsory random testing throughout the Defence Forces. Testing commenced on 14 November 2002, and the programme is now in its second year of operation. The target of testing 10% of the Permanent Defence Force has been achieved. A member of the Permanent Defence Force, randomly selected, may be required, at any time, to provide a urine sample which will be tested for evidence of use of controlled drugs, or the abuse or misuse of other substances, or for the detection of the metabolites thereof. A member of the PDF who refuses to provide a urine sample, or who provides a urine sample which tests positive, shall be liable to retirement, discharge or relinquishment of commission or withdrawal of cadetship as appropriate under the provisions of Defence Force regulations.I have been advised by the military authorities that a total of 1,694 of all ranks have been tested to date. There have been five positive tests. Where personnel have confirmed positive test results, they are discharged or retired in accordance with the relevant regulations.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	668	The most recent meeting of the Government task force on emergency planning was held on Tuesday, 25 May. The task force has met on four occasions — 18 February, 25 March, 22 April and 25 May — during 2004, and met on a total of nine occasions in 2003. I continue to keep matters under review, and the Departments concerned have work programmes in place for dealing with matters relating to the work of the task force. The next task force meeting will be convened as and when required regarding the ongoing work.The task force has worked, since it was set up in 2001, to co-ordinate emergency planning and response arrangements across those Departments that lead and support the State's response in an emergency.The focus for that work continues to be on making the necessary arrangements, at best, to prevent or, at least, to minimise the risks from terrorist activities by ensuring that the protection available to the Irish people is maximised. The emphasis is on putting mechanisms in place to support the response agencies and on providing co-ordination for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.Potential threats to the State arising from international terrorism are continuously monitored by those involved, principally the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The advice available to me is that, while the Garda authorities recognise that the terrorist threat to Europe may currently be high, regarding Ireland it is low. The awareness that the situation could change rapidly, and with little warning, has ensured that vigilance is maintained. Should the situation regarding Ireland change, the task force will provide the necessary co-ordination to promote the best use of the State's emergency response resources.Emergency planning preparations are designed to ensure that as far as possible the necessary advance planning is in place to deal with the consequences of any incident that may arise.A critical issue in an emergency situation is the question of issuing adequate and timely warnings and providing the necessary information to the general public on threatened or developing emergency situations. The EU civil protection mechanism and other international mechanisms provide Ireland with certain warning and alert systems and mechanisms. Television and radio broadcasting will be the key means of contact with the public in such circumstances, but all other means of communication will be utilised.International linkages have also been important as a means of sharing expertise and resources. The European Union continues to develop programmes to improve co-operation within the Union to prevent and limit any consequences of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear terrorist threats. That was given new impetus by the EU declaration on combating terrorism agreed under the Irish Presidency, which, among other things, emphasises the benefits of co-operation and co-ordination.I am pleased to report to the House that there continues to be excellent co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and public authorities. I continue to report regularly to Government on emergency planning, on a confidential basis.I presented the most recent of those confidential reports to Government last October. The report noted that the year had been one of consolidation of emergency planning development. Steps continue to be taken to build on the work done since 2001 to formalise the arrangements that have been put in place and to lay the groundwork for the future. The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency.As chairperson of the Government task force, my approach continues to be that such responses should be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements. I will continue this work, and I will report regularly to the Government and to this House on those matters.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	669	The Irish Presidency of the European Union was mandated to take forward implementation of the EU-UN joint declaration of 24 September 2003 on crisis management. In that context, Ireland as EU Presidency hosted a two-day seminar, on 11 and 12 May last, in Dublin. The theme of the seminar was "Synergy between the UN and EU Military Crisis Management".The seminar was aimed at military and civilian personnel engaged at the politico-strategic level in the area of military crisis management operations.The seminar covered the following aspects of military crisis management operations: parameters for operations; capacity building for operations; rapid response and effective operations.I was pleased to address the seminar on some key issues regarding the ongoing progress of ESDP and to have the opportunity to meet with participants.Keynote speeches were given by Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, UN Under-Secretary-General, department of peacekeeping operations, and Mr. Pieter Feith, Deputy Director-General for Politico-Military Affairs in the EU Council Secretariat.Participants included representatives from EU member states, the EU, UN and OSCE, the EU Institute of Security Studies, the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, Irish universities, the Institute for European Affairs, members of the Defence Forces and officials of both the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs.The seminar's objective was to explore possible means to enhance the synergy between the European Union and the United Nations in military crisis management. During our Presidency, discussions had been held at official level between the Presidency, the EU and the UN. As a result of those discussions with the UN, an agreed Presidency paper entitled "EU-UN Co-operation in Military Crisis Management Operations" will be presented to the European Council on 17 and 18 June, outlining the basis for further work on developing closer co-operation between the EU and UN in crisis management.

I expect that the move will take place later this year.Of the 23 staff currently serving with the civil defence board, 11 staff, in the following grades, have indicated a willingness to relocate to Roscrea: Director General — one; assistant principal — one; higher executive officers — five; executive officers — two, staff officer — one; and clerical officer — one.It is expected that formal applications will be sought shortly from civil servants in other Departments who wish to transfer to my Department to relocate to Roscrea and I am confident that all staffing requirements in the relocated offices will be met.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	671	On 15 January 2003 I approved, in principle, the report of the reserve Defence Forces review implementation board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the reserve, which had reported to me in September 1999.The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The reserve Defence Forces will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes will take place over a period of approximately six years.The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans within each brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report will ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the reserve Defence Forces. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of proposed newly amalgamated units but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake in the new enhanced reserve Defence Forces.Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the Reserve, a better overall organisation structure, and opportunities for suitably qualified Reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the reserve with the Army.I must emphasise I am very mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread.Planning is ongoing by the military authorities but no final decision on the amalgamation of FCA units will be taken until I have had the opportunity to examine and approve the final amalgamation proposals.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	672	The Garda Síochána has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. The potential threats to the State arising from international terrorism are continuously monitored by them in co-operation with the Defence Forces. The advice available to me at this time is, that, while the Garda authorities recognise that the terrorist threat to Europe may currently be high, in relation to Ireland it is low. Notwithstanding this, it is important that all prudent precautions are taken and that matters are kept under continuous review.The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the security of the State may be at risk. In addition, they have contingency plans in place as regards the provision of aid to the civil power — meaning in practice, to assist, when requested, an Garda Síochána — and the provision of assistance to the civil authorities in a range of emergency situations.An urgent and detailed review of capacities and procedures to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities following on from the events of 11 September. It included, inter alia, an up-date of the threat assessment; intensive contacts with other State agencies; and a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army ranger wing, ordnance and engineer assets in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search and a review of equipment including the need for air defence. Guidance documents pertaining to aid to the civil power and to the civil authorities were also re-assessed. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required.The capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with major emergencies is kept under constant review. Plans and procedures are updated as necessary and such additional equipment as is required to address any perceived deficiencies is acquired on the basis of identified priorities. Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the Defence Forces annual training plan. The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting members in dealing with nuclear, biological or chemical, NBC, threats identified from time to time.The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the director of operations and the director of ordnance. A programme for the purchase of NBC equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased expeditiously to meet the changing requirements.The Defence Forces hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements. In particular, a total of 8,000 new NBC suits have been acquired. In addition, the Defence Forces have sufficient stock of respirators for each individual soldier. They also have 98 of the most technologically up to date chemical agent monitors and Defence Forces personnel are being trained in their operation. Other equipment on hands includes biological agent detectors and screening kits as well as group decontamination and personal decontamination equipment. The most important defence against any attack is of course external vigilance, detection and prevention by the security forces. All the necessary resources of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are deployed to this end.

The Government decision on decentralisation also provides for the transfer of Defence Forces headquarters staff to the Curragh, County Kildare. Civil and military working groups have been set up to consider the practical aspects of the transfer of staff to Newbridge and the Curragh.The Deputy will also be aware that, in the context of the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided to decentralise the civil defence branch of my Department to Roscrea, County Tipperary. I expect that the move will take later this year.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 97 together.The Garda Síochána has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power — meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána — which duties include the protection and guarding of vital installations, the provision of certain security escorts etc.The level and demand for Defence Forces assistance depends on ongoing security assessments undertaken by the Garda. The Defence Forces and the Garda have ongoing consultations in relation to such issues as a matter of course.The Garda has requested the support of the Defence Forces for the impending visit of President Bush and for the EU-US Summit. Obviously, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific security arrangements as regards either event at this time. However, I can say that the Defence Forces will render such assistance as is deemed necessary and appropriate based on ongoing security assessments.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	675	I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 104 together.The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Clancy Barracks, Dublin, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, and Kildare.The sale of approximately 91 acres comprising Lot 1, Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, to O'Flynn Construction for €41 million was completed in 2003. In addition, the sale of Lot 2 to the sitting tenant for €1.05 million — my Department's reversionary interest in approximately 6.2 acres of the barrack lands — was also completed last year. Agreements have also been reached for the sale of a site, comprising approximately 2.7 acres to the Southern Heath Board and a further plot of approximately 1.7 acres to the Department of Education and Science; receipts in excess of € 2.8 million will accrue to my Department in respect of those disposals. An area comprising approximately 0.545 of an acre has been set aside on foot of a request from the Office of Public Works for a plot of ground to facilitate extension of the existing Garda station located on Main Street, Ballincollig. My Department is in correspondence with the OPW on arrangements for transfer of the lands concerned, including the matter of a consideration therefor.The sale of Clancy Barracks, Dublin, comprising 13.65 acres approximately to Florence Properties Limited for the sum of €25.4 million was completed in March 2004. Some 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, were sold to Cork County Council in 2001 for €973,889 for development in conjunction with the IDA.Castleblayney military post, Monaghan, comprising approximately ten acres, was sold to the North Eastern Health Board for €761,843. Seven acres at Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, were ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council, while a further 14 acres were sold to that authority for € 8,888,167. The balance of the barracks lands — one acre — was sold to Kildare County Council for €380,921.The Government decided on 1 July 2003 to release Magee barracks, Kildare to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for inclusion in a new affordable housing initiative agreed under the national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress.In recent years, there has been an unprecedented level of expenditure on infrastructure and equipment for the Defence Forces. This was made possible by the Government's decision that pay savings arising from the reorganisation of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper of 2000, along with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment. Over €174 million was spent on the capital investment programme for the upgrade of barracks, accommodation and other facilities between 1997 and the end of 2003. This year's Estimate for the Department of Defence includes a further €19 million for such capital works.Significant progress has also been made in recent years with the acquisition of modern equipment for the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service. This year sees the delivery of 25 additional armoured personnel carriers from Mowag of Switzerland, which will give the Defence Forces 65 Mowag APCs in total. The initial contract for 40 APCs saw deliveries completed by March 2002 and was valued at €51million inclusive of VAT. The value of the additional contract is some €33 million, inclusive of VAT with payments spread over the period 2002 to 2005, giving a total expenditure of €84 million on APCs. Eleven of the 25 APCs have already been delivered to the Curragh camp. The remaining 14 will be delivered by October 2004.The acquisition of light tactical vehicles, LTVs, for the Defence Forces will also be considered in the light of the ongoing budgetary situation. Another significant contract relates to the acquisition of the Javelin missile system from Raytheon-Lockheed Martin in the USA at a cost of some €13 million, inclusive of VAT. The purpose of this acquisition is to give Defence Forces personnel an effective, anti-armour capability while on peace support operations. The system will replace the Milan system. Some items under the contract have been delivered recently to allow for the training of personnel. The main delivery is scheduled for 2005.There have been ongoing programmes of acquisitions of both nuclear biological chemical, NBC, and night vision, NVE, equipment in recent years and these programmes will continue to meet the ongoing requirements of the Defence Forces.The main priority for the Air Corps has been the purchase of fixed wing training aircraft. In that regard, I signed a contract on 16 January 2003 for the supply of eight turbo propeller aircraft to replace the Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. These aircraft will allow for the continued training of young cadets to the highest standard and are a very realistic response to the needs of the Air Corps at this time. The new aircraft is the Pilatus PC-9M, manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft Limited, Switzerland. The cost of the eight aircraft is approximately €60 million. Seven aircraft have already been delivered and the remaining aircraft is currently in Austria for a weapons certification programme. While these aircraft are being obtained primarily for pilot training, they will be capable of being armed and as such will have a limited defensive capability.I have also announced the process to replace the ageing fleet of helicopters in the Air Corps. Following examination of the relevant issues, specifications have been prepared for light utility and utility helicopters and the tender competition has commenced for the supply of up to six aircraft. The closing date for the receipt of tenders is 23 July 2004.The Naval Service has also benefited from the investment programme in recent years with the acquisition of two new modern ships, LE Roisín and LE Niamh, at a cost of some €25 million each. The ships are proving to be a tremendous asset for the Naval Service in carrying out their day-to-day roles.

However, the Deputy will be aware that the central applications facility was recently launched by the Civil Service Commission. This facility will give all staff an opportunity to apply for the decentralised locations of their choice.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	677	By 31 May 2004 a total of 16,713 claims had been received in my Department from current and former members of the Defence Forces in respect of loss of hearing allegedly caused during their military service. Some 332 claims have been determined in court and 14,954 have been disposed of out of court, mainly through settlement, leaving a total of 1,427 claims outstanding at that date. The sum of €276 million has been paid in respect of hearing loss claims including €95.5 million in plaintiffs' legal costs.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	678	As I have previously outlined the chief of staff has received a submission from a retired Army officer who served at Jadotville seeking a review of the events of September 1961. The Chief of Staff arranged for the submission to be examined by a board of military officers.I have been informed by the chief of staff that he has recently received a report from the board of officers. Having examined the report, he has requested clarification on a number of matters. This clarification, which involves research of archival material, has been requested by 1 July 2004.Pending the outcome of the examination, it would not be appropriate for me to comment. I will carefully consider any recommendations that the chief of staff may make as regards this issue.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	679	I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 105 together.In December 2000 I authorised a new organisation for the Naval Service, which increased personnel numbers from 959 serving at that time to a new establishment of 1,144. The strength of the Naval Service, as advised by the military authorities, was 1,081 as at 30 April 2004. The Government remains fully committed to the policy of ongoing recruitment to ensure that both an overall PDF strength of 10,500 and the new Naval Service establishment figure of 1,144 are achieved and maintained.It is proposed to recruit ten cadets to the Naval Service from the 2004 cadetship competition. The Naval Service recently had an initial intake of 31 general service recruits. Earlier this year one direct entry marine engineer officer was recruited to the Naval Service. The requirements for any further intakes will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. The ongoing recruitment campaign for enlistment in the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address any shortfall in personnel in the Defence Forces including the Naval Service. Some 93 recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service in 2003; 14 cadets and eight direct entry officers were also recruited during 2003.Where the need arises, competitions are organised to recruit specialist personnel by direct entry. competitions have been advertised in recent years for marine engineer officers, watchkeeping officers, electrical engineer officers, electrical artificers and engine room artificers in the Naval Service.Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking and other such illegal activities rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners. The White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for both the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work. While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs — including the establishment in 1993 of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs and Excise and the Naval Service — have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking. The Air Corps provide air support and on occasion carry the customs national drugs team in an observation capacity, for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking or other such illegal activities.There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in this important area. I am satisfied that the extent of Naval Service and Air Corps reconnaissance, in conjunction with the Garda and the Customs and Excise, has had a major and beneficial impact in deterring drug trafficking and other such illegal activities.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	680	National sovereignty and voluntarism are the fundamental underlying principles of participation in the ESDP. For example, participation in any specific EU operation by member states is decided on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with respective national decision making procedures.Defence spending in EU member states remains a sovereign issue for each country and is usually undertaken in the context of ever increasing and competing demands for limited national resources.In seeking to improve the EU's capability to carry out peace support operations, I have advocated the necessity to focus on the qualitative aspects of capability development and on methods of improving efficiencies.In Ireland, the Defence Forces have benefited from such an approach which underscores the Government's White Paper on Defence published in February 2000. The White Paper set out a medium term strategy for defence covering the period up to 2010. A major objective of the strategy is to ensure that Ireland has a world-class military organisation capable of carrying out the roles assigned to it by the Government, both at home and abroad. This objective requires an ongoing modernisation process, including an investment programme to ensure that the Defence Forces are properly equipped for these roles.In the context of the broader development of the EU's capacity to carry out both civilian and military crisis management operations, I have continually advocated a similar approach to capability development. I believe that significant progress has been made in furthering the objectives of the EU in this regard during the Irish Presidency. The adoption by the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 17 May 2004 of a new "headline goal" with a horizon of 2010 has been a key development during our Presidency. In this regard, member states have decided to set themselves a new headline goal, reflecting the European security strategy adopted by the Heads of State and Government in Brussels in December 2003, taking into account the evolution of the strategic environment and drawing on lessons learned from previous EU-led crisis management operations.Another key development, on which I have reported in more detail in response to other questions today, has been the political agreement by the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 14 June to accept a joint action to establish an agency in the field of capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments. The agency's main aim will be to bolster efforts of the member states to support the EU's defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the ESDP as it stands now and develops in the future. I am hopeful that the agency will contribute to improvements in competitiveness and efficiencies in the defence equipment sector.I am pleased that my views in this regard are shared by many of my colleagues at EU level at a time when the majority of member states, including Ireland, have no plans to increase their defence spending.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	681	On 17 May last, I chaired a meeting of Defence Ministers in the framework of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Meetings in this format are normally held during each Presidency and complement the informal meeting of Defence Ministers that is also held during each Presidency. The meeting in May concentrated on some key items relating to the ongoing progress of EU security and defence policy during Ireland's Presidency. In particular we discussed the agreement for a new headline goal, with a horizon of 2010; the ongoing work towards the development of an EU rapid response capability, such as that which made a significant contribution to achieving peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2003; the ongoing work towards the establishment of an agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments, on which I have reported in more detail in response to earlier questions today; and the development of the relationship between the EU and NATO with particular regard to planning capabilities for civilian and military operations. I was pleased to be able to convey good progress on all of the issues to our Foreign Minister colleagues for inclusion in their General Affairs and External Relations Council conclusions.Our meeting was followed by a meeting between the EU Defence Ministers and the Defence Ministers of Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Norway and Iceland — the non-EU Members of NATO — which I also chaired. The meeting provided an opportunity to exchange views with the countries about the ongoing progress of EU security and defence policy in accordance with the ongoing implementation of constructive and transparent relations between the EU and NATO. I am pleased with the progress on EU security and defence policy achieved during our Presidency. I am confident that the Presidency report to the European Council on 17 and 18 June will reflect positively on this progress.

If work permit applications are complete and otherwise in order, they currently take eight to ten weeks to process. In the aftermath of EU enlargement, the Government's policy is to ensure that employers can source nearly all of their workforce needs from within the EU. Therefore, only in cases where exceptional levels of skill and qualifications are needed for the job, and the employer has made meaningful attempts to find EEA nationals, will my Department consider work permit applications.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	683	Apprentices are covered by the employment rights legislation administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with the exception of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003. The Act provides for permanency for fixed-term employees in certain circumstances. The nature of the apprenticeship relationship is essentially a temporary one, which does not involve permanency until the apprenticeship relationship has ended. It was not considered appropriate, therefore, to include apprentices within the remit of the 2003 Act. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to introduce new laws to improve the employment rights of apprentices.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	686	Ireland is contributing approximately 738 Defence Forces personnel to 21 missions throughout the world. The main commitments are to KFOR in Kosovo, with 213 personnel, and to UNMIL in Liberia, with 435 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the UN, the OSCE and the EU. Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the OSCE, the UN , NATO and the EU. Ireland reconfigured its commitment in the Balkans in the past year, replacing the existing SFOR military police platoon in Bosnia Herzegovina and the KFOR transport company with an APC mounted infantry company group in KFOR. The Defence Forces are serving as part of the Finnish-Irish battle group in a Finnish-led multinational brigade.A reorganisation and down-sizing of the NATO-led forces in KFOR was planned and had partly commenced when civil disturbances broke out in Kosovo in March of this year. The down-sizing has been deferred to allow the situation to settle. The withdrawal of the Irish contingent, which was planned as part of the down-sizing, was to have been completed by October 2004. Having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo and subject to ongoing assessments of the situation on the ground, however, Ireland will continue to maintain an appropriate presence in KFOR in 2004.Ireland's other current major contribution to peacekeeping is in Liberia. Along with an infantry group from Sweden, Ireland provides the rapid reaction reserve to the UNMIL Force Commander. Despite the difficult start to the mission, when Sergeant Derek Mooney of the Army ranger wing died tragically in a road accident, the mission is proving very successful. That Ireland was specifically asked by the UN to participate in a substantive manner in the mission is a tribute to the high regard in which the UN holds the Defence Forces. I welcome the participation of Sweden as part of the reserve. Such co-operation is reflective of the changing dynamics in peacekeeping. The range and diversity of arrangements in place for peacekeeping allows us to work in tandem with like-minded nations to contribute in an effective and meaningful manner in peace support operations throughout the world. Inter-operability with other forces has been a key factor in our involvement in PfP and our preparations over the past few years for the EU rapid reaction force. It is rewarding to see the effects of the hard work put in by the Defence Forces over the past number of years coming to fruition in such a positive manner, as part of the peace support role.I have stated that our participation in the Liberia deployment would be for two to three years. The 90th infantry battalion, which recently returned home having successfully completed a six-month tour of duty, has been replaced by the 91st infantry battalion, which has just begun a six-month tour of duty.We are looking forward to the take-over by the EU of the NATO-led mission in Bosnia Herzegovina in the next 12 months. Ireland has participated in its first EU mission, Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and it has a number of staff deployed at SFOR headquarters. Subject to the approval of the Government and Dáil Éireann and an appropriate UN mandate, I plan that Ireland will make a substantive contribution to the EU mission in SFOR, taking account of available resources and ongoing developments in the other peace support missions in which we are involved. At the request of the EU, I recently agreed to the appointment of an officer of the Permanent Defence Force to the new EU observer mission in Darfur, Sudan.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	688	The primary responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings and terrorist attacks rests with the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners, who are also responsible for the detention of persons and/or the seizure of drugs or equipment at sea. The White Paper on Defence gives the Naval Service and the Air Corps a security role in assisting and supporting the civil authorities in this important work. The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the EU.The Government has taken measures to improve drugs law enforcement, including the establishment in 1993 of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs and Excise and the Naval Service. Such measures have helped to maximise the effective use of the resources of the Naval Service in combating drug trafficking, etc. The Air Corps provides air support and sometimes carries the customs national drugs team in an observation capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking or other such illegal activities. The civil authorities — the Garda and the customs service — engage in close co-operation with the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission. I am satisfied that the extent of Naval Service and Air Corps reconnaissance measures, in conjunction with the Garda and the Customs and Excise, has had a major and beneficial impact in deterring drug trafficking and other such illegal activities.

This includes the protection of installations from terrorist attack. The question of the adequacy of resources in this regard is therefore a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in the first instance. The Defence Forces will continue to render appropriate assistance in the provision of aid to the civil powers as may be appropriate in specific circumstances when requested by the Garda.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	690	The White Paper on Defence, published in February 2000, sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 8,426 for the Army, 930 for the Air Corps and 1,144 for the Naval Service. I intend to maintain the Government's established policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at a level required to meet military needs, as set out in the White Paper — 10,500 personnel in the Permanent Defence Force among all ranks. It is envisaged that approximately 486 personnel will be recruited to the Permanent Defence Force in 2004, comprising general service recruits, cadets, Air Corps apprentices and direct entry personnel.

Payment of slaughter premium in respect of 75 animals has issued in full and national envelope top-up on beef breed heifers in respect of 17 animals has issued in full. As the slaughter records for the ten remaining animals were initially incorrect, eligibility under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme could not be established. As the records have since been amended and the animals concerned deemed eligible, however, payment under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme and the national envelope top-up in respect of the ten animals will issue shortly.

The Department of Agriculture and Food would not object if the person in question replaces his original transferee, provided the new transferee meets the relevant conditions of the early retirement scheme. The lease with the replacement transferee must be for a minimum period of five years. An eligible transferee must be in place for the payment of the pension to continue.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	693	The guidelines for the scheme in question have been drawn up and application forms have been prepared. The scheme requires formal EU approval as a state aid before it can proceed, however. The Department of Agriculture and Food is maintaining close liaison with the Commission in this regard. I am hopeful that approval will be forthcoming shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	694	The EU regulations governing the current scheme and the previous scheme, which was introduced in 1994, do not provide for indexation of rates of payment. The rate of pension payable under the 1994 scheme is the maximum provided for in the EU Council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The Department of Agriculture and Food's proposals for the current early retirement scheme, which commenced on 27 November 2000 and forms part of the CAP rural development plan for the period between 2000 and 2006, included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The European Commission rejected the Department's proposal and insisted that a fixed rate be set instead. The Department then proposed a rate that was the average of the scale initially proposed. This was acceptable to the Commission and is the rate provided for in the current scheme.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	696	The involvement of civil servants in politics is governed by the provisions of the Electoral Acts 1923 and 1992, the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 and various Civil Service circulars that set down the rules and guidelines in respect of the matter.All civil servants above clerical officer level are prohibited from joining a political party and from engaging in political activity generally. This prohibition is contained in the Department of Finance's circular 21/32, Civil Servants and Politics, which states:1. An official shall not be a member of an Association or serve on a Committee having for its object the promotion of the interest of a political party or the promotion or prevention of the return of a particular candidate to the Dáil.2. An official shall not support or oppose any particular candidate or party either by public speaking or writing.3. An official shall not make any verbal statements in public (or which are liable to be published), and shall not contribute to newspapers or other publications any letters or articles, conveying information, comment or criticism on any matter of current political interest, or which concerns the political action or positions of the Government or of any member or group of members of the Oireachtas.Civil servants at clerical officer and similar levels may apply to the head of the Department or office for permission to join a political party and to engage in political activity generally, including standing for election to a local authority. This provision is outlined in circular 7/99, Civil Servants as Candidates for Local Authority Elections. This approval is subject to the condition that the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Minister in charge of the particular Department or office, declare that officers engaged in a particular category of work may not stand for local authority election.Civil servants in the industrial and manual grades are free to join a political party and to engage in political activity generally, including standing for election to a local authority, under the terms of circular 7/99. No civil servant at any level is permitted to seek election to the Dáil or Seanad. Section 41(h) of the Electoral Act 1992 states that "a person who is a civil servant who is not by the terms of his employment expressly permitted to be a member of the Dáil shall not be eligible for election as a member or for membership of the Dáil". Section 11(2) of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 provides that "a person shall not be eligible for election to the European Parliament if the person is subject to any disqualification applicable to membership of the Dáil referred to in paragraphs f to k of section 41 of the Act of 1992”.In a decision of 26 July 2002 the Government decided that "all Ministerial and Attorney General Private Office staff holding temporary unestablished positions and whose tenure is coterminous with that of the relevant Minister/Attorney General be exempt from the general rules governing civil servants and politics". I consider that these long-standing arrangements are essential for the proper working of the Civil Service. I am sure Deputies will agree that it is in the public interest to ensure that civil servants are not involved in political activity and that they can offer impartial advice to all Governments. The independence of the Civil Service is an essential part of our democratic system.

The question of whether payments arise in a given situation under the provisions of the circular is a matter for local management. In the case of the Prison Service, it would primarily be a matter for the Prison Service, in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In the main, there are two types of subsistence allowance. The overnight rate, which is a maximum of €133.72, is available to officers who are absent at least 15 miles from their headquarters and must spend the night away. Overnight rates are designed to cover the cost of accommodation and three meals. Day subsistence rates are payable to civil servants who are at least five miles from their headquarters for at least five hours, at a maximum level of €15.45, or ten hours, at a maximum level of €37.90.

The outcome of these discussions gave rise to an estimate of €10.1 billion for the Department of Health and Children this year, an increase of 8% on the 2003 outturn. It is, for the most part, for the Minister for Health and Children to allocate these resources in whatever way he sees fit with regard to the provision of health services. In 2004, some €1.9 billion is being invested in services for persons with disabilities covering the intellectual, physical, sensory, autism and mental illness areas. This represents an increase of some €1.2 billion since 1997.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	699	I have no plans to provide for special treatment of swimming pools under the Valuation Act. The Valuation Act 2001 maintained the long-standing position that commercial facilities are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other useful services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist. Such a process could substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value, the rental value of the property. Any ratepayer dissatisfied with the rateability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal. There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.An amount of €15 million has been provided for in the Arts, Sport and Tourism Vote for 2004 in respect of grants for the provision and repair of swimming pools. This represents a 67% increase over the 2003 allocation of €9 million.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	700	Section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 requires financial institutions to take reasonable measures to identify their customers. Recommended procedures for the implementation of this provision are set out in guidance notes issued under the aegis of the money laundering steering committee, chaired by the Department of Finance and including representatives of financial services industry bodies, regulatory authorities and State agencies, including the Garda Síochána. The full text of the money laundering guidance notesfor credit institutions is available at http://www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/other/monlaun.rtf.Identification of a customer comprises name verification, typically evidenced by a photograph-bearing document such as passport, driving licence or other reputable source document, and address verification. Paragraph 28 of the guidance notes states that any measures adopted by credit institutions should not deny a person access to financial services solely on the grounds that he or she does not possess certain specified identification documentation. Paragraph 45 of the guidance notes provides for those persons who cannot reasonably be expected to produce certain forms of identification, such as a person who does not have a passport or driving licence and/or whose name and Irish address does not appear on a utility bill, electoral register or directory. These alternatives include an identification form with photograph signed by a member of the Garda, documentation or cards issued by a Department showing the name of the person, a letter or statement from a person in a position of responsibility such as a solicitor, accountant, doctor, minister of religion, teacher, social worker or a community employment scheme supervisor, who is in a position to confirm the person's identity to the credit institution.The EU savings directive, Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003, was transposed into Irish law by section 90 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Finance Act 2004 and also affects this matter. The directive provides for most EU member states to exchange information on the cross-border payment of interest to individuals resident in another member state. Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg will instead impose a withholding tax on such interest payments.Although the directive reporting obligations will not apply until after 1 January 2005, it imposes certain new obligations on paying agents making or securing an interest payment for an individual to establish the identity and residence of individuals who enter into a relationship with them on or after 1 January 2004. The identity and residence rules under the directive operate on two levels. First, where a paying agent has an on-going contractual relationship with an individual on 31 December 2003, the identity and country of residence will be established on the basis of whatever information is in the paying agent's possession. Second, as respects new contractual relations entered into on or after 1 January 2004, paying agents are required to establish the identity, consisting of the individual's name, address and tax identification number. In the absence of a tax identification number, the individual's date and place of birth and residence, consisting of the country where the individual has his or her permanent address, of individuals to whom they may make an interest payment on the basis of specific rules derived from the directive. These rules require that identity and residence be established on the basis of a person's passport or official identity card. Where any of this information is not recorded on such documents, it is to be established using any other documentary proof of identity presented.In implementing these rules contained in the directive, the Finance Act 2004 and the revenue guidance notes seek to be as flexible as possible in their approach so as to ensure that our obligations under the directive to provide information to other member states on interest payments made from Ireland to residents of those member states are fulfilled, while, at the same time, minimising the impact of the directive on both paying agents and those customers who would not be subject to the reporting requirements. To this end, the rules are applied in such a way so as to ensure that an Irish resident person who does not have a passport or an official identity card will be able to satisfy paying agents as to his or her identity and residence. In such cases, a current Irish driving licence or official documentation issued by the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Social and Family Affairs containing the person's name, address and personal public service number, which equates to a tax identification number in Ireland, are acceptable in the same way as an official identity card presented by a non-resident. In the case of Irish residents, including young persons who do not have any of the aforementioned documents, identity and residence may be established by reference to any photographic identification containing the person's name and address which is acceptable for money laundering purposes. In addition, parents who have their children added to their passports may use the information on the child in the passport as the basis for establishing identity. In such a case, residence may be taken to be that of the parent unless there is evidence to the contrary.There is no requirement either in the directive or the Irish implementing legislation that identity and residence information be acquired at account opening time or that an account should not be opened in the absence of the required details. However, it is likely that paying agents would wish to ensure compliance with their money laundering requirements and their obligations under the savings directive at the same time on the opening of the account. Notwithstanding this, there is a requirement on paying agents to update their records where an individual's details change at any stage.The purpose of these rules is to ensure that all customers of paying agents are correctly identified, along with their country of residence, so that when an interest payment is made to an individual who is resident in another EU member state, the details of the payment and the identity of the individual may be reported to the tax authorities in the appropriate member state. In order to minimise the opportunity for the misclassification of a non-resident as resident it is necessary that, broadly, the same rules apply to all customers of paying agents be they resident or non-resident.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	701	The Revenue Commissioners conducted on-site DIRT look-back audits on 37 financial institutions during 1999 and 2000. The focus of these audits was the DIRT position of the financial institutions concerned. In the course of this audit programme, many bogus non-resident deposit accounts that belonged to taxpayers were identified. At the conclusion of this audit programme, financial institutions made payments totalling €220 million to the Revenue Commissioners. These payments represented the DIRT, which should have been deducted together with the related interest and penalties. The Revenue Commissioners made a report on the matter to the Committee of Public Accounts which commented on the outcome of these audits in the final report on the DIRT inquiry, finalised on 3 April 2001. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that no evidence was seen in the course of the DIRT look-back audit programme that would support an investigation of an official of a financial institution with a view to prosecution.The Revenue Commissioners issued statement of practice SP-Gen 1/01 in May 2001, which set out a voluntary disclosure incentive scheme for taxpayers who held bogus non-resident deposit accounts and who wished to disclose and pay all their outstanding tax liabilities by 15 November 2001. This approach to the bogus non-resident account problem was extensively publicised at the time. Many taxpayers took the opportunity that was offered and payments of €227 million were made under the disclosure scheme.Inquiry work commenced on 16 November 2001 to identify taxpayers who choose not to avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme. Eighteen applications for High Court orders under section 908, TCA 1997 were applied for and have been granted. High Court orders made on financial institutions required them to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning the identities of account holders who held non-resident deposit accounts. This High Court order information is the principal basis for identifying holders of bogus non-resident accounts.Inquiry letters have been issued to taxpayers who have been identified in the section 908 High Court order information. This inquiry letter asks the taxpayer to whom it is addressed to disclose and pay all his or her outstanding tax liabilities within 60 days of the date of issue of the inquiry letter. To date since 15 November 2001 payments of €300 million have been made to the Revenue Commissioners by taxpayers who held bogus non-resident deposit accounts but who choose not to avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme. The Revenue Commissioners have not sought to initiate an investigation with a view to prosecution where the taxpayers concerned have fully co-operated. However, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that those who have not done so will face the prospect of a criminal investigation.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	703	Over the course of the Irish term of the EU Presidency, the EU has been to the forefront of the international community in promoting urgent action to address the appalling humanitarian and human rights situation in Darfur. At its meetings in April, May and June, the External Relations Council declared its serious concern at the humanitarian and human rights violations in Darfur and called on the Government of Sudan to provide unhindered and safe humanitarian access to the region. The European Union has been clear in its condemnation of the actions of the Janjaweed in Darfur. The EU has consistently conveyed the message to the Sudanese Government that it must take immediate action to adequately protect civilians against these violent militias.The Irish Presidency made the situation in Darfur the focus of the informal development Ministers' meeting held in Dublin on 1 June. The Ministers emphasised the issues of security, protection and humanitarian access in their discussions and called on the Sudanese Government, in particular, to adhere to the commitments entered into in the ceasefire agreement of 8 April.The EU and the UN continue to work closely together on the situation in Darfur. Most recently, the EU and UN hosted a successful high-level donors' consultative meeting in Geneva on 3 June, which was co-chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt. The meeting was attended by representatives of the Sudanese Government and the rebel groups operating in Darfur. Both parties heard the strong message from the EU, the UN, and others on the need for immediate and unrestricted access to Darfur for humanitarian agencies. We are extremely concerned at the gross human rights abuses reported by the acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, met with the Sudanese Government in Geneva and demanded that such human rights abuses be investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice.The donors' conference in Geneva was attended by 36 countries and a total of $125 million was pledged. The Government will continue to urge that all pledges be actually disbursed with minimum possible delay. In my Presidency capacity, I have encouraged EU member states that are also members of the UN Security Council to continue to push for a greater level of engagement by the Security Council on the issue of Darfur. In this regard, I welcome the adoption on 11 June of Security Council Resolution 1547 (2004) which condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Darfur and calls on the parties to the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement to conclude a political agreement without delay. I also welcome the presidential statement issued by the Security Council on 25 May and its clear call upon the Sudanese Government to respect its commitments as regards both neutralising and disarming the Janjaweed militias, as well as its call on the international community to support the efforts of the African Union in regard to Darfur.The European Union is working closely with the African Union to establish an African Union-led ceasefire commission and monitoring mission for the Darfur region. As EU Presidency, Ireland succeeded in assuring the establishment this past month of the EU's new African peace facility fund. Ireland then pressed for a quick release of EU funding for the African Union's initiative in Darfur. I am pleased that €12 million has been allocated to the Darfur Ceasefire Commission from the EU's African peace facility fund. The EU has been invited to contribute observers to the ceasefire monitoring mission and Ireland has put forward a candidate. The African Union will contribute both military and civil personnel.Sudan is a priority for Ireland's humanitarian assistance. To date, Ireland has committed €2.5 million to Darfur alone. These funds are being expended across a number of NGOs and humanitarian agencies to maximise their effect. Funding is also provided for the provision of food through the World Food Programme and life-saving activities such as shelter, water and sanitation through NGOs. Ireland has kept in close touch with aid agencies operating on the ground and has made representations to ensure that visas are issued expeditiously to Irish development workers. This serious and urgent situation will be monitored closely and we stand ready to assist further as the needs become clearer.

In the context of available funding and the number of applications received for that funding, it was not possible to approve all applications received and only those with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved.The application from the school referred to by the Deputy was not successful on this occasion. The school's need for accommodation will be considered in the context of a review which is being undertaken of all projects that did not proceed as part of the 2004 school building programme with a view to including it as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005, details of which will be announced later in the year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I can confirm that my Department has received an application for five hours resource teaching support and full time special needs assistant support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The position is that SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including an application for the pupil in question, are being considered. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September which were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the national educational psychological service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision.The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a recently announced new weighted system of allocation. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: first, making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and second, making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower prevalence special educational needs.It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed in consultation with representative interests. As soon as these are completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August 2003, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools shortly.

Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupils involved and the nature and level of the support provided is determined on the advice of the national educational psychological service. Special needs assistant support is generally made available where the student has special care needs.The school in question has been allocated 1.95 wholetime equivalent resource posts and 3.56 special needs assistant posts to cater for the special needs of students enrolled, including the student referred to by the Deputy. It is a matter for the school to deploy this allocation and also review this deployment in line with the evolving needs of the students.

This project is at stage three, developed sketch scheme, of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band one rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.This project is planned to progress to advanced architectural planning during 2004. Indicative timescales have been included for large-scale projects proceeding to tender in 2004. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme. This in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing to tender in this year's programme including the school referred to by the Deputy. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.

In addition, further funding was provided to schools, which did not have major capital investment to their science facilities since 1995. These grants have been paid to all schools, which notified my Department that they were opting into the revised syllabus.Coláiste Mhuire, Ballymote, made no application for grant aid under this scheme.All schools that did not apply for funding in 2003 were recently sent a circular — M42/04 — advising them how to apply for funding in 2004.The funding available to my Department for capital works in 2003 was finite and my Department was unable to sanction a project in 2003 to repair the gymnasium roof. The school did not apply for funding to repair the gymnasium roof as part of their application for funding under the summer works scheme in 2004.

In addition, an amount of €0.5 million has been made available in 2004 towards the implementation of the National Youth Work Development Plan 2003-2007.A significant proportion of this funding is expended each year on the special projects for youth scheme which specifically targets young people in disadvantaged areas. There are 164 special projects currently in receipt of funding under this scheme.Section 1 of the Youth Work Act 2001 allows for it to be implemented at various stages. To date, sections 2 to 7, 17, 18 and 24 have been commenced. A sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee was established to make recommendations on the requirements necessary for the implementation of the various sections of the Act. This sub-committee comprises representatives of both statutory and voluntary sectors as well as my Department. The work of the sub-committee is ongoing and preparatory work is also being carried out in regard to sections 19, 20 and 25 of the Act.The implementation of further sections of the Act will depend on the availability of necessary resources. It is my intention that further discussions will take place between my Department and the IVEA-CEO's association and the National Youth Council of Ireland in the context of the Estimates for 2005. These discussions will take place as appropriate and necessary.I am aware of the issues and concerns in the youth work sector regarding future funding for both the ongoing support for youth work programmes and services and the further implementation of the Act and to this end I will continue to seek funding through the Estimates process for 2005.

I hope to announce the outcome of this review shortly.In relation to the third point of the details supplied, the Deputy is already aware that the school in question currently has the services of a full-time learning support post shared with another school. At present there are approximately 1,531 learning support teachers in the primary system.My Department continues to review the existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. The basic purpose of the review is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.I am anxious to ensure that the support services are properly targeted at the children who require them and that the substantially increased resources which are being made available in the special educational area have the desired effect of ensuring that all children assessed as having special educational needs receive the support they require.The Deputy is also aware that my Department is currently developing a weighted system of allocation of teaching support for schools to cater for pupils with special needs, including those requiring learning support teaching. The details of this system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, have been outlined to the Deputy in my response to Question No. 193 on 18 May 2004.

This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools shortly.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	725	I can confirm that my Department has received an application for special needs assistant support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy.The position is that applications for special educational resources, SER, received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision.The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits.

The project was approved in principle for funding of €1.27 million in June 2001, subject to a number of conditions being met by the applicant, Sligo County Council. The county council has yet to obtain the necessary foreshore lease and to accept certain legal undertakings in the form of a deed of covenant, which are standard requirements in a capital project of this type. As soon as these items are dealt with satisfactorily, the grant may be formally approved.While the grant funding is identified in my Department's Vote for 2004, it is a matter of concern that the project is still not in a position to commence.

The aim is to ensure that the resulting framework will ensure that the Loughs Agency can fulfil its responsibilities under the British-Irish Agreement Acts to develop and license aquaculture in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough in a fully sustainable way.Efforts continue by my Department to finalise the drafting of that part of the Foyle Carlingford Fisheries Bill for which the Department has responsibility so as to facilitate publication by the end of this year.

Air rescue services are provided by four helicopter units located one each at Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo airports. Sea rescue services are provided by means of agreements with a number of resources. These resources are crewed by volunteers and are located around the coast. They include 54 Coast Guard units, 49 Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, lifeboats and nine community inshore rescue boats.For air rescue, the average take-off time following call-out by the Coast Guard between the hours of 07.30 and 21.00 is 12 minutes and, following call-out between the hours of 21.00 and 07.30, is 42 minutes.For sea rescue the average times to launch following call-out by the Coast Guard are as follows: for Coast Guard units to leave their Station House, 12 minutes; for RNLI lifeboats to launch, 11 minutes; and for community inshore rescue boats to launch, 11 minutes.The Coast Guard carries out daily incident reviews on all SAR incidents and monitors response times of all declared SAR assets as part of this process. SAR response times form a key performance indicator for the Coast Guard.

Funding of €3.9 million has already been provided to the Western Health Board to allow for the opening of the orthopaedic service at Mayo General Hospital.Currently one consultant orthopaedic surgeon has been recruited by the Western Health Board and took up duty on 1 February 2004. The Western Health Board has informed me that discussions between the orthopaedic staff in Galway and Mayo are continuing in an effort to configure the best use of the facilities at Galway and Mayo. These discussions are taking place within a framework to develop an overall integrated strategic and operational policy for orthopaedic services in the region.As I have outlined above, substantial funding has already been provided to commission orthopaedic services at Mayo. The Western Health Board is currently in discussion with my Department in relation to commencing orthopaedic services at Mayo General Hospital, particularly in relation to the effect the additional staffing required to commence services will have on the board's current employment ceiling.I am committed to ensuring that the new orthopaedic services are established at Mayo General Hospital at the earliest possible date.

These needs arise as a result of the changing profile of persons with an intellectual disability or those with autism in the services, and in particular the residential services, which has resulted in an increasing number of older and medically fragile persons. They would also relate to issues such as underfunding of base budgets, including the need to consolidate elements of services previously funded from sources such as fundraising. My Department has sought over the years to address these issues as resources have permitted. Between 1998 and 2002, additional revenue funding amounting to €27 million was allocated to services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism to meet identified needs in existing services, including those provided by Moore Abbey. The Harmon report referred to by the Deputy would be included in this category.My Department has identified both this need and the requirement for new service developments in the context of Estimates discussions with the Department of Finance over the years. These discussions have resulted in the additional revenue funding which I have mentioned. However, the overall economic position in 2003 and 2004 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and this was reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for those years. The funding allocated to the health services has been applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes.Service provision for people with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities and those with autism is one of the limited number of areas in which additional revenue funding has been provided by the Government in any Department over 2003 and 2004. In respect of services to persons with intellectual disability and autism, this revenue funding, amounting to €43 million up to the end of 2004, was specifically provided to meet costs associated with the provision of emergency residential placements, extra day places, particularly for young adults leaving school, and to enhance the health related support services for children.While my Department has been made aware of this issue, it is a matter in the first instance for the agency and the relevant health boards, namely, the South Western Area Health Board and the Midland Health Board, as it relates to service provision.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	740	Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and/or their dependants, such as seriously ill children, without undue hardship. Details of the medical card scheme, and other public health care entitlements, are published on my Department's website, and on the Government Oasis website. They are also available from each health board.Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the health board-authority chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility for a medical card and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index, CPI. However, it should be noted that the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.For those who do not qualify for a medical card there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the 1970 Health Act, a health board may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition for the treatment of that condition under the long term illness, LTI, scheme. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness — for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. A person with an eligible condition, or their parent, should contact their local health board in order to register under the scheme. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his or her dependants will not have to pay more than €78 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the CEOs, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify that.

This gives entitlement to drive vehicles having a design gross vehicle weight exceeding 3,500 kg, and having passenger accommodation for not more than eight persons. The minimum age at which application can be made for such a licence is 18 years.

The requirements are set out in the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 and the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003.The regulations specify requirements, inter alia, in relation to braking efficiency and maximum weights. In addition, passenger and goods vehicles are subject to periodic roadworthiness testing, goods vehicles being subject to test when they are one year old and annually thereafter.Vehicles that do not comply with the requirements in respect of maximum weight, maximum dimensions, suspension, wheels and tyre characteristics may be used in a public place provided that they are covered by a special permit under regulation 59 of the 2003 regulations. Such permits may be issued by local authorities and may include conditions limiting the use of the vehicles to particular places or routes. Applicants for permits are required to give an undertaking to refund to the local authority in question the cost of repairing any damage caused to any public road by the use of a vehicle for which a permit is issued. Vehicles which are the subject of permits must comply with all construction, equipment and use standards that are not specifically qualified in the permits. Permits may not include provisions that would result in the use of a defective vehicle.My Department is engaged in a consultative process with a view to amending the permit scheme so that it is more effective in road safety and operational terms. As part of that process, consideration is being given to making any permit granted in respect of an off road dumper subject to an inspection and certification process to ensure that the condition of the vehicle is not a road safety hazard.

Testing conducted in the Carrick-on-Shannon, Longford and Athlone testing centres, which are adjacent to the county, also covers the general area of County Roscommon. Accordingly, I understand that the mobile theory testing unit does not visit Roscommon town.Theory test appointments are arranged by the driver theory testing service and not by my Department. The service may be contacted at LoCall number 1890606106 regarding details of test arrangements.A key performance standard contained in the customer charter for the driver theory testing service is that tests are to be offered at centres undertaking more than 250 tests per annum within two weeks of a candidate's preferred date.

Records of licences issued are held on the national driver file, which is a central record held by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Computer databases and records of licences issued were held by each licensing authority until they were transferred to the national driver file two years ago. It remains the responsibility of the licensing authorities to ensure that the licence record is updated when new licences are issued.A person who has lost a driving licence may apply for a duplicate licence by completing statutory form D 800, which is available at licensing authorities. Where the licensing authority is satisfied that the driving licence has been lost, destroyed or mutilated it may, on payment of a fee of €5, issue a duplicate licence.A licensing authority may only issue a driving licence if it receives, inter alia, a certificate of competency from an individual or proof that that individual was already entitled to a driving licence. In the absence of such documentation, the law precludes the licensing authority from issuing a driving licence or a duplicate driving licence.Where a licensing authority has no record of a person having held a licence, a person may submit to the licensing authority, in support of their application for a further licence, any evidence they might have that they held a driving licence and the categories of licence they held.

I also understand that recent practice under the scheme has been to provide pension increases in line with the consumer price index to pensions in payment. These increases are not guaranteed and are not explicitly funded but depend on the performance of the pension fund and are paid at the discretion of the trustees of the scheme.I do not propose to change long standing policy in this area, that is, that pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, including Aer Rianta, are a matter for the trustees, the members of the relevant scheme and the company involved. The State has no involvement in the funding of these schemes.

It would also appear that she has been unlawfully employed during that period.She has very recently made an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of her marriage to an Irish national. Applications of this type are dealt with in strict chronological order, in fairness to all applicants, and are currently taking approximately 12 months to process.There is no objection on my part to her travelling home to China. However, it is not the case that by virtue of her desire to visit home I will move her application for permission to remain in the State to the top of the queue. All applicants for permission to remain in the State can advance the same argument, that is, they cannot leave Ireland where they are unlawfully resident because they are not guaranteed re-entry. The reality is that if she had complied with our immigration laws in the first place this situation would not have arisen.

A worker employed under this scheme may be joined by their spouse and minor children after the worker has been in the State for one year and has been offered a contract for a further year. The worker must also be able to fully support the family members in question without the need to have recourse to public funds. The application in question was refused as the supporting documentation did not show that the worker was in a position to fully support her daughter. The worker in question did not enclose up to date payslips as evidence of her income.It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department. Any appeal should include payslips as evidence of income.

The Deputy should note that, to date, only two institutions have been mothballed, namely, the Curragh and Fort Mitchel.In so far as the Irish Prison Service is concerned, the payment of travel and subsistence is governed by the provisions of Department of the Public Service Circular 11/ 82. It is a matter for each Department to determine whether it would be appropriate to make travel and subsistence payments to their staff in any particular situation. Accordingly, in relation to temporary transfers from Fort Mitchel and the Curragh, it has been decided that subsistence payments relating to breakfast, dinner or tea allowances will not be paid as the costs of same would normally be incurred by the officer in any event.Furthermore, mileage expenses are to be at the lower rate and the payment of this will be reviewed on a regular basis. For the purposes of clarification, where an officer travels from home to the prison of temporary transfer he or she will qualify for mileage, at the lower rate, based on the lesser of the distance from home to the prison of temporary transfer or the distance from their normal prison to the prison of temporary transfer, except that if any part of the journey from home to the prison of temporary transfer covers part of the usual route from home to his or her normal prison, this portion will not qualify for payment of mileage, that is, mileage is only payable for that part of the journey after the officer leaves his or her normal route to work to their normal prison.Staff on a 12 hour shift who decide not to travel from home to and from work each day will be entitled to claim overnight subsistence — this will be reduced by the breakfast, dinner and tea rate — on the following basis: subsistence will be at the normal rate for 14 calendar days, €74.60 per night; reduced rate for the next 14 calendar days, €63.80 per night; and detention rate for the next 28 calendar days, €37.32 per night. The above arrangements are being kept under review.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-16 00:00:00	Prelude	768	People in receipt of deserted wife's benefit were not eligible originally to participate in community employment, CE, schemes operated by FÁS. Access to CE was restricted to those on unemployment payments or the means-tested lone parent's allowance.Following a review of the CE scheme, it was decided in December 1994 that persons in receipt of deserted wife's benefit, who had dependant children, could participate on a CE scheme if they transferred to lone parent's allowance. It is estimated that approximately 600 deserted wife's benefit recipients transferred to the lone parent's allowance for CE purposes.In October 2000, the qualifying conditions for participation on CE schemes were changed to allow deserted wife's benefit recipients direct access to CE schemes without having to switch to lone parent's allowance.Deserted wife's benefit recipients who transferred to a lone parent payment for CE purposes prior to October 2000 have their entitlement to deserted wife's benefit re-assessed when they notify my Department that they have ceased the CE scheme. If they still have an entitlement to deserted wife's benefit, that payment is restored to them. The Department also assesses in each case whether any arrears of benefit are due to cover the difference between the rates of deserted wife's benefit and the one-parent family payment they received during the period that they were on the CE scheme.I am also arranging for my Department, as soon as possible, to review the entitlements of deserted wives who transferred to lone parent allowance prior to 2000 in order to access a CE scheme and who are still on CE so that any retrospective entitlements they may have can be paid.
