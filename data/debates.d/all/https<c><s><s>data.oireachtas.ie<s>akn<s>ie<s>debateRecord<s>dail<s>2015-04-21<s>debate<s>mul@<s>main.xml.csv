#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	1	In May 1974 the single greatest act of carnage in the period known as the Troubles on our island resulted in the deaths of 44 innocent people from Dublin city and Monaghan town.The Dáil, in 2008 and 2011, unanimously passed a motion requesting the British Government to give an international eminent legal person access to papers and files relating to those bombings. Unfortunately, to date, the British Government has not reacted positively to a call from a sovereign Parliament. Will the Minister ensure that he raises again with members of the British Government, at every opportunity he has, the need for it to respond positively to those calls by Dáil Éireann to release those papers and progress those investigations into the desperate and evil deeds that occurred in May 1974?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	2	I acknowledge Deputy Smith's long-standing interest in this matter. I assure him and the House that the Government fully supports the all-party Dáil motions of July 2008 and May 2011 urging the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents in its possession relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. I have raised this issue with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers MP, including when I met her in Belfast in January of this year and in Dublin in February. I am aware and I welcome that Deputy Smith and his party leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, raised this matter with Secretary of State Villiers when they had the opportunity to meet her in February also. The Secretary of State has indicated to me on a number of occasions that the British Government would consider afresh how it can respond to these Dáil motions. I welcome the continued all-party support for the campaign on behalf of the Dublin and Monaghan families. The Justice for the Forgotten campaign, which supports victims and their families and operates as a project of the Pat Finucane Centre, received grant support of almost €50,000 in 2014 from the reconciliation fund operated by my Department. The funding will assist Justice for the Forgotten with its important work. I am aware that my officials will be meeting with representatives of Justice for the Forgotten in Belfast tomorrow in regard to the provisions for dealing with the past in the Stormont House Agreement. Indeed, I would hope to have the opportunity to meet with Justice for the Forgotten over the coming weeks, and I am conscious in that regard that the anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings falls on 17 May next. I accept that anniversaries can be a particularly difficult time for the families of victims and for survivors, and the Dublin and Monaghan families are in my thoughts as we discuss this most sensitive of issues in the House today. I wish to assure Deputy Smith of my ongoing interest.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	3	I thank the Minister sincerely for his interest. I keep raising this issue because we want to assure the families of the victims, and victims themselves, that we are determined, as a Parliament, to ensure proper and full investigations are carried out. Before the 41st anniversary of these awful deeds, a new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will probably have been appointed by a new British Government. Will the Minister give us an assurance that, in his first engagement with the new Secretary of State or with members of the new British Government, he will raise this as a particular subject on which we need progress? It is absolutely unacceptable that there has not been a positive response by the British Government to the ongoing work of successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade and successive Governments, and the unanimous motions passed by this House on two separate occasions. I hope the Minister will raise this with the new incumbent, whatever party that person belongs to.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	4	I assure Deputy Smith that I will continue my efforts in order to ensure this issue can be progressed. On his recent visit to Belfast, the Taoiseach made clear the importance which this Government attaches to the issue of disclosure and co-operation in dealing with the legacy of the past. For the Irish Government and other State authorities, this means committing to co-operating to the fullest possible extent with all of the many legacy cases. In this context, I assure Deputy Smith that I will continue to call on the British Government to provide access to an independent international judicial figure and to original documents in its possession relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. I propose to take this matter up at an early date, once a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has been appointed following the upcoming elections to Westminster. Before the 41st annuiversary of these awful deeds, a new Secregtary of State for Northern Irelzand will probably have been appointed by a new British Government
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	5	The Minister acknowledged the engagement Deputy Micheál Martin and myself have had with the Secretary of State.We also engaged with the Labour Party spokesperson for Northern Ireland, Mr. Lewis MP.  As the Minister knows, the Barron report is extremely important. Mr. Justice Henry Barron found grounds for suspecting that the bombers may have had help from members of the British security forces. Likewise, with regard to the atrocity in Monaghan town, the UVF claimed responsibility. There is a body of evidence which points in one direction in regard to where the responsibilities for these murders rest. If the British Government is not forthcoming at an early date in responding positively to the request of this House, will the Government consider initiating legal action against the British authorities?

I acknowledge the contribution, help, assistance and influence of the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Smith not just recently, but over a long period of time. I assure the Deputy that, in the context of my deliberations, my Department has a long-standing relationship with the Justice for the Forgotten group. We have had several meetings with it, both at official and ministerial levels. I would be happy, as I said in my reply, to have an opportunity to meet it and I undertake to take up the matter in a vigorous and vociferous way as soon as the new Secretary of State is appointed, following the election in Britain on 7 May.

He has been in jail for the past 600 days and we all hoped he would have been released and back home in Ireland by now. We all agree he will not get a fair trial in Egypt, considering the political situation there. Up to now there have been mass show trials and no real legal proceedings. Can the Minister give an update on what support the Irish embassy is giving to Ibrahim and his family. I talked to the family last week and they were worried about the fact he had been moved and they had no knowledge about what was happening.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	8	Our objectives in this case are clear - first, to see the release of this individual by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return home to his family and his studies in Dublin and second, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. This considered approach and sustained action that has been taken by me and my officials in this case has been to further these objectives at all times and to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to his best interests. It is important to bear in mind the role of the Irish Government where citizens are imprisoned abroad. Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release. The decision to release this individual, either on bail or on any other basis, will be a decision that is made solely by the authorities in Cairo. Since this citizen was originally detained in August 2013, I and officials in my Department, including our ambassador in Cairo, have raised this case with the Egyptian authorities regularly and consistently. In addition, he has received consular visits from embassy official on 37 occasions to date. I can confirm that the Irish Government has formally supported both the application by this citizen’s lawyers for his release and return to Ireland under the November presidential decree and the more recent application for his release on bail. Our official support for this citizen’s release has been duly communicated to the authorities in Cairo in formal diplomatic notes that have been included in the documentation submitted to the court and the authorities by his lawyer. I have spoken to my Egyptian counterpart on numerous occasions, both in person and on the telephone. On 4 March I met with Assistant Foreign Minister Badr and discussed the case with him in some detail. On 2 April I spoke again with my Egyptian counterpart, Mr. Shoukry, to underline the Irish Government’s commitment regarding the formal applications that have been made for this individual’s release.

I do not believe the individual will get a fair trial. He is being held in appalling conditions. He is not safe, he is vulnerable and his human rights have been violated. He was 17 when he was arrested, and he has been detained for the past two years. His health and mental condition are clearly deteriorating. We saw the release of al-Jazeera journalists. We were told the Australian and Canadian Prime Ministers had contacted the Egyptian President, Mr. el-Sisi, which helped to secure their citizens' release. Has the Minister contacted the Australian and Canadian embassies to find out more about the process they used, the levers they pulled and the buttons they pushed to secure the release of their citizens? Does he believe that, before the next court appearance, the Taoiseach should contact President el-Sisi personally in an attempt to secure Ibrahim's release?

Having spoken at some length to the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Julie Bishop, and to my Canadian counterparts, I am well briefed on the facts of their cases and how they differ from the circumstances of the Irish citizen involved and the approach taken by their countries. Having had those conversations, I am fully satisfied that the actions we are currently taking in pursuit of our objectives in this case are totally appropriate and focused on the best interest of the individual involved and, equally important, are more likely to facilitate a positive outcome.

I raised this personally with her. Ms Boylan raised the point that Egypt is in breach of Article 2 of its Euro-Mediterranean trade agreement, which states that relations between the parties "shall be based on respect of democratic principles and fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which guides their internal and international policy". It is clear, therefore, that Egypt is not living up to its side of this agreement. Has the Minister discussed this breach with his European counterparts? Are they aware of what is happening to this EU and Irish citizen, and has the Minister encouraged them to raise the breach with the Egyptian Government on behalf of EU citizens?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	12	Once again, I assure the House that I am fully aware of the frustrations and sensitivities involved. I am also aware of comparisons being made between the case of this individual and other cases involving foreign nationals. I assure the Deputy that I have on numerous occasions discussed the case with Ms Mogherini, as recently as last week. I can confirm to the House that I have been in contact with Members of the European Parliament. I wish to refute an inaccurate suggestion that when foreign nationals were released it was solely on the basis of calls by foreign ministerial offices, foreign Prime Ministers or foreign Ministers. I assure the House and wish to make it quite clear that it is the Egyptian authorities alone who will decide on the matter of the release of our citizen. Notwithstanding that, I assure Deputy Crowe that I am consistently involved in seeking avenues that I believe are appropriate to secure the release of this citizen.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	13	I, too, want to raise the case of Ibrahim Halawa, an Irish citizen who is a prisoner of conscience according to Amnesty International. The case is extremely urgent, as the next hearing will be in five days. It is obviously accurate that the decision on whether to release Ibrahim will be made by the Egyptian authorities, but what is problematic is the idea that Egyptian law applies. There is no rule of law, in reality, in Egypt, and there is no justice available to Ibrahim. Does the Minister agree that the maximum pressure has to be applied, including directly by the Taoiseach, on the Egyptian authorities?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	14	I assure Deputy Murphy that my objectives in the case are appropriate and clear. They are to see the release of the individual by the authorities in Cairo so he can return home to resume his studies in Dublin and be with his family, and to provide support for his welfare while he remains detained. The approach I continue to take on an almost daily basis is in furtherance of these objectives. It is important to note again, and forgive me if I repeat it, with regard to the role of the Irish Government where citizens are detained abroad, irrespective of any views regarding the fairness of the trial or the circumstances, political or otherwise, in the jurisdiction where the person might be detained, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence or offences under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that is applicable and it is the relevant foreign court which decides on these matters and all matters such as bail, evidence and continued detention or release. Notwithstanding this, there are circumstances associated with this case which warrant a return home of the individual and I assure the House of my continued interest in this regard. It is a matter solely for the authorities in Cairo. Deputy Murphy suggested there are a number of days before the trial and this is correct. The return date is towards the end of this week. In line with our clear objectives in the case, our approach is consistently under review. I am keeping the Taoiseach fully briefed and it may be that at a certain stage it would be beneficial to the citizen for the Taoiseach to become involved. I have not ruled this out as a possibility. The hearing dates, return dates and the dates on which evidence is tendered are entirely, solely and exclusively a matter for the courts in Egypt.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	15	I urge the Minister and the Government to go with the option of the Taoiseach intervening. In five days time Ibrahim could be sentenced to death. Yesterday, 22 people were sentenced to death for participation in a protest. There is no chance of him receiving justice in what is a mass trial. The Minister recognised the reality that the Egyptian authorities will decide, but the nature of these authorities is that there is a counter-revolutionary dictatorship in Egypt which is drowning revolution in blood. This is what is happening through an act of mass trials and execution. An Irish citizen is caught up in this. None of the other peaceful protesters should be caught up in it either. The Government must do everything it can, and surely this includes the Taoiseach intervening. I do not see how the Taoiseach intervening could have a negative impact on Ibrahim's prospects.

It would be most unhelpful for me or anybody else to speculate as to what might happen on that occasion. I assure the House and Deputy Murphy that Irish embassy officials will be in attendance as they have been at every hearing of this trial to monitor, experience and report on developments of the day. There is a specific application before the courts for the release of the individual on bail. This is being considered by the judge. Inappropriate escalation of political intervention, however well-intentioned it might be, could be counter-productive to our objective in the case and could be counter-productive to the best interests and welfare of the citizen involved. We are keeping matters under review and I am happy to keep the Deputy fully informed of developments.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	17	I welcome the fact that people from the embassy will be in attendance and monitoring and I accepted the intentions of the Government are not to harm Ibrahim in any way, but at this stage what is needed is the highest possible level of political intervention. Of course there are differences in other cases, but was high level political intervention a factor in the case of the Australian citizen, Peter Greste, and the Canadian citizen, Mohammed Fahmy?In the last couple of days the family did not know what prison he was in, as mentioned by Deputy Crowe. They went to another prison and he was not there, but when they went back to the first prison they found he had been moved. According to his family, he showed signs of physical abuse. We need the maximum possible intervention to pressurise the authorities.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	18	I again express concern at the inaccurate reporting the circumstances of the individual. There were allegations of torture, which were taken seriously and investigated by my Department and me. There was a suggestion in the form of a report that he was missing in prison. That did not transpire to be the case. While the individual remains in detention, a key objective for me is that we do what we can to protect his welfare and well-being and ensure prison conditions for him are as good as can be under the circumstances. Following an intervention by the ambassador, the individual involved is no longer sharing a cell with convicted criminals and is now accommodated with other remand detainees. This is not a negative development. He is in a different area of the prison from most of his co-accused. In addition to regular consular visits, our embassy in Cairo is in ongoing contact with the prison authorities and the relevant ministries to ensure the citizen's conditions are as good as possible. We will continue to raise any issues through all appropriate channels.

It is an important mechanism to advance a number of outstanding issues, including identity, the need for welfare reform to meet the needs of the less well-off, and making Government finance in Northern Ireland more sustainable. Many of the issues are ones we do not have the luxury of allowing to fester. Can the Minister provide an update on the progress made in the four months since signing of the agreement in advancing these issues?

In accordance with the review and monitoring provisions of the agreement, the second quarterly review meeting, involving the Northern Ireland Executive party leaders and the British and Irish Governments, took place in Belfast on 27 March, where I represented the Government. We reviewed progress made to date on the detailed implementation timeline which was agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive party leaders and the two Governments at our first review meeting on 30 January last. I am pleased to report that significant progress is being made in many of the areas specified in the implementation timeline, including complex work on the establishment of the institutions for dealing with the past. However, I am disappointed that difficulties have recently arisen with regard to the welfare element of the Stormont House Agreement. It is important to ensure that these developments do not have a corrosive impact on the wider implementation of the agreement. That is why the Government has encouraged all parties to stand back and consider the overall potential benefit for the people of Northern Ireland offered by the Stormont House Agreement and to ensure that its potential is fully achieved. The next review meeting of the agreement is scheduled to take place in June. A six-monthly update on progress on the implementation of the agreement is due to be published at that time in accordance with the review and monitoring provisions of the agreement. The Government remains committed to playing its part in ensuring the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement within the timeframe agreed.

Is it assumed that no progress will be made on these issues due to the fact that the Westminster elections are taking place on 7 May? Has the Minister asked the Sinn Féin Party why it decided to backtrack on the initial agreement about welfare reform to which it signed up on 23 December? With regard to the devolution of responsibility for parades to the Assembly, has devolution taken place or is it intended to take place in 2015? The parade season will be upon us.

I point specifically to the areas of agreement involving the preparation of legislation, north and south of the Border and in Westminster. I assure the House in particular that legislation incumbent on the Irish Department of Justice and Equality is progressing and I am in constant contact with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. I reiterate my disappointment that difficulties have arisen around the welfare element of the Stormont House Agreement. Deputy Smith makes particular reference to one of the parties involved, namely, Sinn Féin. I have discussed this issue with Sinn Féin. I have strongly expressed the view that the implementation of all the provisions of the agreement are important, and I will continue to do so. I regret that difficulties have arisen in this area.

By definition, it will deal with issues that are decades old. Many of the families affected by murders that were never properly investigated are getting to an age at which they are concerned that they will never see a thorough investigation into the murders of, and in many cases the injuries inflicted on, family members. I welcome the Minister's statement that legislation is being advanced. I appeal to him to make sure that both the Department of Justice and Equality and his own Department ensure that a number of cases that have been referred to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland are forwarded to the historical investigations unit when it is established and its work is under way. There are a number of cases in my constituency and elsewhere where there is evidence that the atrocities emanated from north of the Border and there have never been full investigations. This is the last chance to get some investigation, which is so much needed by those families.

Ongoing discussions on these matters take place primarily between the Northern Ireland Executive party leaders themselves, but on numerous occasions I have called on the parties in Northern Ireland, especially Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party, to work together to find a solution to the current difficulties on welfare and budgetary issues. I acknowledge Deputy Smith's interest in the historical investigations unit over many years. I assure him that progress is proceeding on the matter of the new independent body, which will have full policing powers. This will take forward investigations into Northern Ireland on matters relating to outstanding deaths from the Troubles, including outstanding cases from the PSNI's historical inquiries team and the legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. Regarding the specific atrocity referred to by the Deputy, it is my clear understanding that all outstanding cases before the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland will be transferred to the historical investigations unit.

Those killings have given rise to the Black Lives Matter movement in the US and they point to a systemic racism in the US state and police force. Has the Minister raised this issue, or will he raise it, with his US counterparts?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	27	I am aware of recent reports of alleged police-led human rights abuses against African Americans in the US and the extensive public concern created by those allegations. These concerns, and the need to address them, have been acknowledged by the US authorities at the highest level. President Obama stated in an address to the US people in November, following the decision of the grand jury in the Michael Brown case:The fact is, in too many parts of this country, a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of colour. Some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country. ... The good news is we know there are things we can do to help. And I’ve instructed Attorney General Holder to work with cities across the country to help build better relations between communities and law enforcement.The US authorities at the federal, state and municipal level, and a range of widely respected US human rights and law reform NGOs, are seized of these cases and the broader issues they raise, and there is extensive and detailed reporting of these controversies in the media. As I mentioned, President Obama and the Attorney General, Eric Holder, have taken initiatives to address some of the broader societal issues, as well as to address the specific recent cases. In the most recent case in South Carolina, the police officer involved has been charged with murder. The US has a robust democracy and a respected legal system, and I expect it will continue to deal with such cases in an open and transparent way. I am very conscious that people in all parts of the world continue to suffer discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, descent, nationality or ethnic origin. Ireland is firmly committed to the principle of non-discrimination and is a party to the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. I therefore fully support President Obama and his Administration's efforts to address the concerns raised by these recent incidents and to build improved relations and trust between US law enforcement and all communities around the US.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	28	I will also quote President Obama, who said "What happened in Ferguson may not be unique, but it's no longer endemic or sanctioned by law and custom". It is endemic. A report by the US Department of Justice found a pattern of civil rights violations by the Ferguson police department and points to shocking statistics. Some 90% of people who received a citation in Ferguson were African American, and 95% of manner of walking along roadway charges and 94% of failure to comply charges were followed against African Americans. This points to racist practices by the police and a blind eye being turned to those by city officials. However, they are not unique to Ferguson. There are hundreds of Fergusons across the country. In the seven years up to 2012, an African American has been killed by a white police officer approximately twice per week. Black people are three times more likely than white people to be killed when they encounter police.

I commend to the Deputy and the House President Obama's inspiring speech on the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery. It is a comprehensive statement on race relations in the US in terms of progress made there during the past 50 years and an honest and frank assessment of the journey still to be completed, including reform of the US criminal justice system regarding its treatment of African Americans.

Indeed, as a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ICESCR, Ireland supports the right of all people to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as enshrined in Article 12 of the covenant. I note that the United States has signed but not ratified the ICESCR and therefore is not a party to it.

He also highlighted that he has no intention of ensuring that a democratic two-state solution is ever established. In the face of this, I once again call on the Minister to respect the wishes of the vast majority of Irish people and of both Houses of the Oireachtas and to recognise officially the Palestinian state without delay.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	34	The comments by the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, before the recent election regarding both the two-state solution and the turnout of Arab voters in that election were disappointing and unwelcome. Such statements are particularly regrettable in the tense and inflammatory situation in the Middle East. We know from our own peace process how words of supposed comfort to one side can have a disproportionately negative impact on the other side. Regarding the two-state solution, I note that Mr. Netanyahu subsequently stated that his remarks meant only that conditions at present are not conducive to such an outcome. Following the election, Mr. Netanyahu also apologised publicly for his comments about Arab voters. The international community has quickly reaffirmed its conviction that the two-state solution remains the only viable basis for a resolution of the conflict. The High Representative, Federica Mogherini, on behalf of the EU, President Obama and others have made that point directly to Mr. Netanyahu in the course of conversations following the election. What is most important is how the new government in Israel, which we expect Mr. Netanyahu to form, acts and what is set out in its programme for government.  The Irish Government remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. All of our actions and policies at EU and international level are designed to advance the goal of peace and to secure a comprehensive peace agreement at the earliest opportunity.

However, I welcome the fact that the Minister signed a letter with other Foreign Ministers calling for the labelling of Israeli settlement goods. It is a welcome first step, but it does not go nearly far enough. Just last week the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that an Israeli Government can legally seize Palestinian lands in occupied east Jerusalem. This has become a tool for many right wing groups to increase the Jewish presence in east Jerusalem, which is against international law and an attempt to stop Jerusalem becoming the capital of a future Palestinian state. This will not be on any labels. Human Rights Watch released a 74 page report last week which states that Israeli settlement farms in the West Bank are using Palestinian child labour to grow, harvest and pack agricultural products, many of them for export. Again, that will not be on the labels. We need further action. I ask the Minister to push for a ban on settlement goods entering the EU market.

The High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has made it quite clear that she wants the Foreign Affairs Council to review the approach of the European Union to the Middle East peace process. I have strongly supported this view and I have raised the matter at Council level. I am pleased that, in response, the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has indicated that this issue will form part of the agenda for the next Foreign Affairs Council in May.I would like to acknowledge Deputy Crowe's comments regarding a recent letter, to which my name and the names of other EU Foreign Ministers were appended. The aim of the letter was to ensure a certain level of influence will be brought to bear regarding the settlements in the region. I had an opportunity to visit the area of the settlements which is under some legal dispute. I acknowledge the recent decision of the High Court in that regard. I assure Deputy Crowe that Ireland will continue to keep a close eye on the situation in the region.

According to a recent report from the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 2014 was the highest since 1967. The death toll in the occupied territories - some 2,314 Palestinians were killed in 2014, compared to 39 in 2013 - has been described by the UN co-ordinator as "devastating". Conditions are getting worse. We need action to ensure a Palestinian state is created. This should involve a democratic two-state peace process. The Minister needs to ensure the Government urgently recognises a Palestinian state. My biggest fear, and the fear of those who are concerned about what is happening in this region, is that conditions are getting worse and the proposed democratic two-state solution is getting further away.

I believe that as an important first step, Mr. Netanyahu should now proceed to form his Government. I expect that this will be finalised in the next few weeks. I have had an opportunity to visit the region and see at first hand the difficulties and challenges involved. I assure the Deputy that the Government's approach to the recognition of Palestine, as set out in detail during a debate in this Chamber before Christmas, involves achieving and recognising a Palestinian state. That has always been the objective of the Government and our policies are directed towards that aim. I would like to repeat what I have made clear on numerous occasions, which is that I have absolutely no difficulty in principle with the idea of recognition if I believe that can contribute to achieving a lasting settlement of the conflict. Indeed, I continue to reflect on what early recognition could mean for Palestine and for Ireland's influence in this critical and important issue.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	40	Sharing the experience of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland is identified as a priority in our foreign policy document, The Global Island, which was published earlier this year. Since its establishment in 2008, the conflict resolution unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has engaged in such work on an ongoing basis. Each conflict and each peace process is unique. There is no one model for reconciliation that will be successful in every context. Many parts of the world that have been affected by conflict look to Ireland for ideas, inspiration and advice. Experience has shown that Ireland can offer a useful lesson-sharing engagement. This practical sharing of good practice and experience needs to be tailored to the specifics of the particular conflict situation. At the same time, general insights and principles that may be applied in various contexts with the aim of building a sustainable peace need to be communicated. The Department's lesson-sharing work has been largely undertaken in response to demand from international organisations working in a number of conflict situations in countries throughout the world. Since 2008, the conflict resolution unit has hosted delegations from Afghanistan, Moldova, Nepal, South Korea and the Middle East.Already since the start of 2015, relevant lessons from Ireland’s experience of promoting peace support and post-conflict reconciliation have been shared in the contexts of conflicts and peace processes in Colombia, Ukraine, Turkey and the Middle East. Lesson-sharing has addressed a wide range of conflict resolution issues such as security sector support, human rights, the role of international third parties in peace processes, the participation of women and communities and the importance of confidence building and popular endorsement of agreements reached. We will continue to undertake this valuable work in the context of the ongoing process of reconciliation and co-operation on this island. Two-way lesson-sharing allows the Government to nurture peace and reconciliation on this island while at the same time providing a positive model for other countries seeking to resolve conflict and build peace and harmony in communities.

Would the Minister say his Department is being progressive in this matter? Are we taking a much more active role rather than waiting for people to come to us? Are we using Irish Aid, which has a budget of €660 million and which increased this year for the first time in seven years? Do we use Irish Aid to break down barriers, particularly in areas such as Mozambique where there is an ongoing conflict? Are we using the skills of Irish Aid and the Department to help in that area? Do we use religious or civic agencies, particularly in conflict areas in Africa? Many religious organisations, particularly in Africa, have done tremendous work in highlighting the progressive nature of the Irish contribution.

Coming from a man who wears the white jersey most Sundays, I suppose a white coat is entirely appropriate for a Kildare man. I thank Deputy Lawlor for his question. I acknowledge the work of the many NGOs in this area and people from the religious sector, many of whom have enhanced the reputation of Ireland overseas, particularly in Africa, over a long number of years. I also acknowledge the work of the overseas aid unit. The Department obtains a measure of feedback from the many lesson-learning meetings and that feedback is almost uniformly positive. We look directly to the relevance of our experience in Northern Ireland and our own conflict situation and peace process.

It was unplanned by the sound of it. I do not know how the Government can believe they were not carrying weapons or munitions. The idea that they were not engaged in military operations or exercises, which are in breach of Irish neutrality, is beyond belief. How in God's name can the Minister still hold that we have a policy of neutrality when we allow such things to happen?

These include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question must not form part of military exercises or operations. In seeking requests to my Department in respect of these aircraft, the United States Embassy indicated that the purpose of the landings was for crew rest. My Department has not received any information from An Garda Síochána in relation to these aircraft. Any questions relating to Garda matters should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	49	The two airplanes in question were Hercules planes. One was numbered BD 5379 and is a US Navy Lockheed C-130T warplane operated by a VR-64 Condors' Fleet logistics support squadron from McGuire AFB. They are part of a team that is entrusted to safely execute effective, responsive C-130 Hercules air logistics missions in direct support of fleet and combatant commanders worldwide. These planes are engaged in military activity. Only this week, Dr. Edward Horgan, who was trying to get a flight from Shannon to London, saw four military planes parked on the runway at Shannon. There were as many military planes in the airport as there were civilian. This is a civilian airport. When is the Government going to stop deceiving the public that we are not facilitating US military ambitions by allowing our airport to be used for military purposes? It was bad enough that the previous Government did it but this Government is supposed to be the party of law and order. Why can it not call the truth and admit that it has a supportive role in the US military position?

Could I make it clear to him that there is no question of deceiving the public? Deputy Wallace will be completely familiar with the arrangements for authorising the landing of US military aircraft at Irish airports, namely, the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order of 1952 and related arrangements. These arrangements apply to all foreign military aircraft, including US aircraft landing at Shannon. Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality involves non-participation in any military alliance. Ireland has not entered into any military alliance with the US or any other country or organisation. The use of Shannon Airport by the US military is a long-standing practice and has been in place for over 50 years. Permitting the use of Shannon by the US military does not challenge or undermine Ireland's policy of military neutrality nor does it deceive anybody. The regulations are quite clear.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	51	I beg to differ. In reply to Question No. 657 tabled recently by Deputy Clare Daly, the Minister said:The US is granted blanket permission for overflights by unarmed military aircraft. The US Embassy provides my Department with post hoc monthly statistical returns on the total number of overflights by such aircraft. Its return for February 2015 states that there were 48 such overflights by transport, passenger and refuelling aircraft.How in God's name can the Minister say that there are no arms or munitions on these planes going through our airspace? What are US assurances worth given the terrorist activities of that country and the torture programme it ran, which we facilitated by allowing rendition flights through Shannon?  Deputy Clare Daly and I are due back in court in Ennis tomorrow because we tried to inspect planes, something the Government refuses to allow the Defence Forces or gardaí to do. We are trying to keep the peace, not break it. We oppose war. The Government is supporting war and the arms industry. A total of 33.5 million people have been displaced because of conflict. This is why we have the trouble in the Mediterranean.

The principal of sovereign immunity applies automatically to foreign state or military aircraft, in the same way that it applies to Irish State or military aircraft abroad. Details supplied to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by diplomatic missions abroad are accepted in good faith as being accurate. Information provided to other states by Irish diplomatic missions seeking diplomatic clearance for flights undertaken by the Air Corps are similarly accepted by those countries to be accurate. As I have already made clear, my Department has not received any information from An Garda Síochána in relation to the two aircraft which are the subject of the Deputy's question. Questions relating to Garda matters can, of course, be directed to my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.

My Department’s statement of strategy 2015-17, laid before this House on 14 April, outlines how we intend to achieve our high level goals in the coming years. These goals are rooted in the priority areas set out in the Government’s recent policy review, The Global Island: Ireland’s Foreign Policy for a Changing World. Our five goals are: to serve our people at home and abroad and to promote reconciliation and co-operation; to work for a fairer, more just, secure and sustainable world; to advance Ireland’s prosperity by promoting our economic interests internationally; to protect and advance Ireland’s values and interests in Europe; and to strengthen our influence and capacity to deliver our goals.  I know that the Deputy has a particular interest in the prosperity goal. I am sure he will agree that the vital work of restoring our international reputation, promoting our economic recovery and the creation of jobs must be at the heart of the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with our embassy network playing a particularly crucial role. These goals are intertwined and support one another. I look forward to leading my Department in continuing to deliver on them for the Irish people.

On the overseas aid budget of 0.7% of GDP, as committed to by Government in the programme for Government, when is that target expected to be achieved and what strategy has been put in place by Government to ensure it is achieved? In regard to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's One-China policy, is it proposed to review that policy in regard to Taiwan, considering it is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and on the basis that Ireland already has a great relationship with Taiwan via an Oireachtas friendship group? Also, in regard to the Syrian civil war, how many refugees arising out of that crisis will be taken into Ireland?

I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work closely with my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the State agencies to lead the Export Trade Council to maximise the economic benefits of our relationship with China and other states in the region. On the matter of overseas aid, in the context of a most challenging and difficult economic time, with the country on the verge of bankruptcy in 2010-2011, over the past three years we have continued to maintain the overseas aid budget in such a way as to ensure maximum influence abroad, with particular reference to the developing world. As the Deputy will be aware, we are a neutral country. We are not involved in any military alliance or military organisation. With that in mind, we place particular emphasis on the need to provide humanitarian aid. Overseas development aid is top of our priorities. Indeed, our international reputation demonstrates the level of influence that we have in that area.

In working towards achieving that goal of 0.7% of GDP, in light of the upswing in the economy, will the Minister make it his business to ensure that more funding is allocated to the overseas budget? In addition, is he happy and satisfied that every red cent of taxpayers' money is being spent in the most appropriate manner and that there are full checks and balances in place to ensure that the funding is being received by those on the ground who need humanitarian help? Regarding Syria, has the Minister any comment to make on whether Ireland could take more refugees into the country to help them get on with their lives? There has been considerable persecution out there of Palestinian refugees. The Christian community has been terrorised as well.

With regard to whether I am happy or satisfied, I am neither. However, I am anxious to ensure that all our goals are realised at the earliest opportunity. We are heading towards the fifth budget of this Government and I am anxious that in the course of that budget we have an opportunity to increase our commitment in the form of overseas aid in order to help those who are unable to help themselves in the developing regions of the world, with particular reference to Africa, where our reputation is particularly strong. It would be my wish, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, that we continue to increase the budget until such time as we reach an acceptable international target.

There are a couple of matters. There was a UN conference on 31 March on the issue. Can the Minister detail whether his Department has pledged money to this appeal and what provisions are in place to ensure that countries that pledge money pay up?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	74	My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, represented Ireland at the international pledging conference for Syria which was held in Kuwait on 31 March. He announced that in 2015 Ireland would provide a further €12 million in humanitarian assistance for those suffering as a result of the conflict. In total, the international community pledged some €3.5 billion in humanitarian assistance at the conference. The crisis in Syria and the region has now entered its fifth year. The human impact of the violence and displacement of communities has been devastating. Some 220,000 Syrians have been killed, and almost 4 million have fled as refugees to neighbouring countries. Ireland has been one of the most generous international contributors to the Syrian humanitarian response on a per capita basis. Our pledge for 2015 will bring the Government's overall response to €41 million. I recognise that this can only address the humanitarian crisis and that international efforts must be strengthened towards a long-term political solution in Syria and the region. I remain extremely concerned about the appalling suffering visited upon the Syrian people, and especially by recent reports about the situation of the remaining population of the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of Damascus.There are now 18,000 civilians remaining in that camp, including 3,500 children. The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, specifically raised Ireland's concerns about the camp with the Commissioner General of the UN Relief and Works Agency when they met at the Syria pledging conference. I call on all parties to cease armed activity in the camp and to provide unhindered humanitarian access to those in need. Deputy Crowe raised the point about how to ensure the various pledges are honoured. Recently, I attended a Gaza reconstruction conference in Cairo and I had the opportunity of pledging funds for the reconstruction of Gaza again. Regrettably, the reconstruction work in Gaza did not take place in the manner hoped for at the conference and thereafter. I am calling on our international colleagues to ensure the pledges are complied with. However, this is contingent upon works taking place in the region in the form of house construction and infrastructural developments on an ongoing basis.

The Yarmouk camp has been described as hell on earth. Has there been additional funding from the Government for this particular situation? One of the difficulties in the Syrian war relates to people trying to flee Syria. We have seen several occurrences recently of boats sinking in the Mediterranean and so on. The number of drownings is 50 times greater than last year. Does the Minister believe there should be an EU response on the matter? What is the Government's view on the strengthening search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean?

Vulnerable groups, such as women and children and the elderly, are particularly affected. Ireland continues to advocate for the full implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions on humanitarian access in Syria. Opposition-controlled areas are particularly insecure and volatile and access has continued to decline in Syrian Government-controlled areas. While challenges of an immense nature remain there has been some provision of cross-border relief from Jordan and Turkey. As of the end of March, a total of 91 consignments from Turkey and Jordan were delivered to Syria under UN Security Council resolutions 2165 and 2191. This has had the effect of ensuring 1.5 million people have received food assistance, over 700,000 have received medical or health supplies, over 400,000 were helped with water, sanitation and hygiene support and over 1 million were assisted with essential humanitarian supplies.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	78	The Government launched the Ireland 2016 commemorative programme on 31 March. The programme features seven strands, including a global and diaspora programme. Through its embassy and consulate network, my Department has been engaging, and will continue to engage, with the Irish diaspora, community groups and our international partners throughout the world to plan and support events commemorating the centenary of the Rising. The programme provides an opportunity to reflect on the national and international dimensions of the Rising, explore the influence of the diaspora on the Rising and celebrate our continued close ties with Irish communities abroad and with our international friends and partners. The global programme fund will be available to ensure a series of events in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and further afield. The fund is of the order of €500,000. A wide range of events, including film screenings, artistic and cultural programmes, seminars and community events are already included in the Ireland 2016 global programme and many more are planned. Ireland 2016 is an opportunity to present Ireland to the world and celebrate our achievements over the past century, including our people, our long-standing programme of humanitarian assistance, our peacekeeping record, ongoing efforts to support peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland as well as the progress that has been made on Ireland's economic recovery. Together with Culture Ireland, my Department and its missions overseas will work to highlight the best of Irish arts worldwide throughout 2016 in a programme that focuses on contemporary artists and influences while reflecting on Ireland's cultural journey over the past 100 years.

A wide range of international events from Paris to Brasilia and from Boston to Buenos Aires are being planned. Deputy Smith spoke of the regions. In the United States, where five of the seven signatories of the Proclamation spent periods of time, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, in partnership with the Irish Embassy, will host a flagship three week festival of Irish arts and culture. In France the first International Beckett Paris Festival will take place in 2016. A number of academic events are taking place next year in South America, including an exhibition on Roger Casement in Brasilia and an international conference on 1916 in Argentina in association with the University of El Salvador and the Irish Argentine community. The Irish language also features in the global programme. Glór na nGael and the Consulate General of Ireland in Boston will hold a conference in 2016 bringing together Irish language groups from throughout the United States. Many of these events have been agreed upon while others are in the course of preparation. They will ensure that the events of 1916 and the centenary will be commemorated worldwide.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	82	In The Sunday Times last Sunday there was an article concerning the sale of Siteserv to Millington under the ageis of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. The article was based on freedom of information documents the newspaper had secured from the Department of Finance in the form of memoranda. Any reader of the article would have to come to the conclusion that there are grave concerns about how that company was sold.There were a number of such concerns. I pay tribute to the Independent Deputy Catherine Murphy, who has doggedly pursued this issue for well over 12 months, if not longer, through parliamentary questions and so on. In the beginning she was told by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that he was satisfied that the best interests of the taxpayer were met in the sale of this company. We know that IBRC sold Siteserv at a loss of €105 million. We know that the legal advisers acted for both the purchaser and the seller. We now know that the financial adviser Davy, which was advising the company but whose fundamental obligation was to its own shareholders and not the taxpayer, recommended a payout of €5 million to the shareholders to induce them to sell. Therefore, in a company that owed the State €150 million, the shareholders and directors, five of whom were, I think, clients of Davy, got €5 million. Trade buyers were excluded on what I would consider to be relatively spurious grounds and there were reports of other companies that wanted to bid higher but were spurned. Latterly, as Independent Deputy Catherine Murphy was putting her questions, the Minister revealed somewhat more in answers to parliamentary questions, and outlined all of the concerns I have outlined as being concerns of his officials. We have now learned that there were two separate reviews of the deal, one by Department of Finance officials and another by Central Bank officials. There are huge potential conflicts of interest all over this deal. Let us remember that we are talking about a company whose subsidiary, Sierra, went on to win the largest contract to install water meters and has now become a very profitable company in itself.

Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Government, and particularly the Minister for Finance, did everything it could to protect the taxpayer, given all of these questions? A separate memo also states, rather alarmingly, that officials had concerns about other large transactions under the aegis of IBRC. These were taxpayers' assets that were being disposed of. Will the Taoiseach initiate an inquiry into this - a proper inquiry to get to the bottom of it? It is important because it goes to the very heart of how the taxpayer was or is protected, or not protected, in terms of the sale of State assets and also in terms of the specific deal in question.

I did not see the article to which he referred, although I take his point that this is based upon articles or documentation received from the Department. While the Deputy has asked a number of questions, I do not have the information to reply in detail to him. Perhaps it might be better if this were responded to in some detail by the Minister for Finance, either by Priority Question or by Topical Issue, or, indeed, by discussion at the Oireachtas committee. I do not want to say something that I cannot stand over here. The Deputy has raised a number of issues. He has previously questioned the sale of Siteserv in March 2012, which was approved by the board of IBRC. I do not have the detail of what the Deputy is talking about in that regard. I will find answers to the questions the Deputy raises, but I do not want to commit to an official investigation until I am satisfied that answers can be had to the questions that Deputy Martin and Deputy Catherine Murphy raise in regard to IBRC.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	86	Frankly, I find it incredible that the Taoiseach could come in here on a Tuesday and say to me that he has not read the article in question. I find that very difficult to comprehend. Did anybody bring it to the Taoiseach's attention in his Department? Did the Minister, Deputy Noonan, ring him about it? Did anybody alert him to the fact that Government memos were going to be released under freedom of information and that the article in The Sunday Times contained such very serious assertions? It was stated:Arguably, no payment should have been made to shareholders given the precarious position the company was in. Examinership would appear to have been a reasonable option.In addition, trade buyers were excluded and there was the question of "whether [having] the company running the process was the correct decision", and so on. The Taoiseach is leader of the country and is in charge of Government. There are people out there in mortgage arrears whose cases I have been raising with the Taoiseach for the last month. They do not get paid off when they owe a bank a lot of money. We are talking about a company that owed €150 million. The advisers on the sale of the company recommended that they got the top end - €5 million. Five of the shareholders were clients of this company. This was all going on under the Taoiseach's nose and he was just oblivious to the whole thing, if we are to believe him today.

Did anybody at all alert the Taoiseach to this over the last number of days? Did any of his officials contact him to say there was a very serious article on the front page of The Sunday Times? I know Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about this on Leaders' Questions, so the Taoiseach would have been aware of the issue. It is not as if it is completely new issue to him, as it was raised before on a number of occasions.

With regard to what happened in March 2012, the board of IBRC met and approved the sale of Siteserv - Deputy Martin did not mention it by name, but that is probably one of the cases he was talking about. Under the relationship framework at the time between the Minister for Finance and the bank, which had been in place since July 2009, the board of IBRC was required to engage with the Minister for Finance on certain key issues, which included any material acquisitions, disposals, investments, realisations or other transactions, other than in the ordinary course of Anglo Irish Bank's banking business.It should be noted, however, that that framework did not include any specific monetary thresholds which would trigger a compulsory or mandatory consultation with the Minister for Finance.

As such, IBRC's efforts as a secure lender to maximise the recovery of its loans to Siteserv was considered in the ordinary course of business. For that reason, and because of the framework relationship, IBRC was not required to consult with the Minister for Finance on this matter in advance of making the decision to approve the sale of the company referred to in the question.

It is a very important point. The officials from the Department of Finance told the management of IBRC that it was to act as if the framework relationship that came into place two weeks later was already in place, which meant that it should have been notified because it considered a loss of over €100 million. The Taoiseach should put that on the record.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	123	People have been horrified at weekend news reports of the deaths of an estimated 900 people in the Mediterranean. Many of those people died because unscrupulous traffickers locked refugees, including women and children, in the hold of the ship that sank. Some 1,500 citizens have drowned on their way to Europe in 2015, which is 50 times more than at this point in 2014. There are reports of other ships having sunk in the past 24 hours.  The images of refugees being rescued are now a nightly sight on our television screens. These people are fleeing conflicts in Syria, Libya, Somalia, Nigeria and other places. They are also fleeing famine and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Like the Irish through the centuries, they are prosecuted, persecuted, injured, hungry and looking for a better life. We should not lose sight of the fact that their horrors are a direct result of Europe's colonial record over the years and the much more recent policies of the West towards north Africa and the Middle East. Italy has urged the EU to act to prevent further loss of life. EU foreign Ministers met and produced a ten-point plan which, in my humble opinion, is inadequate for dealing with this humanitarian disaster. For example, doubling funds to the EU border patrol mission will not provide the search and rescue operations needed in the face of this crisis. I ask the Taoiseach to outline to the Dáil the message he will bring to our EU partners and the proposals he will argue for at Thursday's meeting of the European Council.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	124	As we speak, a commemoration march from Strokestown to the east coast is taking place. It commemorates the 1,490 people who walked the route during the Famine and boarded coffin ships for Canada, upon which more than 700 of them died. A point made yesterday was that this replicates what is happening in the Middle East. This is simply appalling in the sense of humanity. The fact that it is on the Mediterranean exacerbates the situation, because people's lives are lost through drowning. Some 1 million people have left Syria and moved to south Lebanon or Jordan, but there is no humanitarian plan to deal with that scale of migration. There are countries without boundaries in Africa, where people move from Somalia through Libya to the coast to get to Europe. The scale of this is unprecedented in terms of numbers. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Flanagan, representing the Government, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, attended the meeting in Luxembourg yesterday. There was agreement from the European Ministers for foreign affairs and security and justice on the ten-point plan. President Tusk has called a meeting of the European Council on Thursday to deal with this.  Deputy Adams's question is perfectly valid. It depends upon the scale of investment in search and rescue operations and humanitarian relief. The second part of that concerns what it is possible to do in vast areas that are on a knife edge and where all kinds of cruelty against humanity are practised. These people, desperate in their destitution, are arriving at the shores of the Mediterranean, are put, in some cases, on ships without captain, steward or compass, and are doomed before they ever sail. This is an appalling disgrace. It will not be sorted out at the European Council meeting on Thursday, but Italy and Malta are to be commended for what they did. Italy had the Mare Nostrum project in place and now needs assistance in terms of surveillance, interception, rescue and humanitarian relief. There is a deeper and much more challenging problem in the vast countries where large numbers of people are being treated savagely by warring factions, a problem that is not confined to Libya alone. Ireland will make its case on Thursday and will continue to offer humanitarian assistance. A figure of 5,000 refugees has been mentioned, and Ireland will play its part as it has always done. In many years gone by, people from this country went wherever they might be welcome, which is one of the reasons we have such an extensive diaspora of descendants. This is an immediate problem. Children, babies and helpless people are being loaded onto boats at this moment in time by unscrupulous racketeers who know that the complete inadequacy of the vessels they are putting them on dooms them to the probability of drowning in the Mediterranean when all they want is to flee from persecution, savagery and death and look beyond the immediate shores to a place where they might have hope and a new life. The challenge is of an unprecedented scale for all countries in Europe. For our part, in terms of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and Equality and Defence, we will contribute in whatever way we can to dealing with this issue.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	125	I tried to moderate my question because I do not want to make any political points out of such a serious issue, but I asked the Taoiseach to outline for us the message he will bring to our European partners and the proposals for which he will argue. He did not do that. He told me about a commemorative march from Strokestown. I commend those on that march. The Taoiseach is very familiar with the walk from Louisburgh known as the Trail of Tears, a road I have walked. Famously, Native Americans assisted Irish people from the Taoiseach's county. If I recall correctly, it was the Choctaw tribe, who did more in their day for the Irish people than we are doing now for others. The problem is a result of direct interference by Western powers in the affairs of the countries involved. People are being persecuted and are fleeing for a better life. They are trying to reach a better place to live. It has been reported that the EU will seek to stop them at sea. Is that true? What is the view of the Government on that? Will people be detained in camps in Libya? The Taoiseach mentioned the fever camps. I visited those in Grosse Île on the eastern coast of Canada and North America, where our people died. What happened in the era of the coffin ships is happening now.The proposal to resettle 5,000 immigrants in EU states is a drop in the ocean considering that hundreds of thousands are desperate to travel. Reference is made to a package of return travel to where the individuals are trying to flee from. What is this? Ryanair? The resettlement of 1,200 people in 14 years is what we have achieved. The treatment of people in direct provision centres is not a matter of which the Government or its predecessors can be proud. Will the Taoiseach accept that as a nation that has experienced conflict, famine, forced emigration, fever camps, death and the spectre of coffin ships, Ireland needs to strengthen search and rescue operations through a joint effort involving EU member states? Does he accept that the European Union as a whole must provide more safe and legal routes to Europe for those who are now being forced to take dangerous journeys in the first place and ensure they have access to international protection? The very least the Taoiseach could do is inform the Dáil of the proposals he will put at the meeting to help alleviate the plight of these people.

The purpose of the meeting of the European Council on Thursday is to endorse the ten-point plan put together yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministers for security and home affairs in Luxembourg. Clearly, there is an immediate catastrophe facing us. People are being loaded onto unseaworthy craft now on the shores of Libya. Many of them have travelled from Somalia, Mali and other locations, and others are fleeing the conflicts in both Syria and Libya. They all want to cross the Mediterranean, and Malta, Lampedusa and Italy are the first ports of call. Clearly, this is a matter of the utmost seriousness. What can Ireland do about this? It can contribute with other bigger nations with greater resources. The Deputy is well aware that what is in our own DNA, given our history, leads us to be one of the most humanitarian countries around, proportionately speaking. We will continue to be that. As I stated, between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Defence, we will contribute to this debate on Thursday in the hope of saving the lives of those who have just left the shores of Libya in craft that will never reach the far side of the Mediterranean. The ten-point plan exists for everybody. The pirates, smugglers and unscrupulous people are using their deadly opportunity to make money by putting innocent people, who are fleeing war, rape, pillage and all kinds of inhumanity, on boats to cross the Mediterranean from the Libyan shore in the knowledge that there is sometimes neither skipper, captain, steward nor compass to get them to the far side. Mare Nostrum did save many lives. I expect that the meeting on Thursday will result in a much more focused and immediate response in terms of greater surveillance, activity and humanitarian relief and a greater opportunity to search for and rescue these innocent people. From a political point of view, addressing the causes of the desperation of so many people, requiring them to leave for Europe, must be dealt with in the bigger political field. As the Deputy is well aware, that is an enormous challenge.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	127	Regarding the provision of an adequate home help service by the HSE, there have been alarming circumstances in County Kerry, particularly in the past two weeks. Hundreds of vulnerable recipients have been informed by letter that the HSE is making some drastic cuts to its already-diminished service. which has been diminishing over the past two years. The unfortunate notice is being sent to a very worried and stressed group of citizens. This action is replicated in other counties. The Taoiseach will have to intervene very strongly with the Minister for Health as this cannot be allowed to continue. The home help service for our elderly and vulnerable population is probably the best and most effective means of delivery of home care services to ensure people can live in their own communities, at a very low cost. This is the environment in which people are happiest. There is a policy of upgrading and developing the delivery of community care in general, but what is happening on the ground is contrary to all this. There is certainly a deficiency and we need to rectify it as a matter of urgency. These regressive measures are further compounding an already-diminishing service. The service for many deserving elderly and infirm people is being very much cut down to the very minimum. The cost of home care provision is significantly lower than the cost of nursing home provision but there is currently an emphasis on forcing those in receipt of home care into private nursing homes as an alternative means of care. In many cases, an adequate home help service, in addition to the respite care provided in the district and community hospitals, would be the solution. The trend has been evident over the past two years, in particular. The minimum number of home help hours has been provided. In many cases, perhaps only a half an hour is allowed at a certain time in the morning or afternoon. Consequently, the home help provider may not be in inside the door of the house and may be trying to get her or his chores done as fast as possible before leaving. What is happening is counter-productive. The best value for money is not being realised as the service is currently run. Over €70 million has been provided for the care of the elderly under the fair deal system and community care in general. I ask that sufficient moneys be invested immediately to address the issue I am raising. I ask the Taoiseach to speak to the Minister for Health this evening to stop this unfortunate action, which is causing undue fear, stress and strain among those concerned and their families.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	128	The home help scheme has been of extraordinary benefit to thousands of people over the years, given the hours of care and attention given by the home help staff throughout the country. I agree with Deputy Fleming that elderly people, either living alone or in numbers in houses, prefer to be in their own place. Many can manage this with a little opportunity to have home help provided to them. In its decision before Christmas, the Government provided an extra €25 million for the fair deal scheme so people who have to go to nursing homes can do so without having to wait for a very long period. A further €75 million was allocated in recent weeks. A portion of that was for better home care packages, which would include home help service and care, depending on the complications or challenges people face. The home help scheme is monitored and managed by individuals within each district. Many home help personnel, whom I meet regularly, will say they can adjust the hours for person X to suit him or her better.As the Deputy pointed out, some people might require half an hour in the morning and others might require much longer. There is always a challenge with a population which is ageing to have adequate numbers of home help carers. This is part of the process of trying to normalise the health system so people can stay at home for as long as is possible before they may have to go to a nursing home for more full-time care and attention. I expect the home help managers in each district will look at the budget they have and the extent of personnel and how best to manage it in the interests of the patients. I am quite sure the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, will give the Deputy a more detailed response about any particular area, including his own.

Will the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, contact HSE South immediately to address urgently this matter in County Kerry and in other counties where it may be happening? It should be resolved this week rather than having these vulnerable and elderly people experience undue fears and stressful conditions. Rather than the negativity and cost-cutting, we need to counteract this with positive measures for the good of all and have an enhanced service at minimum cost. It can be done and I ask the Taoiseach to stop what is happening. He should direct the HSE to immediately withdraw the letters and provide adequate convalescence in the district hospitals and respite care to give occasional breaks to families and put in place procedures to resolve this to the satisfaction of everybody. It would be a good day's work if the Taoiseach acted with haste on this matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	130	I thank Deputy Fleming for his contribution. He will agree the home help scheme has, by and large, given great comfort and has been a great response to so many people for a relatively low cost. A total of €320 million has been allocated for home care packages and home help allowances and 100,000 people receive benefit from it. I am sure this is not what the Deputy suggests should be stopped because of the great benefits people receive. It is only right and very normal that elderly people in receipt of home help assistance want to stay in their own homes and there are a variety of schemes around that to assist them. I have seen them in the Deputy's county where elements of the Tús scheme, together with the local authorities, have helped improve conditions in some of the houses where people receive home help and in the day care centres they visit to improve the quality and comfort of their lives. This issue is monitored all of the time. As I stated, €320 million has been allocated this year and 100,000 people receive support from it. I will have the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, reply to Deputy Fleming in respect of the letters which have been issued in his county.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	131	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together. The establishment of the Fennelly commission was one of a wide range of decisions taken by the Government to help restore trust in the justice system following a series of events and allegations which caused very significant public concern. These include the most wide-ranging reforms of the policing and justice system since the foundation of the State, as well as robust actions taken to investigate certain allegations. The policing reforms include the establishment of a new independent policing authority; the appointment of a chair-designate for the new authority; the first-ever international open competition for the position of Garda Commissioner, which was run by the Public Appointments Service and involved the chair-designate of the new authority; a similar open competition, which is currently under way, for the positions of Deputy Commissioner in the Garda Síochána; the provision of enhanced powers to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission; the passing of new legislation to protect whistleblowers; and the reform and extension of freedom of information legislation. The drafting of the legislation to establish the independent policing authority is nearing completion and it is intended that it will be published in early May. I hope it can be enacted by the summer recess. When the Bill is published, the Public Appointments Service will be requested to conduct an open process for the selection of the remaining members of the police authority and a new chief executive and support staff. The authority will then be established in shadow form so that it can commence preparations for its formal establishment and get down to work quickly. In addition to this series of reforms, the Minister for Justice and Equality commissioned a report from an expert independent review group, chaired by Mr. Kevin Toland, into the Department of Justice and Equality. That report was published in July 2014 and the Department is now implementing its recommendations. As well as implementing wide-ranging reforms, a number of independent inquiries were established by the Government to investigate serious matters of public concern. Mr. Justice Cooke was appointed to investigate allegations that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission was the subject of unlawful surveillance. His report was published in June 2014.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	135	Yes. Mr. Sean Guerin SC was appointed to investigate allegations made by Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe about crime investigations in the Cavan and Monaghan district. His report was published in May 2014. He recommended that a commission of investigation be established to further investigate certain matters. That commission, whose sole member is Judge O'Higgins, has now been established and has commenced its work. Potentially the most serious allegations related to taping of telephone calls in Garda stations over a period of 30 years or more, including their possible implications for a case that was then before the courts. This is the case taken by Mr. Ian Bailey, which concluded recently. Those allegations are now being investigated by a commission of investigation, whose sole member is Mr. Justice Fennelly. Following the initial proposal to investigate the taping allegations, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality wrote to me recommending that the Fennelly commission should also address issues related to the retirement of the Garda Commissioner. I agreed to that proposal. The terms of reference of the commission were therefore amended to include issues relating to the furnishing of a letter dated 10 March 2014 sent by the then Garda Commissioner to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality and the sequence of events leading up to the retirement of the Garda Commissioner. In July 2014, Mr. Justice Fennelly advised me that it would not be possible to complete the full investigation by the end of last year but that it may be possible for him to submit an earlier interim report on the issues of the Commissioner's letter and his retirement, if so requested by me.In response, I formally requested that Mr. Justice Fennelly submit that interim report if he believed it to be feasible and appropriate, and I informed the Dáil of that request. In November 2014, the commission submitted a detailed progress report to me and formally requested an extension of the timeframe for his full investigation. He also indicated that he expected that his interim report on the issues of the letter and retirement would be submitted by the end of March 2015. I agreed to the extension of the overall timeframe. I also published the detailed progress report. In February 2015, Mr. Justice Fennelly wrote to me again stating that the commission was at an advanced stage in its preparation of a draft interim report. He also indicated that the draft interim report would not be disseminated to affected parties, which is required under the relevant legislation, until after the proceedings in the Bailey case had been disposed of by the High Court. That letter was also published by me. The proceedings in the Bailey case have now been disposed of. It continues to be entirely a matter for Mr. Justice Fennelly how he conducts his investigation and when he submits his reports. It would be totally inappropriate for the Government to seek to direct the independent chair of the commission of investigation as to how he should prioritise or otherwise conduct his work. I am aware of speculation about the evidence given to Mr. Justice Fennelly by me and by others. Mr. Justice Fennelly's progress report of November 2014, which has been published, outlines the procedures followed by the commission. It states that he wrote to 20 witnesses and heard oral evidence from 15 witnesses. He also stated in his November report that some witnesses were recalled in September, that the process was not yet complete and that he anticipated further hearings. I have provided written and oral evidence to the commission, at its request, in respect of those matters of which I have personal knowledge. That evidence was given in private, in accordance with the Commission of Investigation Act. The rules and procedures of the commission state that the disclosure of evidence heard or documentation produced to the commission in private is not permitted save in certain limited circumstances set out in the Act, and may constitute a criminal offence. I understand that those rules and procedures were provided to all witnesses. I therefore cannot comment on my own evidence or that of any other witness. It is a matter for Mr. Justice Fennelly to finalise his report in accordance with the procedures set out in the relevant legislation. When his completed report is received by me, I will publish it in accordance with the law.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	136	It is ironic that we are discussing this while the former Minister is in court answering questions on similar topics. I gather the Taoiseach is saying that although he promised the Fennelly report would be published before the end of 2014, he is now saying it will be by the end of 2015 and that it is out of his hands. The progress of the promised reform is frustrating. It is all linked. There is a perception that the Taoiseach is not very keen on getting to the truth. I fear there are many things we will not discover before the next election. The Guerin report was set up nine months after it was initially planned. Perhaps the Taoiseach can enlighten us on why it took so long. The excuse used for the independent review mechanism, which was to be delivered in September and which we have still not seen after Easter - eight months later - is that there are a lot of cases. There are always a lot of cases. I wonder why the Taoiseach thought it could be delivered in September. I wonder why the GSOC changes that the Taoiseach was extolling some moments ago have not been implemented. The legislation has not been put in place, and I find this a bit strange, given that it was passed in the House. What was passed is a weak version of what we proposed in the Police Bill in 2013 and 2014. The Taoiseach has probably brought in around 10% of the recommendations of Professor Dermot Walsh, an expert in the field. There was much talk about GSOC holding the Commissioner to account, but clearly it can only do so with the permission of the Minister of the day. This means the process remains politicised. The Taoiseach boasts about having appointed an independent police authority. The authority was to be up and running by December 2014. Last month I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, for the latest date by which the authority would be up and running, and she said she hoped to have it up and running by the end of 2015. It beggars belief that there could be such a difference between the current estimate and the original proposal that it be up and running by the end of 2014. In addition, the appointment of the chairman was a political appointment, no matter how independent the Taoiseach says it was. Likewise, the Taoiseach called the appointment of the Garda Commissioner an open competition, although we have pretty good evidence that Nóirín O'Sullivan was earmarked for the job long before any open competition started. The Taoiseach sees an independent policing authority as a cornerstone of historic police reform. I believe an independent policing authority would be historic, and would be absolutely crucial to remodelling our police force, which, sadly, seems to distance itself from an explicit and focused human rights agenda. This is core to many problems in the police force. Unless the policing authority is truly independent and completely depoliticised, many of the problems will continue. Over the past year, the Taoiseach has had a wonderful opportunity to make things different. Fine Gael has always prided itself on being the party of law and order, and there is an appetite among people for a different police force. I do not believe the Government has really grasped how much needs to be changed. I will not go into the whistleblower elements that we have not yet mentioned. It is clear that all is not well and that many problems remain in the force. GSOC, which is also crucial, now has the role of the confidential recipient but not the resources to deal with it. A garda made a complaint to GSOC in September and was told in December that the matter was being taken seriously, but he has not heard a word since, which is worrying. I am not giving out to GSOC or suggesting it is being underhanded but that it finds it difficult to do its job. GSOC is not being resourced as well as it needs to be for its challenging job. It is not yet getting the sort of co-operation required to be an effective oversight and investigative body.The Taoiseach will be aware of the fact that Deputy Daly was arrested two years and three months ago on a drink-driving charge. GSOC has been dealing with it for two years and three months and we still have not received a report on it. Here is a sample of why we have not. GSOC wrote to Deputy Daly's solicitor, stating:Unfortunately, the gardaí who were directly involved in the arrest have declined to voluntarily provide accounts or to cooperate with the GSOC investigation. I have directed that accounts be obtained from the members by use of the power of compellability contained within Section 39 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, as amended [...] Section 39 of the Act imposes on a Garda member a duty to account for any act or omission made by the member whilst on duty. A failure answer may leave the garda member subject to disciplinary action, including dismissal. We have also been unable to secure a meeting with the local District Officer. I understand that he has been periodically unavailable for personal reasons. We have been attempting to arrange this meeting [for a long time]. A number of letters and phone calls have gone unanswered since then, and consideration will now also be given to using the powers available to us under Section 39 of the Act to secure the cooperation which I consider to be necessary.  We have also experienced delay on the part of the garda authorities in responding to general documentation requests. There is a protocol between GSOC and the Garda Síochána as to how such requests are to be made and fulfilled. Under the agreement, the Garda Síochána has undertaken that "The information requested by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission will be made available as soon as practicable and in any event the information will be provided within 30 days".  Unfortunately, this undertaking has not been met. [...] I am also aware that the garda authorities appointed a Superintendent to carry out some level of internal enquiry as to the accessing of PULSE following the arrest of Deputy Daly. Thirty-three days have elapsed since I requested the identity of this Superintendent, and access to documents obtained by him/her. At time of writing, I am still unaware as to the identity of the Superintendent and do not know what level of enquiry he or she has conducted, the degree to which it might overlap the GSOC Investigation and I am still unaware as to whether the Garda Síochána is carrying out an investigation into any aspect of the arrest and the subsequent press coverage of same. This has the potential to impact adversely on the GSOC investigation. At present, there are a still number of items which the garda authorities are refusing to supply to GSOC. Further representations are being escalated to senior gardaí in accordance with the protocols between GSOC and the Garda Síochána. These delays on the part of the garda authorities have inevitably and regrettably slowed the progress of the GSOC investigation. Further efforts will be made by GSOC to secure the requested material, and I will keep you apprised of any developments.The Taoiseach will agree that this is an unsatisfactory situation, given that it has taken two years and three months and there is still no conclusion to this investigation, which one would not imagine would require unbelievable research by a great number of personnel.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	137	I agree that the situation would be far better if this matter were cleared up once and for all. I recall the issue surrounding Deputy Daly and the clarification about that. Perhaps the Deputy might be good enough to give me a copy of the document he read into the record and I will have that communicated to the Minister for Justice and Equality immediately. I am sure the Garda Commissioner herself would want to see that this matter is concluded in so far as the issues Deputy Wallace has raised are concerned. I took a few words from what the Deputy said. He indicated that we are more or less saying that commissions of investigation are out of our hands. They are, and it is not that we are just saying that now. We have always said that. Once the Cabinet approves terms of reference and they are debated and agreed by the House, or voted on by the House, the commission of investigation becomes the sole responsibility of the person in charge of it. That is not a new issue, it has always been the case, and it is perfectly clear and distinct from any responsibilities in the Chamber. The changes in the justice system that were referred to are the most extensive since the foundation of the State. The appointment of an independent policing authority speaks for itself. That is now in the process of becoming a formal entity, which is a clear decision of Government, and it puts the justice system and the Garda in a very different space from what they have occupied since 1922. I am not sure what the Deputy means when he says there seems to be a failure to get at the truth. If he wants to clarify that in a supplementary question, I would be happy to listen to him. What is it that he feels we are not looking at? Is he suggesting that there is something here which is deliberately not being analysed or investigated? I cannot accept his statement that there is pretty good evidence that the current Garda Commissioner was earmarked for the job. This was an open competition, both nationally and internationally, with a very independent interview process. That was also by decision of the Government. Garda Commissioner O'Sullivan came through that process very strongly, from the applications to the short list to acceptance by the Government. That included the shadow chairperson of the policing authority. The independent policing authority is independent. It puts the situation in a very different light from before.  The Deputy said that people still do not seem to have grasped how much it needs to be changed. However, the changes that have occurred or are in the process of occurring include the establishment of an independent policing authority; the appointment of a chairman designate; the international open competition for the Garda Commissioner; a similar open competition, which is now under way, for the appointment of Deputy Garda Commissioners; the provision of enhanced powers under GSOC; the passing of new legislation both in respect of freedom of information and of whistleblowers; and the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Act 2015, relevant to GSOC, which was enacted in March 2015 and provides for the strengthening of the powers and the functions of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman's Commission in respect of complaints, procedures and investigations. These provisions will commence very shortly. The process of appointing the Garda Commissioner was by open, international competition, and the same applies in respect of the two current vacancies at deputy commissioner level. The policing authority Bill was published last November. It was referred to the Oireachtas committee for pre-legislative scrutiny, as is now the norm. The text of that Bill will be published by the Government early in May. It is also intended to advertise for the remaining members of the authority in early May, through the Public Appointments Service, and to appoint a chief executive. That is a very significant change from the process that used to apply. If the Deputy wants to discuss his comments about pretty good evidence and a perception that there is a reluctance to get at the truth, I would be happy to respond to him.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	138	Let us get back to the actual subject of the six questions, namely, the Fennelly commission. The Taoiseach took us on a tour of the entire justice portfolio in his opening reply. To set the scene again, the reason I tabled three of these questions on the extended time requested and allowed for the Fennelly report and asking the Taoiseach whether he would make a statement on the matter is that the Taoiseach has essentially refused to answer any specific questions about the commission as it is still reporting. We must always remember that this relates to a meeting held on Monday, 24 March 2014, which the Taoiseach attended, as well as two Secretaries General, and over a year later we still do not know what were the instructions to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.In advance of the establishment of the Fennelly commission, the Taoiseach refused to give a proper, comprehensive account of what happened, and we only learned a few days after the event that he had sent the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality. There has been a fundamental lack of transparency regarding a very serious issue, namely, the forced resignation or, as I said at the time, the sacking, of a Garda Commissioner, or whatever one wants to call it. The sequence of events was blurred. We would never have needed Fennelly to investigate it had the Taoiseach been forthcoming in the House and fully transparent about all that took place. The Garda Commissioner resigned the morning after the meeting that was held in the Department of the Taoiseach. We do not know what was discussed or what directions were given to Mr. Purcell before he visited the home of the then Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan. No minutes of the meeting were kept. The former Secretary General could not attend the justice committee or answer questions there because he was going before the Fennelly commission. Although we talk about the primacy of the House, in this case the House was sidelined. When the Taoiseach was asked in a very straightforward way whether he had been called back before the Fennelly commission, he gave a long rigmarole about him not being legally allowed to say whether he had been called back and that it would be an offence to do so. The solicitor of the commission has confirmed that it would not be an offence and was unable to cite any legislation which would make it an offence for witnesses to confirm their attendance. However, the Taoiseach continued to publicly mislead everybody by saying it would be an offence to confirm his attendance. It would have been no big deal to have said he had attended the commission a second time. In the Taoiseach's reply, could he confirm whether he was called back a second time by the Fennelly commission? Overall, there has been an unhealthy unwillingness on the part of the Taoiseach to be up front and straight about what happened during the days leading up to the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner. The truth cannot harm the inquiry. As the then Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, said, the public is entitled to know the full facts surrounding the resignation of the Garda Commissioner. The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has resigned. The Secretary General of the Department has been transferred to another Department. Serious questions remain unanswered. Although the Taoiseach could have answered all the questions in the Dáil, he asked a retired Supreme Court judge to investigate the matter. The Taoiseach trotted out the line that the committee asked him to do it and he agreed. I do not buy it. This has been deliberately put on the long finger to get him out of a hole. It flies in the face of all the talk about how "Paddy likes to know" and transparency which the Taoiseach said before he came into government and was elected Taoiseach. A year and three months later the Taoiseach cannot come here and give us a straight narrative and tell it as it is. He could have done it at the time. The terms of reference of the commission state include:(n) to investigate and report on the furnishing to the Minister of a letter dated 10 March 2014 sent by the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality;(o) to investigate and report on the sequence of events leading up to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan.The Taoiseach and the Department of Justice and Equality could have covered both of the issues. It did not require the appointment of Mr. Justice Fennelly. The Taoiseach is saying the timeframe is entirely a matter for the judge. No inquiry goes on forever. I have a very straightforward question, which is contained in Deputy Wallace's question. Will we see that module of the report before the next general election? Does the Taoiseach intend that it will go on forever and that no time limits will be set for the conclusion of the report? The Taoiseach would agree that would be very unsatisfactory. The Dáil and the public have a right to know. I remember the meeting I had with the Taoiseach at the time, at which Deputy Adams was present, when the Taoiseach talked about the possible implications. The Government put out a story that court cases and convictions would be in jeopardy, which was a fog. Let us look back at the three or four days around the establishment of the Fennelly inquiry and ask some hard questions about what was happening in the Government. The Labour Party was not told anything. The former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, was very clear that the Cabinet was not alerted to anything about the possible retirement of the Garda Commissioner. The Cabinet was not told about the then Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality going to the then Garda Commissioner's house. The world was going to collapse, judicially speaking. The safety of convictions was going to be in jeopardy due to the very strong, earth-shattering potential implications of the taping of phone calls in Garda stations. This was all trotted out. The Bailey case has come and gone and the world has not collapsed. There were dark mutterings around the tapes related to that case and the repercussions if we showed certain things. There was much hype, much of it inspired by the Taoiseach. He established the inquiry on phone calls very quickly. Normally, for example in the Guerin inquiry, there is a scoping study to assess the situation before a full political investigation is established. It did not happen on this occasion. I grant that the Department of Justice and Equality was in a state of flux at the time and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, had one crisis after another and there were many controversies. The Taoiseach made up his mind and moved very quickly on the Sunday to establish the inquiry. He added on the piece about the Garda Commissioner and the letter he had sent to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality afterwards and he claimed cover from the justice committee as a rationale for doing so, which I do not buy for one moment. There comes a time, especially 15 months on, to stop hiding about this. The Taoiseach and three or four other people know what happened. Is it too much to ask for the public and the House to be told the truth?

When citizens would telephone Garda stations with comments or views, the calls were being recorded without their knowledge. This went on for so long that it is of the most serious import. The commission of investigation under Mr. Justice Fennelly faces an enormous challenge. I do not accept the Deputy's assertion in respect of the forced resignation of anybody. The Garda Commissioner is a very important position in the Constitution, and there is a process if a Government has a wish to force the retirement of a Garda Commissioner. The Deputy knows that. It applied before in the case of a previous Garda Commissioner who was removed by a Government. Does the Deputy not understand that the people I was speaking to would not have allowed such a thing to happen without the set process being put in place? Surely he does not wish to undermine the integrity of such people, even if there were any intent to do what the Deputy suggests. I do not accept the Deputy's assertion at all. I also do not accept the Deputy's assertion that there was some type of add-on, as the Deputy describes it, by the Oireachtas committee. This is a properly constituted committee of the House. It agreed unanimously to write to me and it made three requests. I complied with two of them fully but I could not comply with the third, which was to dictate to the sole member when a report might be produced. The Deputy has made comments in the past that the report, which is not yet written and was not yet written at that stage, should be published. The Deputy knows one cannot do that, because he sat around the Cabinet table when the Commission of Investigation Act was processed.

The Deputy saw his report and his letter. He indicated that he did not intend to deal with this until such time as the Bailey case was finished. That is now concluded, and a spokesperson has said it is moving on. In his letter on 17 February last, Mr. Justice Fennelly said: The Commission is at an advanced stage in its preparation of a draft interim report on these matters. In accordance with Section 34 of the Act, before the report is submitted to you as specified Minister, copies of the draft or relevant extracts thereof must be submitted to any person who is identified in or identifiable from it, in order that he or she may have the opportunity to submit statements to the Commission or applications to Court, if it is alleged that the Commission has not observed fair procedures. The Commission has at all times been mindful of the High Court proceedings currently underway involving Mr. Ian Bailey and Ms Catherine Jules Thomas who are suing An Garda Síochána, the Minister for Justice and Equality and others for false imprisonment, harassment and related claims arising out of the investigation of the murder in 1996 of Madame Sophie Toscan du Plantier. Although the Bailey and Thomas cases are not expressly mentioned in sub-paragraphs (n) and (o) of the Commission's terms of reference, they are undoubtedly related to some extent with the events that culminated in the retirement of the Commissioner. Mention of matters relating to the Bailey and Thomas cases is therefore unavoidable in the draft report concerning sub-paragraphs (n) and (o). The Commission is of the view that it would not be appropriate to submit any parts of the draft interim report to named persons whilst the High Court proceedings are at hearing. That hearing has taken much longer than had been originally estimated. The Commission is not in a position to say how much longer it [the Bailey case] will take. Accordingly, the Commission wishes to inform you as the specified Minister that the Interim Report on Terms of Reference 1(n) and (o) will not be disseminated to affected parties until after the Bailey proceedings currently at hearing have been disposed of by the High Court. [As the Deputy is aware, that is now concluded.] The timeline anticipated by the Commission in its first Interim Report must be adjusted accordingly. The broader question of whether it will ultimately prove feasible to report on 1(n) and (o) in isolation from the other Terms of Reference remains under consideration as work on the draft Interim Report progresses. The Commission will keep you informed of any decisions made in this regard.The letter is signed by the sole member of the commission, Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly. That letter of 17 February sets out the reasons, the background and the progress being made, as well as the fact that he will inform me in due course of progress or decisions made.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	183	There are two big issues here. One is the opportunity that was presented as a result of revelations about misconduct in the administration of An Garda Síochána and so forth. It was an opportunity to introduce a police service that is accountable, lives up to the sacrifice and public service of the vast majority of the members of that service and removes it from the political patronage and control which was normal here for a long time.Sinn Féin argued very strongly for An Garda Síochána to be Pattenised - for the Patten commission's approach to be adopted in relation to all of these matters. The hesitant, slow and protracted way in which the Government has gone about this has undermined that opportunity. I appeal to the Taoiseach to understand that there are issues of public confidence involved here. The Taoiseach is at the centre of the second issue I would like to raise. The difficulty is that the Fennelly commission has to send its report to him. The former Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan resigned, retired or was sacked over a year ago, on 25 March 2014. Sources close to the former Commissioner are reported in the media as saying he was left with no option and was forced out of his job, in effect, after being visited on the night of 14 March 2014 by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Brian Purcell. We know that Mr. Purcell was sent by the Taoiseach to meet the Garda Commissioner at that time. I want to put one issue to the Taoiseach very clearly. There have been countless media reports, which might be totally untrue and unfounded, that the Taoiseach was recalled by the commission to give evidence. He has refused to comment on this. He has chosen to hide behind the claim that to answer this question would be an offence, but that is patently not true. He has already said that he went and gave evidence to the commission. I have confirmed that I spoke to the commissioner. Níl rud san Acht a chuireann cosc ar an Taoiseach a rá an raibh sé mar finné agus ar ghlaodh ar ais é. Nothing in the Act prevents the Taoiseach from saying he was called back. What is the problem with being called back? This is another issue of public confidence. By refusing to give a simple confirmation, the Taoiseach ends up almost transfixed by this issue. I ask him to confirm if he was called back, or indeed if he was not. How many times has he been called to give evidence? It is not a big issue. When the Taoiseach spoke about this on a few occasions, he put it in a sort of negative way. I was listening to what he said. He said the commission could not send on its interim report until after the Bailey case. In fact, my recollection is that the commission was to send its interim report after the Bailey case to the Taoiseach, to Deputy Alan Shatter, to the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and so on. That has not happened. Unless I have misheard him, the Taoiseach has not said he will publish the draft report when he receives it. We do not know when he is going to receive it. I ask him to clear that up. If he has already answered that question, I apologise for my ignorance. It would be useful to publish the draft report and give the Dáil an opportunity to debate this issue. The Taoiseach has said that he cannot set a timetable and that any attempt to raise a question about this aspect of the matter would in some way impugn the integrity of the sole member or of the commission. That is not the case. The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recommended that the modules dealing with the departure of the former Garda Commissioner, the letter he sent to the Department of Justice and Equality and the investigation of other elements of this case should have a timetable. The terms of reference ignored that recommendation, however, by setting it to one side. In other words, the Fennelly commission is in effect open-ended. It can go on forever. That is not in the Taoiseach's interests as someone who is doing his best or in the interests of the Government. More particularly, it is not in the interests of An Garda Síochána or in the interests of public confidence in that service. Section 6 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 provides that "the power to set a commission's terms of reference includes the power to amend, at any time before the submission of the commission's final report, those terms with the consent or at the request of the commission for the purpose of clarifying, limiting or extending the scope of its investigation." Therefore, it is not too late to amend the terms of reference and to set a fixed timeframe. Will the Taoiseach consider amending the terms of reference to set a clear timeframe for the completion of the Fennelly commission of investigation? The Taoiseach has nine minutes and 50 seconds. He can talk the clock down. He can waffle and go through all of this, or he can answer in a few brief remarks the two questions I have put to him. First, was he recalled to the commission? Second, will he consider putting in place a clear timeframe, as he is permitted to do under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004? By answering these two straightforward and simple questions, he can clear up these issues, allow the work of the Government and the Garda Síochána to proceed and, in particular, uphold public confidence in the handling of this issue by Taoiseach and his Government. I refer particularly to the work being done by the people who are out there on the beat protecting citizens and keeping public order.

Those are the words used by the Deputy. The Government decided to establish an independent policing authority and to have a Garda Commissioner appointed on foot of a public advertisement by means of international competition and selection. This process, which is also being used for the deputy commissioners, differs significantly from the process that had been applied since the foundation of the State in regard to the appointments made. I disagree entirely with the Deputy's suggestion that the Government has undermined that opportunity. The Government considered the process that was under way in Northern Ireland when Mr. Patten was put in charge of dealing with the structure and the propositions for that. We decided there was a different requirement here. The fundamental issue in so far as the Garda is concerned is that we now have an independent policing authority, enhanced powers for the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, an independent process of selection of and reporting by the Garda Commissioner and independent processes for the deputy commissioners. All of that differs significantly from what used to be applied.

I have already given my view on this. I received correspondence from the commission in the same way as other people did and I responded to that in writing and in evidence to the commission. I am not going further than that. When the commission's final report is received by me, it will be published by me as the sponsoring Minister in accordance with the law. The Deputy said it was not a big issue but he started off by saying that it was a big issue. He made the point that this could not have been dealt with until after the Bailey case. That decision was made clearly by Justice Fennelly and not by anybody else. He made that decision and he is in sole control of this commission of investigation.  People say they want this dealt with in this House or by an Oireachtas committee or that they want an independent investigation but when there is an independent commission of investigation, they want it to be dealt with their way. The terms of reference were debated, approved and, indeed, amended by the House. A unanimous request was made, and a letter was sent to me, by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which Deputy Martin called an "add-on", asking that the terms of reference be amended so that these two elements would be investigated by the commission of investigation. I agreed with that request and I also made the point that I, no more than the committee or anybody else, was not in a position to dictate to the sole member but that if it were possible for him to bring forward an interim report on these two matters at an earlier date, he should do so if he considered it appropriate and relevant. The commission's terms were amended to take into account the formal unanimous request by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and that was debated in the House.  I cannot indicate to the Deputy when I expect to receive the final report because Justice Fennelly said in his letter that he did not propose to send sections of the interim report to persons who were spoken to by the commission until such time as the Bailey case was disposed of. It has now been disposed of and, as I said to Deputy Martin, a spokesperson from the commission said it was proceeding with the drafting of the interim report. I assume the process in terms of commissions of investigation will be rigorously applied by the judge. As I said to Deputies, when the report is received by me, I will publish it. Just because I happen to be the sponsoring Minister of this commission of investigation does not allow for that not to happen. When Justice Fennelly submits his final report, I will publish it. I cannot answer Deputy Adams's question as to when that will be, nor can I say to him or to Deputy Martin if it will be before the next general election. The Government has a great deal of work to do to secure the recovery of the economy for our people. We have to prepare the spring economic statement and make preparations for the Estimates and a budget.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	223	I wish to ask the Taoiseach about legislation relating to health. Page 4 of the programme for Government states: "A system of universal health insurance will be introduced by 2016, with the legislative and organisational groundwork for the system complete within this Government's term of office." It is now April 2015. Can the Taoiseach confirm that legislative promise will not now be achieved and that the commitments will not be realised within the Government's term of office? Can he further confirm that universal health insurance, with a public or private insurer, will be compulsory with insurance payments related to ability to pay? Will that happen between now and the general election? When can we expect the universal primary care Bill? Does the Taoiseach envisage it coming into being within the next 12 months? When can we expect the integrated care agency to be established? I have been pursuing this for quite some time and getting very little in the form of confirmation. It is more than four years since the programme for Government was published. It stated that investment in the supply of more and better care for older people in the community and residential sectors will be a priority of the Government. What has actually happened in the past three to four years are reductions. There have been reductions in fair deal allocations and in the number of home helps, many of whom only get half an hour or 40 minutes with the people they are looking after. We were told we would get more home care packages but we are getting fewer. We were told there would be a review of the fair deal scheme and we have asked time and again on the Order of Business for the publication of that review, or a timeline for its publication, only to be stalled every time. I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach would indicate definitively when we can expect the review. On primary care, there remains a fundamental issue in terms of the extension of the medical card and access to primary care without fees for those who are chronically ill or have long-term illnesses. The programme for Government stated that access to primary care without fees would be extended in the first year to claimants of free drugs under the long-term illness scheme. It also stated that access to primary care without fees would be extended in the second year to claimants of free drugs under the high-tech drugs scheme and that access to subsidised care would be extended to all in the next phase, while access to care without fees would be extended to all in the final phase.About four or five pages in the programme for Government are devoted to health. I have asked the Taoiseach on numerous occasions when we can expect all the proposals contained in this document to be realised. I have received long letters in response and the over-riding conclusion is that very little of it will be implemented before this Government's term ends. Would the Taoiseach accept that this is a sham, that the section pertaining to health in the programme for Government is completely illusory and that if someone came down from Mars, read it and compared it to the reality over the past five years, they would be left scratching their head? I have not even gone into bioethics. It is said that assisted human reproduction, stem cell research, post-mortem procedures, organ retention and organ donation and an opt-out system will be legislated for but none of this will happen. The patient safety authority is not happening. There is an obligation to at least commit to ditching these five or six pages because they are completely illusory and are misleading the public in terms of the rhetoric and the reality. Could the Taoiseach answer in terms of the specifics of the legislation about which I asked?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	224	Universal health insurance will not be introduced in the lifetime of this Government. On taking office, the Minister for Health reflected very carefully on the timeframes set out for health reform. He pointed out last July that he determined that while good progress had been made in implementing health reform, the original timeframe for full implementation of universal health insurance was too ambitious. He pointed out that notwithstanding this, the Government remains committed to its major programme of health reform and plans to continue to press ahead with those main foundations for universal health care. This includes the phased extension of GP care without fees; implementing a number of key financial reforms, including activity-based funding; the establishment of hospital groups; and improved chronic care management. Hospital groups, primary care centres and the GP card system for children aged under six and people aged over 70 are part of the foundation necessary for universal health insurance in addition to the requirement for people to take out private health insurance based on age limits. This is all under way. The Government recently allocated €75 million for home care packages and the fair deal scheme in order to reduce the waiting list from 18 weeks to approximately five weeks. This seems to be working well. Obviously, we hope this is managed in the best interests of the patients. The integrated care agency is part of the Government's commitment to reform of the health service. Future Health referred to the agency as the health care commissioning agency and this agency will be charged with driving performance improvement in health services through value-based purchasing. The Minister is reviewing how best to develop the structure that is required to replace the HSE - I know Deputy Martin's party now has a different view - including the question of a health care commissioning agency. Future Health set the broad direction of travel for reforming the health system and made it clear that an incremental, phased approach to implementation was taking place. This is just one of number of structural changes envisaged under Future Health. Others include hospital groups, community health care organisations, a health care pricing office and the commencement of activity-based funding. The Minister intends to build on these as part of the wider structural reform agenda. However, the complexity and scale of the issues to be addressed require detailed preparatory policy work to provide the basis for legislative proposals. The next incremental step in that process will be to develop policy on a health care commissioning model in an Irish context.  In respect of the review of home care, the HSE is progressing a range of measures to improve the position overall. Providers are monitored through service-level agreements with the HSE. They are supervised through local and regular operational meetings and the review of care plans for individual patients. The HSE is undertaking a full review of home care services with a view to improving services generally. This includes national quality guidelines, which will apply to all home support services, including those procured by the HSE from external providers.  If I have left anything out, I will respond to Deputy Martin.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	225	Could the Taoiseach tell the Dáil when the Government will move the writ for the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election? There is a vacancy there. The previous Government was forced by Deputy Pearse Doherty's High Court action to call by-elections within six months so I would like to know when the people of that constituency will have the opportunity to elect a Deputy to represent them. My other questions concern the working group on Seanad reform, the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015 and the health (transport support) Bill. Mar is eol don Leas-Cheann Comhairle, an tseachtain seo caite d'fhoilsigh an grúpa oibre maidir le athchóiriú an tSeanaid a thuarascáil. This report falls far short of what Sinn Féin and others believe is needed to make the Seanad a genuinely democratic and representative elected Chamber mostly because of the restricted terms of reference it was given. The fact that the Taoiseach retains the privilege of appointing 11 nominees is wrong. Other issues include the failure to deal with university representation, gender equality or the representation of ethnic groups, particularly the Traveller community. The numbers to be elected by universal suffrage are too small. Having said all that, when will the Dáil have the opportunity to debate this report and when does the Taoiseach expect the Government to produce legislation?  Tá ceist eile agam faoi Acht atá an-tábhachtach, namely, the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015. We are told that this Bill is about making school enrolment more structured, fair and transparent. It also provides that a school will not discriminate on the basis of religion but if I understand it properly, it then goes on to provide for discrimination by allowing schools to refuse to admit certain children in order to maintain the ethos of the school so this means a school can still discriminate based on religion or faith. The Minister for Education and Skills has also said that she favours allowing schools to admit 10% of pupils if their parents are past pupils. Clearly, this also discriminates against children who do not have that distinction. What is the Taoiseach's view of this and has the Government set a date for the Second Stage reading of this Bill? I have raised the next issue many times with the Taoiseach. I have noticed over the past few months that the Government is almost ticking boxes with regard to issues that have been raised here. These are very important issues that do not cost an awful lot of money. It is almost as if the Government is trying to close down these issues of discontent as it prepares for the general election. The health (transport support) Bill is a major injustice. In 2013, the Government closed the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant, affecting 5,000 citizens and their families.I have raised this with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions and he has acknowledged that what is happening is wrong. The excuse given by the Minister at the time was that the Government could not afford to keep the scheme open. It is interesting that this was brought to the attention of the Dáil because it was ruled to be in breach of equality laws. We were told that the issue would be resolved by the health (transport support) Bill. Two years later, there has been no progress. Two years later, these people are still being denied this necessary grant. According to the legislative programme, it is not possible to indicate when this Bill will be published. Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify for the House when the health (transport support) Bill will be published. Address of this issue would not cost the Government or taxpayer a great deal of money but would alleviate great difficulties for these citizens and their families.

I cannot give him a specific date in regard to publication of that Bill. It is included in the legislative programme for this year, under legislation relating to the Department of Health. Work in respect of the drafting of the proposals for primary legislation is well advanced but it has not yet come to the Government. The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published on 8 April. No date for the taking of that legislation in the House has yet been agreed. It is a matter for the Whips to agree on a time for debate of that Bill in the Dáil. I noted the comments of the Minister at the recent teachers' meetings on this matter.  The by-election for Carlow-Kilkenny will take place on 22 May, the writ for which will be moved by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in good time to allow for an enthusiastic, vibrant and energetic campaign in that regard. That will happen in the near future.  In regard to the Seanad working group, this group was tasked by me to work under the chairmanship of former Seanad Leader, Maurice Manning. The group comprises members nominated by party leaders to represent their parties. The people made their decision in respect of the retention of the Seanad. The terms of reference of the group include an examination of the electoral system and the work programme that might be possible for the Seanad, but within constitutional parameters so as not to require a further referendum. The people decided, albeit by a narrow majority, to retain the Seanad. The question of the number of Members to be appointed to the Seanad by the Taoiseach of the day is enshrined in the Constitution. As such, no change in that regard can be made without a referendum. The group was asked to work within the constitutional parameters. The report presented by the group to me, and to everybody else, is radical, innovative and exciting in the sense of what could be achieved in respect of Seanad Éireann. I hope to meet with the party leaders on the matter. The group is due to appear before an Oireachtas committee shortly to give a presentation on its work and propositions. I understand it will also make a presentation on its report to the Seanad in the next fortnight or in the very near future. The potential work programme outlined by the group is also very interesting.

Some 20 months later, there is still no sign of this happening. What is the reason for the delay in progressing this Bill, and will the Taoiseach give a commitment to prioritise the promise by the Government to introduce a deposit protection scheme?

The Taoiseach might advise us as to whether the spring statement will be announced here in the Dáil and on what date will that be. Will there be statements from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform? Will it follow normal budget day announcements where a response from the Opposition will be facilitated? Will the Taoiseach give us some indication so that Members have an opportunity to prepare? If there are to be responses from the Opposition, will he ensure on this occasion that the two Ministers involved have the courtesy to remain in the Dáil to hear some of the statements? In the past two budgets, they upped and left the Chamber to head off to God knows where and did not even listen to the response to their budget day speeches. I ask the Taoiseach to ensure, if that is to happen next week, the Ministers remain in the Chamber at least to hear what is being said.

I am very concerned. There is a third force acting in the country. I got a telephone call that night at 3 a.m. when that situation arose and there were members of the Garda, including a superintendent, present. I am worried that gardaí are being forced into these situations. They have told me they have to go but the Garda superintendent failed to produce a warrant to the housewife that night. This was a terrorist act, as far as I am concerned, observed by gardaí. I have two affidavits in my office, which I will hand to the Taoiseach, about surveillance by gardaí for two weeks prior to this.

I contacted the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, the morning after. She is aware of it. This is not acceptable in any democracy. Deputy Ó Fearghaíl said it is like Zimbabwe. It is definitely like it, or Libya. It is outrageous that hooded men, accompanied by unmuzzled dogs, are trespassing across lands, including those of other landowners. The second piece of legislation I want to ask the Taoiseach about also involves the Garda. A former eminent Supreme Court judge last week used a member of the Garda to promote an issue in the forthcoming referendum. It is despicable. Gardaí have to be, and have been, impartial in all cases and we all support them 100%, but they cannot be used and abused by receivers and, in this case, by persons supporting nothing other than a "Yes" vote in the campaign. The former judge knew well what she was doing - maybe the innocent gardaí did not know what they were doing - and the response from the Minister and the Garda Representative Association has been pathetic. It is a misuse of the Garda Síochána which should be allowed to be impartial and above reproach.

That was the issue that was raised by the community and by the Oireachtas Members who were present at that public meeting. On a second issue, on the discussion that the Government seems to be having about promised legislation in the area of bankruptcy and in the context of the spring statement, is it the Taoiseach's intention to bring forward legislation to reduce the period of bankruptcy from three years to one year? Will the legislation amend some other matters in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency for individuals to give them a reasonable time span of one year and enable them to get back actively in the economy again? I raised the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996 on the Order of Business previously. Commercial vehicle body builders are encountering serious difficulty getting clearances through the National Standards Authority of Ireland and I ask the Taoiseach to intervene again. Something must be done in relation to staffing levels in the authority and the clearing of certificates that are necessary to sell on the vehicles. It is causing difficulty for that sector.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	295	The repossession issue, I understand, is a Topical Issue later on. The Government has already stated that it intends to bring forward a number of measures dealing with mortgage distress and repossession of houses in order to ensure that, where possible, borrowers retain their houses, whether that be through the mortgage-to-rent scheme being changed or whether there is an issue in respect of an independent assessment of structured propositions being put forward. That is separate from the question of bankruptcy being reduced from three years to one. Deputy McGuinness will be aware that when the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, brought the Bill through the House to reduce it from 12 years to three, there was no great division on whether it should be three or one.However, I would caution that Deputy Penrose's Bill was presented to the House and was not objected to, and I was in the House. The information available to me is that where bankruptcy applies, 70% of cases end up with repossessions of the house, which is not what the Government is about or what anyone wants to see. In addition to that, I believe the Oireachtas committee should certainly look at this question. We should take into account all the small and medium-sized enterprises and the credit unions which are owed money. They would lose and the taxpayer would have to pay for all of that. It is not as simple as it seems to say that a reduction from three years to one year is a panacea for all these issues. The evidence is that in bankruptcies, repossessions occur in 70% of cases. How many people running small businesses in Kilkenny, Cork or Clare or how many credit unions throughout the country which are owed money would lose out completely if we had a system whereby a debtor could decide that he or she is getting out and declaring bankruptcy? Those people would lose out. It might be an issue for the committee to have some hearings on this and to get first-hand evidence of what might happen. I am sure people do not want to get into a situation where unintended consequences mean that more and more people could be caught by having this apply. I see certain people applying pressure now that this Bill be introduced automatically. A well-known and well-publicised case is currently being considered. I understand many millions are owed in that case. If bankruptcy applies, then clearly there are serious losses on that scale. It is not an answer to everyone's problem. Perhaps the Oireachtas committee could do a very useful exercise here in looking at those issues, for example, in respect of small and medium-sized enterprises, credit unions and smaller contractors which are owed money but which will not get it if there is a simplicity factor whereby a debtor can decide to become bankrupt and say "Tally-ho".

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	297	I thank the Minister for his attendance. Throughout Cork city, the county and the region there is great concern about the situation pertaining to Cork Airport. The recent announcement by Aer Lingus Regional is a further blow to the situation at the airport. There has been a serious decline in the number of flights to and from Cork. Obviously, this will have a negative impact on the tourism industry and the economic and industrial future for the region. In recent years, Cork Airport's traffic or passenger numbers have fallen by approximately 40%, which is rather dramatic. Last year alone saw a reduction of 6.6% in passengers to the airport. Next year, the airport authority is projecting a 5% decline. Action is required because 2015 will be worse. Aer Lingus and Ryanair have announced the cancellation of routes on top of a reduction of further flights to continental Europe, including the ending of the Cork to Lisbon, Cork to Nice and Cork to Brussels routes. Passenger numbers are now at 2 million. We cannot blame it exclusively on the downturn and we cannot blame it on the motorway or the associated improvements, as some do - I understand the Minister has suggested this recently. Shannon Airport passenger numbers have gone up 18.7% and those in Dublin have gone up by 6.5%. I believe we can trace this back to the decision in 2012. I am certain Cork Airport is not operating on a level playing pitch. The reconstitution of Shannon Airport under a separate State company with Shannon Development and the rental revenues that flow from Shannon Development have put Shannon in a strong competitive position. Good luck to Shannon in that regard. Its debt burden has also been written off to the tune of €100 million. Essentially, it is in a position to offer far better prices to airlines than Cork Airport. This is not something I am saying; officials of the Dublin Airport Authority are saying it. In fact, one thing that concerned me when I met DAA officials was that they were reluctant to go public because they were fearful of the political repercussions. The DAA seems to have been rather muted until relatively recently on this issue. Certain legislation was brought in at the time. The Government abolished the Cork Airport Authority, although the legislation allows for it to be re-established. Essentially, it is part of the DAA structure now. It is clear that Cork Airport lacks a strong independent advocate and is very much subservient to the DAA's diktat. In the context of the Booz report and the legislation, Cork Airport was never really given any new lease of life by the Government and it is at a severe disadvantage now. The Government directly intervened elsewhere. I have no doubt the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was influential in terms of the Shannon situation. Shannon Airport can offer deals to Ryanair that Cork Airport cannot. That is fine except it does not add any value to the country. That is the bottom line. Approximately 100,000 passengers were going through Cork and they are now going to Shannon because of the deals that can be offered. That is what DAA officials are saying behind the scenes. They are clear and straightforward about it. Therefore, the pitch must be levelled somehow in terms of facilitating growth in Cork. There is no way that the airport can prevent the diversion of services as a result of the incentive pricing that is going on. In particular, Ryanair, as a low-cost airline, has diverted a good deal of its traffic to the airport down the road. There is no doubt that substantial discounts, success fees and marketing payments are all factors in that change. I believe it is a race-to-the-bottom model and one the Government should reflect on and change tack in terms of ensuring a feasible long-term future for Cork Airport. One step I recommend to the Minister is for the Cork Airport board to be re-established. At least that would allow for a strong board that could advocate for Cork Airport, in particular. That would mitigate the sense, which is now very strong in the region, that certain issues are being muted because of the DAA's relationship with the Department and its political masters, that DAA officials are not allowed to raise awkward questions and that they do not want to publicly articulate awkward questions. A route development fund is essential for Cork Airport, or else a regional support fund for tourism activities in the region. Something has to happen to redress the current imbalance between the three airports. Route development funds have been successful in the past in developing regional airports and increasing connectivity elsewhere, including Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and northern England. The Government should seriously consider ways and means of redressing this otherwise the situation will continue to decline. It is not sustainable in the current framework that operates throughout the three State airports. A route development fund and an independent authority should be considered.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	298	I thank Deputy Martin for raising this matter. I am very much aware of the importance of this matter. The interest he has is shared with his constituency colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, Deputy Jerry Buttimer and Deputy Ciarán Lynch. Before I comment on the importance of Cork Airport and our plans for it, I emphasise that the market for air services in the European Union is fully liberalised. Any European registered airline is free to operate any service between any two points in the European Union. It is, therefore, a matter for airlines, including Aer Lingus Regional or Stobart Air, to decide what routes they service based on their commercial judgments.I have no involvement in those decisions. My understanding is that while Stobart will be reducing frequency on some routes, it is also increasing capacity on others or resuming summer services, as all airlines do over the year, depending on seasonality and passenger demand. In particular, the airline will recommence its twice-weekly summer services to Jersey and Rennes from Cork in early June. The Government is very conscious of the importance of Cork Airport. It is the second largest airport in Ireland and vital for business and tourism in the Cork region. With all this focus on and discussion about declining passenger numbers, let us not forget that it still had more than 2.1 million passengers last year, has 42 scheduled routes and offers passengers excellent connectivity into three major European hub airports. The airport has excellent passenger facilities and provides award-winning customer services. Notwithstanding all of that, I am also very aware of, and concerned about, the continuing decline in passenger numbers at the airport. Since becoming Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have met all the stakeholders in Cork Airport on a number of occasions and have engaged extensively with Government bodies in the matter. The DAA and Cork Airport management are working hard to stabilise passenger numbers and restore Cork Airport to growth in the short to medium term. The DAA is actively engaged with existing airline customers, including Stobart, and potential new entrants to help expand traffic at the airport and generate new services. It is crucial that existing and new services are, therefore, supported by the people in Cork and the wider catchment area to ensure their sustainability. I believe there are also opportunities to increase the number of incoming tourists in the Cork region, particularly in view of the fact that only 37% of Cork Airport's passengers are inbound, which is quite low by international standards. I have engaged with Tourism Ireland, which has undertaken significant co-operative marketing activity with carriers serving Cork Airport to promote flights to Cork and boost travel to the wider regions. East Cork will also be promoted as part of the new tourism proposition for the south and east of Ireland, Ireland's Ancient East. Cork city and airport now have the opportunity to act as a gateway to both Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way. Ultimately, creating new services and growing inbound tourism depends not just on the availability of competitive access but also on ensuring that potential visitors have a reason to visit. I urge everybody to work together to develop these products in the Munster region, not just around the airport. The stakeholders, along with the airport and the tourism agencies, will then be better able to pursue every opportunity to develop and highlight those products. It is only by working together that the objective of ensuring a sustainable airport that is able to grow in the future can be achieved for the benefit of the region, the city and the county.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	299	I am very disappointed with the Minister's response because it is a holding response and does not deal with the core issue. There are three State airports, and one need only look at the structure to see the issue. Cork Airport is at a competitive disadvantage because of the way the Government has structured the three airports in terms of governance and supports to the respective airports. Essentially, there was a reorganisation of Shannon Airport, with Shannon Development, the rental revenues and all of that, but there is no corresponding structure for Cork Airport or any other supporting mechanism in terms of where it stands within the DAA group. That is a fundamental issue with regard to its capacity to offer competitive rates to airlines. The other key issue is industry. The region is home to some of the biggest names in global technology, from EMC to Apple, and the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. The Minister knows that airline connectivity is a very important factor in terms of the capacity to bring in foreign direct investment. There is huge concern about the continuing decline of the airport's passenger numbers. It is a fine airport which is number one in the world in terms of its customer relations - it has received awards in that regard. However, all of this will have an impact on FDI eventually if we do not have that international and global connectivity. That is a big issue of concern for people in the region, particularly those in industry and business. It is also important in the context of the country's spatial planning. Everyone is talking about the two-tier economic recovery in the sense that everything is happening in the Dublin region and very little outside it. Our second largest airport is now being essentially undermined and downgraded because of the structures that have been put in place, inadvertently or otherwise - I do not know which. The Minister from Cork, Deputy Coveney, must have been asleep at the table or been considerably out-muscled by other Ministers in this regard, but the outcomes are clear in terms of what is happening on the ground. The airline charges offered by Cork Airport are quite competitive across the European landscape, and I have no difficulty with the position of Shannon and Dublin airports, but when we see the other airport going in the opposite direction, surely that raises alarm bells in the Department and with the Minister which call for action. Does the Minister intend to bring in a route development fund?

In his reaction, what he fails to acknowledge in any way is the engagement I have had to support this airport. I have met both the DAA and local management within Cork Airport on many different occasions. If I looked at the different matters the Deputy has raised, I would point to the fact that Tourism Ireland, as I said in my reply, is working with Cork Airport to land routes and that new routes have recently been landed at the airport. I met with the management of Cork Airport only weeks ago to review with them the efforts they have made to bring in new routes and bring new access to the airport. I have already acknowledged to the Deputy, as I have to many of his colleagues within the region, that I am concerned about the trend that is evident there. I want to see Cork Airport increase its passenger numbers in the future for reasons of supporting investment in the region and supporting tourism in the area and beyond. I point to the support we have given it in the recent past. We have now launched a new proposition, Ireland's Ancient East, to respond to some of the points that have been made within the Deputy's county regarding the need to better support different tourism assets within the area. A crucial reason for this is the need to find ways to generate more demand within that region, which in turn will support this airport. In terms of specific supports that I and State agencies are providing to the airport, I have engaged directly with the management of Cork Airport and Tourism Ireland is working directly with them to support their efforts to bring in new routes in what I know is a competitive environment. The Deputy himself acknowledged that the rates Cork Airport is offering are competitive versus many of its European peers. In that environment, with the support that Tourism Ireland is giving to the airport-----

It is striking to hear the Deputy talk about his own airport being downgraded. This is a Government that has supported tourism in a way no Fianna Fáil Government ever did, and has got rid of measures such as the airport travel tax, which Deputy Martin's Government brought in. That has now resulted in a huge transformation in the number of visitors into and out of the country, and a huge step change in tourism within our country.

#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	312	I thank the Minister, Deputy Reilly, for taking this Topical Issue. I am aware that he spoke on this topic in the past week or so and I very much welcome his commitment to ensuring the school completion programme is maintained. Having said that, it is a reality that the co-ordinators of these programmes have received no certainty or clarity from Tusla or the Minister. They have not been informed as to whether there will be further reductions in funding next year or dramatic, deep-rooted change to the programme, or whether it will be overhauled entirely. That is causing a lot of stress. I recently met nine principals from DEIS schools in my constituency and our local co-ordinator on the question of the future and security of the school completion programme. They have gone through a very turbulent time, which goes without saying, in terms of a reduction in funding. They have moved from a model of part-funding from the European Union to the Department of Education and Skills, and are now under the umbrella of Tusla. There has been a lot of chopping and changing, which has contributed to the sense of uncertainty. The service nationally has experienced a substantial cut in funding from €32.9 million in 2008 to €24.7 million in 2014. It is fair to say that while everybody understands the enormous economic challenges the State has faced since 2008, it is essential that the most vulnerable in our society are protected. It is also essential that programmes that are proven to produce results are protected, that their funding is ring-fenced and that they are supported and grow. That has to be a priority and I would very much welcome any statement from the Minister in that regard, in terms of a commitment to expanding and continuing the school completion programme because it is working. I know from first-hand experience in my constituency, which has some of the most deprived areas in the whole country, that children who are extremely vulnerable to mitching school and early school leaving benefit from this programme. It is working and all of the principals in all of the schools in my constituency would back that up 100%, as would teachers. We are awaiting the result of an ESRI report on this matter. I understand it was due in March and has still not been forthcoming. It has not been published; I am not sure whether it has been provided to the Minister or Tusla but it has not been made public. It is anxiously awaited and, incidentally, ties in with the very good and comprehensive report the ESRI published in recent weeks on the overarching challenges facing DEIS schools. It was a wide-ranging report which investigated the effectiveness or otherwise of DEIS schools. An interesting recommendation, which I am sure the Minister has read in detail, is the concentration of resources on band 1 schools in urban areas, which are the most vulnerable and where, unfortunately, the least amount of progress is being made. The ESRI recommendation focuses on DEIS schools but there is a reference to the school completion programme. It very clearly and concretely recommends the concentration of resources in the most vulnerable schools in urban areas. I would like to hear whether the Minister would support a similar focus in terms of the school completion programme, that is, the concentration of resources in the most vulnerable areas. It is logical and is what this programme is all about, namely, ensuring that every citizen, in particular every child in our State, is cherished and has equal opportunities. We know that is not the case. The ESRI report on DEIS schools tells us what we already know, but it is worth reiterating. DEIS schools are more likely to have students who come from unskilled, manual or non-employed households, parents who have lower levels of education and families with lower household incomes. Children in such schools are more likely to come from lone parent families. There is a range of factors which are entirely predictable and mean these children are more vulnerable and require much greater intervention. I am very keen to hear the Minister's thoughts on that report and how it directly affects the programme.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	313	I thank the Deputy for her question. The school completion programme aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to improve the school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort. It is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills DEIS action plan. It involves 124 projects and related initiatives operating in 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools. These projects provide a range of supports and interventions designed to support approximately 36,000 children identified by local management committees as being at risk of educational disadvantage. Typically, projects offer homework clubs, breakfast clubs, mentoring programmes, learning support, social and personal development programmes, out-of-school supports, including music, art and sports, and a range of activities during holiday periods. Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has had operational responsibility for the school completion programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, an allocation of €24.756 million was provided for the school completion programme. The agency has indicated a similar allocation for the programme in 2015. It has approved local projects school retention plans for the 2014-15 academic year. The first two instalments of 2014-15 funding have issued to local projects, with a third instalment planned for next month. The Deputy may be aware that a review of the school completion programme by the ESRI is almost complete, a point to which she alluded. The review is an important initiative in regard to planning for the future development of the school completion programme. The review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future. The review is being overseen by a steering committee involving officials of the Child and Family Agency, my Department and the Department of Education and Skills. The review will, among other things, examine the school completion programme structures and their fitness for purpose to support an integrated approach to address early school leaving. It will analyse the interventions provided and make recommendations for evidence-informed supports designed to secure the best educational outcomes for children and young people. It is envisaged that its final report will be delivered very shortly. The Minister for Education and Skills recently published an evaluation of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, or DEIS, programme which was also prepared by the ESRI, and which refers to the school completion programme as an integral support within DEIS in improving attendance and engagement in education, something the Deputy mentioned in her remarks. I would like to reiterate that I have advised the agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the school completion programme services. The school completion programme is an important service within the agency's educational welfare services. It is, as Deputy Creighton and many other Deputies have said over the past number of months, a highly regarded programme and a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving. As we all know, the longer one stays in education, the better education one will have and the better one's prospects in life will be in terms of the ability to earn a living.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	314	I thank the Minister for his response. I appreciate the specific funding that has been allocated for the 2014-15 academic year, which he outlined. The fear among co-ordinators of the school completion programme concerns the funding for the academic year 2015-16, which is fast approaching. When people are trying to plan for September and trying to put in place the various elements of the programme, they need to know they have some certainty. The concern is over the delay in the publication of the ESRI report. Perhaps the Minister will be able to inform the House when exactly that report will be published. Perhaps he will indicate how long it will take for him to consider the report and, ultimately, take decisions on the future of the programme so there can be clarity and certainty for the schools, children, their families and the co-ordinators of the programme. It is really a question of the funding for next year and how long it will take until there is certainty in that regard. My other question, which I appreciate the Minister did not yet have a chance to address, concerns a recommendation in the ESRI report on DEIS schools pertaining to the concentration of resources on the most disadvantaged areas. We do not know whether the Minister for Education and Skills will accept the recommendation but I certainly hope she will. Does the Minister envisage a similar concentration of resources, focused on the most disadvantaged children and areas, for the school completion programme? To me, it is logical and makes sense. It will ensure the most vulnerable children are protected and provide the sorts of supports they need to ensure they can continue in education and not miss school. It will ultimately ensure they have better opportunities in life.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	315	I thank the Deputy for her question. It is clear to me, given the number of times this specific issue has arisen in the Topical Issue debate, that it is a matter of great concern to many Deputies and that its value is very clear to them. I believe in the programme. It has tremendous value and goes a long way towards levelling the playing pitch to ensure children at risk of finishing school earlier than they should will remain in the educational process. As one goes around the country and examines the various areas in which the programme is implemented, and the various ways in which it is implemented, one realises it is important that the co-ordinators follow the lead of the students themselves and find out from them what they are interested in. They should use this knowledge as a means of leading the students back into education and explain to them that if they had a better understanding of mathematics or another subject, they would be better able to pursue their interest in a certain area, be it carpentry, cookery or another practice. I have visited some of the programmes and noted they are very well run and are keeping children in school. On the issue of concentrating resources in the areas of most disadvantage and need, that has clearly been the focus of this particular back to school completion programme. Although the early childhood and child care education programme is universal and highly regarded by parents, with 95% of the cohort of eligible children participating, the children who gain most from it are actually the ones from the most disadvantaged areas. They catch up on reading skills, etc., when they get into class. Before this programme was in place, there was often a 30-point difference between those from more advantaged areas and those from less advantaged areas. I hope that helps answer the question.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	316	I am disappointed the Minister for Finance is not present, as he was in the House earlier. The first two Topical Issue debates were taken by the relevant line Minister. When I first started raising this issue with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, he told me IBRC operated at arm’s length from the State. As I probed deeper, he conceded his Department was concerned about the Siteserv deal but that he was satisfied it was in the best interest of the State. When I pushed further, he eventually admitted that far from being satisfied, his Department actually conducted a full review of the deal and that following that review, the Department made a decision to second one of its officials to the board of IBRC to provide greater oversight. Six months later, IBRC was wound up in a very rushed fashion. Today, I received freedom of information documents from the Department of Finance which show not only that the Minister was not satisfied the deal was the best one for the State but that he believed the deal resulted in a less than optimum return for the bank and, by extension, the State. That conflicts with the original reply, which is a serious issue in its own right. I have been raising these concerns because when I started examining how the lucrative Irish Water metering contract had been awarded, the trail led me back to the IBRC sale to Siteserv, whose subsidiary, Sierra, went on to win the metering contract, and to the Denis O’Brien-owned Millington. That led me to a web of potential conflicts of interest which I am still trying to understand. I refer to people such as Mr. Richard Woodhouse, the head of specialised asset management in IBRC, who also managed the Siteserv account and the personal borrowings of the Siteserv CEO, Brian Harvey, as well as being a personal friend of Denis O'Brien. That brings me to Davy. There was one Davy adviser advising five Siteserv board members. The same legal firm, Arthur Cox, was advising or working on behalf of both seller and buyer in this deal. I have tabled parliamentary questions but they have not been replied to, so I am asking questions here. I have been told by a whistleblower, although I am open to hearing the Minister of State’s version of this, that Millington was not even considered in the first round of bids and that Millington received a letter from the aforementioned Mr. Richard Woodhouse informing it that it needed to change its bid if it was to be considered in the second round. Millington added a €5 million cash sweetener for the shareholders to the bid and Millington was successful. The memo I got through freedom of information today again reiterates the point and the Minister’s concern that the decision to exclude trade buyers was serious. It is even more serious in the context of the metering contract which was later won. Earlier today the Taoiseach told this House that the relationship framework governing the transaction was the 2009 framework, which did not require IBRC to involve the Department in the transaction. However, the freedom of information documents show that negotiations for the implementation of the new framework were ongoing for some time prior to that. I believe there were approximately 30 versions of it prior to the Siteserv deal. It came into effect two weeks after the conclusion of the deal. The documents further suggest that IBRC's CEO, Mike Aynsley, and the board resisted the implementation of the new framework at every hand’s turn until the Siteserv deal was concluded. I need to have an answer to that. IBRC had been told by the Department to act as if the framework were in place earlier than when the Siteserv deal was concluded. Why did it not do so? Did Mr. Alan Dukes, as chairman of IBRC, ignore the instruction to act as if the framework were in place? The strange relationships and extremely fractious relationship between the Department and IBRC and the concerns surrounding the Siteserv transaction and other large transactions raise serious questions about the real reasons underpinning the eventual "prom night" in which IBRC was wound down in a very hurried fashion.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	317	I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising the issue. I am grateful to have an opportunity to place some information on this matter on the record of the House. On 15 March 2012, the board of IBRC met and approved the sale of Siteserv. Under the relationship framework that was in place between the Minister for Finance and the bank at that time, which had been place since July 2009, the board of IBRC was required to engage with the Minister for Finance on certain key issues, which included "any material acquisitions, disposals, investments, realisations or other transactions, other than in the ordinary course of Anglo Irish Bank's banking business."It should be noted that this relationship framework did not include any specific monetary thresholds which would trigger mandatory consultation with the Minister for Finance. It should also be noted that at the time the ordinary course of the bank's business was to conduct an orderly run-down of the bank. As such, IBRC's efforts, as a secured lender, to maximise the recovery on its loans to Siteserv was considered to be in the ordinary course of business. For that reason, and under the relationship framework in place at that time, IBRC was not required to consult the Minister for Finance on this matter in advance of making the decision to approve the sale of Siteserv. Upon receipt of critical representations following the transaction, Department of Finance officials inquired about the transaction with IBRC management as part of their regular engagement. Following initial discussions, they agreed with IBRC's chairman and CEO, on 31 May 2012, that they would review the transaction involving Siteserv in greater detail to better understand the decisions taken and the impact these decisions had on the process and the final recovery for the bank. Through this review, which took place on 11 June 2012, Department of Finance officials were concerned that IBRC had decided to allow Siteserv to control the sales process rather than itself acting in a primary role in this transaction. This decision appears to have given rise to a number of other subsequent actions which could quite reasonably be considered to have caused a reduction in the bank's recovery on the Siteserv exposure. These included the exclusion of potential trade buyers from the sales process, the fact that legal advisors to Siteserv also acted for the purchaser, and the making of a payment to the shareholders of Siteserv. In light of these concerns, the shareholding management unit of the Department of Finance recommended that the chairman of IBRC commission an independent review of the transaction, and this was included in a briefing note to the Minister for Finance prior to his meeting the chairman and CEO of IBRC. On 25 July 2012, the Minister for Finance met IBRC's chairman and CEO to discuss concerns regarding this transaction which were raised with him by Department of Finance officials following their engagement with IBRC management. The chairman and CEO gave strong assurances that the transaction had been thoroughly assessed by the IBRC board and that the management and board of IBRC were satisfied that the transaction was managed in the best manner possible to achieve the best result for the State, including the decision to allow Siteserv to control the sales process. At this meeting, the chairman and CEO further confirmed and provided assurances, with regard to the specific concerns previously mentioned, that trade buyers had been excluded due to the potential damage to Siteserv's competitive position that might otherwise have arisen; that the legal advice was provided by two different teams within the law firm concerned, and appropriate Chinese walls were in place between the two teams; and that the payment to shareholders was necessary to ensure a vote in favour of the deal. To help prevent such concerns regarding the quality of decisions taken by IBRC management from arising in the future, the Minister for Finance requested that a further meeting take place between the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, and the then CEO of IBRC. A meeting took place in August 2012 at which this matter was further discussed. At that point, and at all other points mentioned above, the transaction had been concluded and no further action could have been taken. Notwithstanding the fact that a revised relationship framework and operational protocol had been put in place on 29 March 2012, it was decided following John Moran's meeting with the then CEO of IBRC in August 2012 that a senior Department of Finance official would be seconded to IBRC to explore opportunities for deleveraging with a view to maximising the recovery for the taxpayer. This had the additional benefit of supporting the management team while also providing greater oversight, given that a number of matters within IBRC at that time raised concerns with Department of Finance officials. The secondment of Neil Ryan to IBRC commenced shortly thereafter, in October 2012, and he took up his role as the bank's new head of market solutions.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	318	The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, went out of his way on the night IBRC was wound down to compliment the board of IBRC. He stated, "I wish to emphasise that the reasons the steps are being taken are entirely distinct from the performance or the direction of the board of management of IBRC." He also stated: "I acknowledge, with much appreciation, the significant efforts the directors and staff have made". This is at odds with some of what I have received under the freedom of information provisions, including an internal memo from the Department which states that it was concerned at the number of very large transactions of over €100 million that were poorly executed under the direction of the then CEO, Mike Aynsley. The memo also states that the performance management in executing these transactions raised the question of the effectiveness of the CEO. Much of what the Minister of State said I could probably have written myself because of the information I have received through parliamentary questions, which was like pulling hen's teeth, but a whole lot of other questions need to be answered. There were many other very large transactions and we need to know what they were. The people whom the Minister of State and I meet every day, who are struggling and who bailed out the bank, have an entitlement to know they got as much as was possible. It seems that a golden circle is operating and that there are serious conflicts of interest all over the place. I would go so far as to say I believe there needs to be an independent inquiry into this transaction. If it is the case that a company, by virtue of winning that deal, was positioned to go on and win lucrative deals such as a metering contract, as was in the news, to the exclusion of other people who were trade buyers, one must ask why this could have happened. There are very serious questions which undermine democracy, and transparency needs to be the winner in this. I compliment the officials in the Department because from a lot of this I can see that they were really doing their job.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	319	Every action taken by the Government and the Minister for Finance has been taken with the aim outlined by Deputy Murphy: to minimise the cost of bailing out the bank to the Irish taxpayer and to restore our banking sector to a functioning reality so it can continue to serve the Irish economy. We may disagree on this, but it is the reason for the efforts undertaken by officials in the Department of Finance, whom the Deputy has rightly complimented, and by the Minister for Finance. I have already outlined how the Minister, once these concerns were brought to his attention - after the transaction had been completed, under a relationship framework put in place by the previous Government which did not require him to be consulted - took a number of steps, including meeting the chairman and the CEO, asking the then Secretary General to meet them and seconding Mr. Neil Ryan to IBRC from the Department of Finance. As part of Ireland's third review under the EU-IMF programme of financial support, a report on which was published in September 2011, Ireland committed to a number of conditions and actions. One of these was to develop a framework to govern the exercise of the State's ownership rights in the banks resulting from the capital injections, including to put in place relationship frameworks with the banks to protect the commercial basis for the banks' operations while under State ownership. The end of March 2012 was the deadline put in place for the introduction of these relationship frameworks with each of the banks in which the State acquired an interest in the context of the financial crisis, to govern the relationship between the State, as shareholder, and each bank. The relationship frameworks were designed to recognise the separation of each bank from the State, to ensure their businesses would be run on a commercial, cost-effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State, and to limit the State's intervention to the extent necessary to protect the public interest. New frameworks were put in place, and the revised relationship framework introduced with IBRC was considerably more intrusive than those with the other banks, and rightly so, as this was necessary given the increased level of oversight required in view of the unique position of IBRC as a run-down vehicle financially supported by the State through the promissory notes, and the Department of Finance's experience to date with IBRC at that time. The Deputy knows and has heard it from the Government that the ultimate decision to liquidate IBRC was taken in the context of the overall cost to the State of its orderly wind-down, which was being supported by the promissory notes at a heavy cost to the State. What concerns existed about certain management decisions are documented by the Department of Finance, and I have acknowledged them. Ultimately, the aim of minimising the cost of the orderly wind-down of IBRC was of primary concern to the Government. While it is not possible for any of us to express definitive views in the House on commercial decisions taken by boards of banks, it is possible to clearly set out the facts. I have set out the facts very clearly-----

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	322	I thank the Ceann Comhairle sincerely for allowing me to raise this Topical Issue. Along with my colleagues, I attended a public meeting on Friday night in my home town of Castledermot. It was called to discuss an issue that has caused many a sleepless night for the residents of three townlands close to the town, Madges Lane, Davidstown and Ballybannon: a repossession order granted from the High Court in regard to farmlands adjacent to the stated areas. The High Court decision is not part of the Topical Issue. However, I have grave concerns in regard to the actions that resulted from the decision and, in particular, the efforts of the receiver to repossess the property. Last week, upwards of 30 men, dressed in black, sought to access the property in the hours of darkness. Rural Ireland has suffered a lot from burglaries, theft, anti-social behaviour, etc., over the past number of years, to the point that communities have united to protect their properties and communities. One need only travel to practically any part of the country to see the great work and actions that those communities are involved in to give a sense of protection to themselves and their loved ones. I know from personal experience the great work that community texting does in my own community. In this context, one cannot but have concerns in regard to the actions outlined, with upwards of 30 men dressed in black, some with dogs and some wearing balaclavas, arriving at a rural location in the middle of the night. Can we explain this arrival in a rural area in the middle of the night? It is inexplicable that this was allowed to happen. It cannot be right, and we cannot but imagine the torment of those living in this rural location, many of whom are elderly. One woman of 75 years of age says she has not gone outside her door since. What is the procedure in regard to such actions? Is the Garda Síochána informed or asked to attend? Has the Garda Síochána the authority to say to the receiver that he or she cannot attend because of the hour of the night? Can the Minister of State please inform us whether, through the legislative process, we can ensure that actions as a result of such High Court decisions can take place only between dawn and dusk? We do not want to see it happen in our community or any other.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	323	I thank the Minister of State for being in attendance to discuss this issue. There always have been and, unfortunately, always will be repossessions of houses, land and property, and it is a dreadful vista for any individual or family, but it happens only at the end of a lengthy process. It is a dreadful experience for others living nearby. Leaving aside the rights or wrongs of individual repossession cases, I am concerned about the protocols or guidelines for dealing with such issues. Last week, an ongoing case in south Kildare came to a head when receivers acting on a court order attempted to take possession of land at three o'clock in the morning. It is reported that men wearing hoods with dogs were there. Neighbours stated that land was trespassed on and great intimidation took place as the situation escalated. I do not know if those in the hoods with dogs were the receivers or the protestors, but the activity took place in the middle of the night, and land belonging to third parties, who had no truck with what was going on, was crossed. Elderly people living alone were subjected to the sight of these strangers going around the area. My concern in this instance is primarily for neighbouring residents and landowners who have no involvement with either the receivers or the landowner against whom the order was made. This was always likely to be a flashpoint, because protestors were present and receivers were moving in. In the event that a receiver is in possession of a court order, the only role of the Garda Síochána is to keep the peace, but surely the view of the Garda Síochána should have to be taken on board by the receiver if it decides on a course of action. What guidelines or protocols, other than those to do with keeping the peace, exist for the Garda Síochána to ensure that those innocent people who live nearby are not put at risk and that their property is not interfered with? Does the Garda Síochána have any say or role if receivers decide to move on a property in the middle of the night? What protocols exist for receivers? If the court order does not stipulate how the order is to be enforced, is there a limit to the level of force that can be used? If the only role of the Garda Síochána is to keep the peace, and gardaí cannot stop receivers acting at certain times in a certain manner that may inflame a situation, we are asking the Garda Síochána to play referee between two factions with their hands tied behind their back. This is a dreadful situation. We must learn from it and ensure such events do not happen in Castledermot or elsewhere.

I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who regrets she is unable to be present for the debate due to other official commitments. I will bring the views of the Deputies to her attention. Without wanting to comment on the specific circumstances of any particular case, the Minister is very much aware of the strain that can arise for individuals and their families when their personal or business finances become distressed. In these circumstances, repossession of a home or other property inevitably brings those pressures to a head. As public representatives, we have all engaged with people struggling in these circumstances, and it is undoubtedly one of the most tangible legacies of the national economic mismanagement which this Government has been grappling with. This Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears and family home repossessions. This included an extensive suite of interventions designed to address the problem, including specific Central Bank targets for the banks through the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART. In addition, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears produced by the Central Bank sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in, or facing, mortgage arrears. We have also seen the extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation, including the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the introduction of the personal insolvency agreement model. In addition, we have enhanced the provision of advice through initiatives led by Department of Social Protection. Furthermore, the mortgage to rent scheme has been put in place to assist borrowers who are in an unsustainable mortgage position in remaining in their homes through the involvement of social housing agencies. I call attention to the review of the insolvency legislation announced as part of the statement of Government priorities. This involved consultations with all the relevant stakeholders and has been completed by the Department of Justice and Equality. Work is currently under way across Government Departments to develop a comprehensive and effective response to help those trapped in unsustainable debt to arrive at sustainable solutions. That work is expected to conclude shortly, and the Government's action plan in this area will be announced. The Minister is conscious of the painful situations that have arisen for families and farm and business owners, a number of which have been raised specifically with her as Minister. As these cases are matters that have been, or are, before the courts, it would not be appropriate for her to comment on their specifics. In response to the issues raised by the Deputies concerning the need for Garda guidelines on repossessions, it is important to be clear about the role and functions of members of the Garda Síochána in these circumstances. The proceedings that give rise to repossessions are first and foremost civil proceedings in which the Garda Síochána is not a party. There may be situations in which the Garda Síochána becomes aware, or is notified, that a property is to be the subject of enforcement proceedings on foot of a court order. In those circumstances, it is an operational matter for Garda Síochána management to assess whether a Garda Síochána presence is advisable so as to prevent any risk of a breach of the peace. Preserving public order is an essential function of the Garda Síochána, whether in circumstances relating to repossession or otherwise. Where the Garda Síochána attends in those circumstances, it is equally important to be clear that it does not have a role in the repossession process itself, unless specific actions are directed by the court, and is not in a position to act as an arbiter in the proceedings. There may be confusion on this point in the public mind, but this is the legal position and the Garda Síochána is clear about this when present in such circumstances. Issues of difference or difficulty concerning the enforcement of the order are matters for the parties to resolve before the courts. Where a breach of the peace occurs, there are of course provisions in public order and other legislation that may apply. Similarly, where an individual has concerns that a criminal action may be have been committed by any person in the course of such proceedings, this is a matter that the Garda Síochána will investigate. Furthermore, if a person feels he or she has grounds for complaint about the actions of a member of An Garda Síochána in this or any other matter, it can be pursued through a complaint to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. The Minister has no function with regard to persons appointed to execute court orders who are operating under the aegis of the courts. In conclusion, the Minister underlines that, as a matter of general Government policy, the effective management of the mortgage arrears challenges remains under continuous review. More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears. As the Taoiseach has previously announced, the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.

Such activity just leads to a risk of a flashpoint, which has a direct impact on innocent local communities. No personal landowner should be subjected to hooded men moving around their property with dogs in the dead of night in the name of our courts. We must ensure there are no repeat instances of what happened in Kildare last week. There must be very clear guidelines for the Garda, beyond keeping the peace. Keeping the peace is not enough of a role for our gardaí. In some ways we are asking them to referee a situation with one hand tied behind their back. Clear protocols must be put in place for receivers as to how they carry out their orders.

If our courts are just issuing orders with no description of how the order is to be carried out, we are allowing receivers or private security firms to act with impunity with the full weight of a High Court order behind them. They can say they can do what they like because they have a High Court order. Perhaps we need our judicial system to be more prescriptive about how the orders are carried out. The situation of people carrying on in the middle of the night, terrorising the whole community - people who have no part in the issue - is not acceptable and cannot continue.

They have outlined to me a situation in which 30 or more individuals dressed in dark clothing moved across a rural community in the dead of night. This appears to be an unacceptable situation, to say the very least. The Deputies' points are well made. They are very reasonable. Such a scenario, if it were to be repeated, would naturally cause concern, not just in that community but also in other communities. People need to know where the law lies in this regard. I will make a personal commitment to the Deputies to pass on the seriousness of the Deputies' feelings on this matter, to outline the circumstances they have described and to ensure the Minister responds to them in due course.

(12) A member of the Authority shall, unless he or she sooner dies, becomes disqualified, resigns, is removed from office or otherwise ceases to be a member, hold office as such member until the expiry of his or her term of office.(13) Each member of the Authority shall—(a) hold office on a part-time basis and on such other terms (other than payment of remuneration and allowances for expenses) as the Public Appointments Commission shall determine, and(b) be paid by the Authority, out of the resources at its disposal, such remuneration (if any) and allowances for expenses (if any) as the Authority may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, determine.(14) The Oireachtas may, for stated reasons, remove a member of the Authority from office if, in the opinion of the Oireachtas—(a) the member has become incapable through ill health of effectively performing the functions of his office,(b) the member has committed stated misbehaviour, or(c) the member has a conflict of interest of such significance that, in the opinion of the Oireachtas, he or she should cease to hold office.(15) A person shall be disqualified from holding and shall cease to hold office as a member of the Authority if he or she—(a) is adjudged bankrupt,(b) is convicted on indictment of an offence, excluding former political prisoners including those who qualified for release under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement,(c) is convicted of an offence involving dishonesty,(d) is struck off the roll of solicitors or practising barristers or, following a complaint against him or her, is found guilty of misconduct,(e) has a declaration under section 150 of the Companies Act 1990 made against him or her or is subject or is deemed to be subject to a disqualification order by virtue of Part VII of that Act, or(f) ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State.(16) Where a member of the Authority dies, becomes disqualified from holding office, resigns, is removed from office or otherwise ceases to be a member, the Government shall appoint a member to fill the resultant vacancy and in filling such vacancy shall appoint a person nominated by the person or body that nominated the person occasioning the vacancy.(17) A person who is appointed to be a member of the Authority under subsection (16) shall hold office for the remainder of the term of office of the member occasioning the casual vacancy.(18) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Authority may act notwithstanding one or more vacancies in its membership.(19) In appointing members of the Authority regard shall be had to the objective to there being no fewer than 4 members who are men and no fewer than 4 members who are women.”.This revisits discussions we had on Committee Stage. This Bill has dragged on for a number of years and there has been extensive input from various stakeholders around the make-up of the new authority. The amendment reflects the perspective I have heard from key stakeholders. There is a range of experience, and there should be a balance of people from the legal fraternity and people from the lay fraternity who have relevant expertise and who could make a real contribution. In terms of a new dispensation and giving the new authority a clear, strong, independent footing from the beginning, but also having representation from the legal fraternity, this is a better proposition than that offered initially by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	361	I have considered the proposed Opposition amendments, Nos. 7 to 11, relating to the modalities of the appointment of the new legal services regulatory authority. I think the Deputy will agree that these amendments remain pretty much as put forward before. They do not give due recognition to the enhancements made by the Government to the legislation and to the committee discussion at which these concerns were outlined. The relevant enhancements made on Committee Stage met the core concerns about the appointment procedures of the new authority which were on the table at that time - namely, how authority members would now be nominated independently of the Government. Authority members will now be nominated independently of the Government, and we are also setting out their terms and maximum duration of office, including the modalities of resignation, removal and disqualification, and the filling of temporary vacancies.The election of a lay chair and the gender balance of the authority's overall membership have also been consolidated into the text, which has also been adjusted, for example, to take account of the destigmatisation of bankruptcy under the Government's insolvency reforms. The group of amendments being tabled does not adequately take into account the intervening developments of the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil, and they remain in essence as positioned by the Bar Council in its document of 12 March. Regarding the Opposition amendments, this is particularly the case for the duplicate amendments Nos. 7 and 8, which set out a series of similar criteria for the establishment and membership of the new legal services regulatory authority with some variations from what is provided for in the Bill under section 8. Having reviewed the intervening development of the Bill and the key qualitative improvements made regarding the appointments to the new legal services regulatory authority, I do not believe there are any fundamental disparities remaining in how the Bill deals with the issues concerned. The safeguards in the Bill, and those reflected in today's reiterated Opposition amendments, therefore, reflect a series of common concerns which have been met substantially under the Bill as it stands. The reconfiguration of section 8 of the Bill on Committee Stage put to rest the initial concerns raised upon the publication of the Bill about the independence of the authority from ministerial or Government interference. There will be no Government appointments, lay, legal or official, to the authority, which makes it more robustly independent in this regard than it would be, for example, under today's Opposition amendment No. 9, which would allow the Government to appoint the lay members. The authority, as a statutory regulator, would also be independent of the Judiciary in its appointment, as befits the fact that under the Bill's independent professional conduct regime, proceedings may come before the High Court which retain key functions regarding the termination of matters of professional conduct by legal practitioners. Taking into account the obvious virtues of independence of the Government and Judiciary, I do not see merit in amendments Nos. 9 and 10. Members of both Houses will welcome the fact that section 8 of the Bill provides that members of the authority shall be appointed only following the passing of a resolution approving such appointments by both the Dáil and the Seanad. This important model safeguard provision is consistent with the highest international standard. The proposed amendment No. 11 has been made redundant by the fact that the lay membership of the new regulatory authority is to be appointed by means of the external nominating bodies to which I have already referred. I have given consideration to the possible addition of further members to the new legal service regulatory authority, including in light of earlier discussions on Committee Stage. The authority is to be a regulator of the provision of legal services in the State by legal practitioners and, therefore, is not an entity of the social partnership model. The authority is to have a membership of 11 members with a lay majority. The six lay nominees will be drawn from the Citizens' Information Board - which everybody will welcome - the Higher Education Authority, the Competition Authority, the recently merged Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, whose title under section 8(4) will be updated in the Seanad, the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants and the Consumers' Association of Ireland. It is very important that consumers have representation on the legal regulatory authority. If I were to add even more lay members, and a further two legal representatives, we would move towards a much more administratively cumbersome body of approximately 15 people. The balance of interest between the legal profession and the consumers of legal services at the levels of the individual community and enterprise can be met and regulated effectively and most efficiently under the current configuration of 11 members. I do not intend to enlarge the membership of the authority beyond this, in order to ensure that it will be an efficient body that gets on with the job that has to be done and makes decisions. Great care has been taken in ensuring the concerns that have been expressed since the publication of the Bill about the independence of the new regulatory regime in its appointment and functions have been addressed. Only a slight difference of emphasis remains between the proposals being put forward today and the Bill's current provisions regarding this area of the Bill, and I hope, in light of the points I have made and the considerable enhancements, including in particular the very important point about independence, that the Deputies will withdraw amendments Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive. The first of the next group of amendments, tabled by Deputy Catherine Murphy, amendment No. 11a, seeks to preclude any person who is served with the Solicitor's Disciplinary Tribunal, the Barristers' Professional Conduct Tribunal or its appeals board from becoming a member of the authority. Similarly, amendment No. 49f seeks to preclude any barrister who has served on the Bar Council or any of its permanent or non-permanent committees from becoming a member of the committee being established under section 44 of the Bill to review complaints about inadequate services. Amendment No. 50a also seeks to preclude any barrister who has served on the Bar Council or a Bar Council committee, the Barristers' Professional Conduct Tribunal or the Barristers' Professional Conduct Appeals Board from eligibility for the chairmanship of the new legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal, as set out under the terms of section 63 of the Bill. While I can see that the amendments seek to put maximum distance between the workings of the Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal and Bar Council and those of the new regulatory entities concerned, they would, by the same token, be likely to exclude many people with relevant experience. This is by virtue of the fact that the amendments, if implemented, would exclude a very large number of barristers and solicitors from participating in the capacities concerned, including some who would have relevant experience in the types of complaint and disciplinary procedure involved. Over the years, a large number of legal practitioners would have held office or served on such tribunals or committees, and it remains desirable that they could be drawn from to enable the new regulatory architecture to function effectively. This is acceptable. Under section 63 of the Bill, the chair of the legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal may, under the specific criteria set out, be a lawyer or a non-lawyer. The chair, whether a lay person, a solicitor or a barrister, will be appointed by the President of the High Court for a five-year term, once renewable, from the list of persons nominated by the Minister for membership of the tribunal. In light of these safeguards already in place and the very practical considerations that clearly arise regarding the availability of suitable candidates for membership of the committee and the position of chair of the disciplinary tribunal, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 11a, 49f or 50a. I hope my detailed explanation, particularly regarding the first set of amendments, illustrates that we have taken on board and dealt with the concerns that were expressed on Committee Stage.

If she is arguing that ICTU and IBEC do not need to be there because it is not a social partnership model, why would she exclude organisations such as the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and the Northside Community Law Centre, which are not-for-profit organisations that are advocates? Why not widen the participation of those organisations? While I welcome the inclusion of IHREC, there is a deficit. Given that the Bill will also go before the Seanad, the Minister could consider widening the board to 13 and making provision for a number of those advocacy groups. If the Minister cannot accept the amendment here and how, I ask her to reflect on it. Although the Legal Aid Board is included, the omission of FLAC and ICCL is serious. I ask the Minister to reconsider it.

Anybody would accept that the bodies on it represent a very broad range of groups and concerns. Obviously, it is important that the legal profession is represented, as well as consumers and those with specialist knowledge. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission brings a wealth of experience to the board in respect of citizens' rights and basic equality. I have explained in considerable detail why we have taken this direction with regard to representation and I believe that, as currently constituted, the balance of interests is well represented on the regulatory authority. It is not exclusive and does not exclude any particular perspective. It brings a broad range of perspectives to bear on decision making. Ultimately, we wish to have an authority that works effectively and efficiently and that has the numbers that will lead to good decision making. I am satisfied that the current approach achieves that.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	364	One of the issues this Bill was supposed to deal with - in which it has not succeeded, although amendments have been made - was the cost of accessing justice for citizens. One of the challenges for the legal fraternity in terms of its reputation is to look increasingly at its role as an advocate for citizens in terms of their rights and to ensure there is affordable access to the legal system and a change in how we conduct law in this country from the archaic, very expensive and, arguably, elitist judicial system, as some people perceive it. I have much admiration for people in the legal fraternity, but there are perceptions, which are sometimes the reality, about how the system has worked. It is a serious omission. The Minister could easily increase the number on the board to 13, an argument I made to the Minister's predecessor, and provide a place at the table for organisations such as the Free Legal Advice Centres, which are strongly respected, the ICCL and other groups that are champions or advocates for the citizen and that challenge all of us in terms of how the administration of justice works. Having people of that calibre on the authority could only strengthen it. They would be alternative voices. I ask the Minister to consider seriously the error of not including them on this board for the sake of two extra places. The Minister argues that ICTU and IBEC need not be on the authority because it is not a social partnership model, and I reluctantly accept that point. However, I do not understand why she cannot include the advocacy organisations that are so respected in the community and that could bring a dynamic to the authority that does not exist based on the current membership.

It seeks to ensure no member of the authority will have a conflict of interest arising from the administration of the tribunals. It is hard to conceive of how an authority could realistically exercise its statutory functions if members of the board had intimate knowledge of prior cases. I ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter.

It is about bringing another level of fairness and trust into the proceedings of the authority. Part of the reason for the amendment is to ensure members of a disciplinary tribunal which reviews disciplinary determinations are not conflicted by having been involved in disciplinary matters prior to the enactment of the legislation. I do not think the proposals are unfair. If the Minister were to consider the amendment and to allow me a conversation about it I would not press it.

In many ways, that is not very fair. In particular, the Bill will force non-Law Library barristers to be individually liable for paying levies under section 79 and they will be disbarred if they default. It is important to be clear that membership of the Bar Council as a professional body should be distinguished from that of the Law Library. We are giving both voluntary private organisations significant statutory functions under this Bill. Amendment No. 30a intends to draw attention to that and to ensure there is a fair arrangement for people who are not members of the Bar Council.

It is good that we can bring small business to the fore of parliamentary business. While we have an excellent committee, previously chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy English, and currently chaired by Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, which addresses many of these issues, that work, because it takes places downstairs in the committee rooms, goes unnoticed. The role of SMEs deserves more than that. As a country, we place great value on and attention to foreign direct investment. We have a fantastic track record in this regard and are world beaters in terms of the work which the IDA does in attracting foreign direct investment to this country, for which it is to be commended. We need to pay the same attention and make the same fuss of the 350,000 people in this country who are employed in and operate SMEs. We need to pay the same attention and make the same fuss of the men and women of this country who on a Monday morning may not know from where they will get the money to pay the salaries of their employees at the end of the week, never mind themselves. We need to pay the same attention and make the same fuss of self-employed businesspeople who make up a large cohort of the percentage of people in this country who are on low incomes. This is the want and the lot of many SME owners. They are left on their own without support, back-up or guidance. There is a fractured system of support across the country which is, at least in some places, excellent and in others dreadful. The lack of consistency in this regard is choking many businesses and not providing them with opportunities. Tonight, we are laying down some specific proposals in regard to securing a future for SMEs. There are many other issues we could mention in this motion but we have decided to focus on taxation and PRSI changes and access to finance. Many colleagues will discuss other issues around that. Many of us in this House will have had the experience in the last number of years of being approached by people who during the so-called boom times employed large numbers of people, but when their business went under as a direct result of the collapse in the economy were abandoned by the system while the people they had employed were given every support possible, including retraining, social protection assistance and so on. They were abandoned by a system that put a value on assets that were no longer of value, that could not understand, appreciate or be flexible enough to deal with business failure and could not understand or appreciate the personal impact this had on the individual or the desire of many of those individuals to restart their businesses. This is not a political charge; it is a system charge. We have a system that does not know what it means to understand the urgency of small business or the urgency of decision-making around small business. It is a system that thrives on regulation and paper, leaving small businesses choked by paper and rules, and not for the want of going to a lower base or lower common denominator but because we love gold plated regulation in this country. We need to set ourselves a firm ambition. I am very critical of the Government amendment which contains broad objectives that anybody would sign up to. They are of the Andrex puppy type in that they are nice and fluffy and everybody loves them but there is nothing specific to actually measure them against. The Fianna Fáil motion is quite specific and focused. The Taoiseach's statement that he wants Ireland to be the best small country in the world in which to do business by 2016 is also vague. We want Ireland to be the best country in which to be a small business. We want specifically to put small business at the forefront of enterprise policy. The proposals we make tonight are not, as suggested earlier by the troops in the Fine Gael press office, a reaction to demand for policy. They have been in the pipeline for some time, including as set out previously by Deputy Michael McGrath's proposals around the disparity in tax treatment, including capital gains tax, included in budget submissions in October 2013 and 2014. Deputy O'Dea will speak about his PRSI benefits policy, which has been in existence since 2012. The Minister of State will be aware that at the time of the launch of the credit guarantee scheme I articulated the Fianna Fáil view that it was too expensive and would not work. We were proven correct. We were promised that there would be a review and that legislation to amend the credit guarantee scheme would be introduced in the Autumn session last year. We were then told it would be introduced this Spring session. We are now in the Summer session and there is still no sign of the credit guarantee review legislation. All the time, that specific legislation is needed. It is needed, as stated last week during a Topical Issue debate, by businesses whose loans are being sold from under them by, in particular, Ulster Bank. These businesses need the protection of the credit guarantee scheme to refinance their loans. The legislation is required urgently. People's livelihoods are being sold from under them while the system tries to redesign a system that is broken. Despite that people's livelihoods are on the line two and a half years later we are still talking about a scheme which everybody knew from the start was flawed and would not meet its ambition. I acknowledge the changes made to the microfinance scheme and the turnaround that has occurred in that regard over the past year. Those involved have brought a sense of vibrancy and urgency to the situation but the whole area of credit finance remains unresolved. We are still not giving SMEs the kind of finance they deserve. The banks continue to publish statistics that indicate they are refinancing. Despite that they are being given more money through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland for so-called new business, they continue to call in loans and to refinance them and then declare this as new lending. They are continuing to put extra charges on people and small businesses and to tell small business on what day they can do their business. There are banks in this country that are dictating on what day businesses can lodge coin, leaving many businesses having to retain cash on their premises, which is not good. There are banks which are pulling away wholesale from rural areas, thereby forcing businesses in those areas to travel long distances to lodge cash. That is not something we want to see but it is what is happening. This is the reality for small business in terms of banking, which is not good enough. Earlier, we spoke about variable interest rates for mortgage holders. Variable interest rates in regard to business lending are off the scale. There is no sense of competition in the market. Two years ago, the decision was made to establish a strategic banking corporation that would focus on small business, in the same way as the ICC and ACC did in the good old days. The Government opted instead to use the money that became available to it to invest in the existing pillar banks, leading to no competition or hunger between them for business and no sense of new products or new service to a business community that is crying out for that type of service and is required to give that type of service to its customers. We long-finger the banking problems as well. The Government amendment praises the local enterprise offices, some of which I acknowledge are working very well, including the economic investment unit in Mayo. I acknowledge the fantastic work done by that unit in delivering the transatlantic cable project, which will be hugely important not alone for Mayo but for the entire country.However, the LEOs are the county enterprise boards, CEBs, re-branded. In terms of service, there has not been a significant change from what was provided by the county enterprise boards, which served people fairly well. With regard to training, the majority of the CEBs served us well. What the LEOs need is new fire power. They need the ability to give small loans, more than what is being given at present. The LEOs need to expand their role in the context of a 21st-century economy as opposed to a 19th-century economy, as this is the thinking behind much of the legislation underpinning the LEOs, which is undermining them. They needed a complete change of thought as well as change of name, and they need to be out there. They need to be down and dirty, to understand where small businesses are at, and to be more urgent and responsive on a consistent basis. In terms of service, it should not matter whether a business is on one side of a county border or the other. These are persons putting their lives on the line to create opportunities for themselves and others, and they are entitled to the best possible service regardless of their geography, but that is not the way at present. The notion that the Government can continue to lean on the LEOs and put them up there as a great creation when all they are is a new name on a successful body has to change. The LEOs have to change as well. They have to be more hungry and more consistent in the services that they deliver. Later, Deputy Michael McGrath will speak about the disparity in tax treatment. Deputy O'Dea has proposed increased PRSI benefits for the self-employed. He proposed a scheme under which the self-employed would be encouraged to pay into a fund, which would be there in the event of a business going under to support the self-employed while they retrain, re-imagine and re-launch themselves. That is a culture we need in this country. We need to believe in business people and we need to believe in business as a career opportunity. There are 65,000 students preparing to do the leaving certificate examination, and we want them to think of setting up a business in the same way they think of the professions or the trades, or the same way they think of going off to college for a few years. We want them to be comfortable in thinking that if it goes wrong and if, for whatever reason, the business does not work out, they will get back on the horse and start again, because that is the culture we need. As a country, as I have stated consistently, we love to celebrate failure. We love to see things not working out for somebody. We need to change that attitude. Instead of celebrating failure, we should acknowledge failure as part of the learning process in life. It makes one do something different. It makes one do it better on the next occasion. If we encourage such a culture, it is the kind of culture that will foster business. On that basis, I wish everybody involved in the Student Enterprise Awards tomorrow every success. Those are the kinds of event, at transition year level and at college level, that are beginning to take hold around the country. Every student should have some understanding of business. Instead of isolating business studies at leaving certificate level, we need to make it a core subject to which students get exposure. Anybody taking up an apprenticeship or trade should be given business experience and business education so as to be equipped with the essentials that are needed. Members, who are all in the same boat in their offices, meet many people looking for supports and backup. People repeatedly go looking for that support and cannot find it. Previously, I proposed to the Taoiseach - he undertook to pursue it, but that has not happened - that the best business database in this country is that of the Revenue Commissioners. One is hardly set up in business before the Revenue Commissioners are in touch. They would have the ability, if there was cohesion, organisation and interest in Deputy English's Department, to send to every business in this country a few times a year notice of the supports and grants available. Frankly, business people are too busy trying to keep their heads above water to go looking for that. If the Revenue Commissioners can send them every kind of correspondence going within weeks of their establishment, surely it can try to give them help as well. If there is to be one initiative that comes out of this debate, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, that this be it. The other bodies that know more about business than businesses do are the local authorities. For local authorities, businesses are ATMs that they keep going to and that they keep trying to get cash out of. Eventually, for many businesses, the ATM says "No," because they cannot keep giving. Previously, I have told the story of a successful start-up employing ten people in the services sector in one county, which opened a branch in another county employing five people. This involved significant up-front investment on the part of the business owner. The first letter they got from the relevant local authority was not one welcoming the business to the county, thanking it for choosing that county to set up the business and stating the supports available. It was a demand for €6,500 in rates, a demand for water charges and a demand for parking levies that had not been paid. That was the welcome that was given. The attitude of many local authorities to business is that they are a cash cow or an ATM. They do not see businesses as customers. They do not see business as a partner in the development of their counties. That, too, has to change. All in all, we have a system that does not understand business in 2015 and does not understand SMEs in 2015. It does not understand what it is like on a Friday evening after one has done a week's work, or a Saturday evening or a Sunday evening if one is working seven days. It does not understand what it is like not to have enough money to pay one's self after paying everybody else. A business owner might have paid the Revenue Commissioners, the local authority and the staff, and is then left without anything. Until that system is forced to change, we will continue to treat business as some sort of pet - something to be stroked, patted on the head every day and told, "You are a good boy. Sit, boy. Stand still, boy," while we do nothing to give them a hand and allow them to use their teeth. Let us get some ideas over the next two nights but, more importantly, let us do something about it.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	393	I very much welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate, and I commend my colleague Deputy Calleary on his introduction of this motion on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party. The motion is a continuation of a theme that my party has been pursuing over quite a long period. It is quite practical in nature. In my view, it is the type of motion that Opposition parties should be putting forward. It deals with many of the key issues that are affecting the self-employed and small business owners in this country every day. It deals with taxation, PRSI and access to social protection benefits, lending, and the tax environment for entrepreneurs in terms of capital gains tax relief. I will refer to some of those in more detail in a moment. This motion from Fianna Fáil is designed to support those who are currently self-employed and those who currently own small businesses, and, equally importantly for the future of the country and for our economic development, those who wish to become entrepreneurs and small business owners. Not enough time is spent in this House debating these fundamental issues. When it comes to foreign direct investment, as Deputy Calleary stated, Ireland is a strong performer indeed. No country can match our track record in attracting and retaining foreign direct investment, FDI. We are the envy of our European partners in this regard. Successive Governments have played their role in ensuring that the FDI environment in Ireland is strong, not least with the commitment to the 12.5% corporation tax rate. We have a critical advantage in being the only English-speaking country in the eurozone while providing access to a large European market. Of course, our historic relations with the United States do not do us any harm either. However, there is a paradox at the heart of economic policy in the State. While we make every effort to support the endeavours of multinationals to establish themselves and thrive in Ireland, it would seem we are far less concerned as a nation about supporting the self-employed and domestic SMEs, which, after all, employ the majority of those working in this country. They should be given far more practical support in terms of the day-to-day challenges that they face. There is no shortage of Irish people with good ideas for products and services that consumers would be willing to buy, but too often the obstacles in their way prove too great. Setting up a business in Ireland is a daunting undertaking as it involves having to negotiate a minefield of regulatory and financial hurdles. As a nation, we need to change our attitude towards those in business and take radical steps to encourage and support new startups. In the motion, my party outlines a number of practical measures which we believe would make a real difference to the self-employed and the SME sector in terms of the economic life of this country. By contrast, the amendment that has been put forward by the Government is deeply disappointing and self-congratulatory in tone, and contains no specifics whatsoever.The Government has been leaking furiously in respect of changes to the taxation regime for the self-employed. Yet, when the matter was put to the Government by way of a motion in the Dáil tonight, it did not even acknowledged the issue. The Government is not acknowledging the fact that self-employed people are being treated in a fundamentally different way in terms of their income tax arrangements. This is disappointing to say the least. It is easy to leak a line to a national newspaper, which will take it gladly and publish it, but there is an opportunity on the floor of the Parliament tonight to show that this is a priority for the Government. Certainly, that has not been shown in the amendment, although perhaps the Minister of State will illustrate it in his speech later tonight. As we know, the PAYE tax credit of €1,650 per annum is available to all employees but not to the self-employed or proprietary directors. The primary reason the PAYE tax credit was introduced and limited to employees was to take account of the fact that, at the time, the self-employed generally had the advantage of paying tax on a prior year basis. This meant they had a significant timing advantage, particularly in times of high inflation. However, this logic is no longer relevant because payment dates have changed significantly since the credit was first introduced. Now preliminary tax, which is typically 90% of the final tax liability, is paid in the current year. This eliminates the timing advantage and requires some tax to be paid in part on profits that have not yet been earned. It is our strong view that in so far as possible the tax system should treat people in an equitable manner. Self-employed people lose under the current regime because while they receive the personal tax credit they cannot claim an equivalent of the PAYE tax credit, which is €1,650. This has a particularly stark impact at lower levels of income. As noted on publicpolicy.ie, budget 2015 worsened the relative position of low-income self-employed persons. The website has stated that a self-employed single person on an income of €15,000 now pays almost eight times more tax and PRSI than an employee on the same income and has a lower entitlement to social welfare benefits. Let us consider the signal we, as a country, are sending out to the self-employed and to young people who may be looking at the option of becoming self-employed or starting up their own businesses. The fact is the taxation system discriminates negatively against them. I acknowledge this has been the case over a period of successive Governments. Now is the time to say that it is not fair, that it must change and that it should be addressed as a priority. Fianna Fáil has outlined firm proposals in this regard today. We believe an equivalent tax credit should be made available to people who are self-employed on a phased basis. The overall cost of that would be €450 million per annum. We believe a reasonable start would be to provide a tax credit of €500 for the self-employed in year one. This would cost in the region of €140 million. Given that in last October's budget the Government gave an income tax package of well over €600 million, this is not unrealistic in any sense. A significant and tangible move could be made to extend that tax credit to the self-employed. I realise this will take time but we believe over the longer term the 3% surcharge on high-income self-employed persons should be phased out and ended. Ultimately, this would serve to equalise the application of the universal social charge to PAYE and self-employed persons. Again, I believe this is a question of the environment we create. There is nothing wrong with earning more than €100,000 in this country. Without doubt, when major austerity had to be introduced and tax had to be increased, people at the higher end had to shoulder more of the burden because they were earning the highest amount of income. That was only proper and fair. However, our objective as a country should be to treat the self-employed and PAYE workers on an equal basis. We should be working towards implementing that aim. I am keen to highlight the issue of capital gains tax and the treatment we apply to entrepreneurs who start up their own businesses. There is a limited convoluted and cumbersome relief on the Statute Book at the moment. Let us compare it to the simple system that operates in the United Kingdom, where a 10% capital gains tax rate applies to qualifying entrepreneurs. By comparison, Ireland is only in the halfpenny place in terms of attracting young people who want to start up a business. We should bear in mind that much of this type of investment in financial services, information technology and in the technology sector is highly mobile in nature. Ireland is no longer the destination of choice for someone who has an idea that develops into a high potential start-up company because of the punitive taxation system we have in place. The 33% rate for entrepreneurs is now a deterrent and a disincentive to people starting up their own business in Ireland. We believe this needs to be addressed. We have proposed for a long period and in several budget submissions made to the Department of Finance that a special 15% rate should apply to qualifying entrepreneurs who start up a business, develop it successfully and eventually sell it on. Many of them will reinvest in the economy. I am keen to highlight important legislation that our colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, is bringing to the Seanad tomorrow to ensure that Irish small and medium-sized enterprises compete on a level playing field with their European counterparts in successfully bidding for public procurement contracts that provide significant social benefits. Every year the State tenders for more than €8.5 billion worth of goods and services. However, Ireland, unlike many other European Union countries, focuses on the lowest tender price offered with no consideration for the social impact of certain tenders with a higher cost. In essence, there should be a system whereby the wider economic benefits of supporting Irish SMEs through the procurement system should be measured and dealt with by way of the procurement process in place. I could go on about several other issues but I know my colleagues have a number of important points to make as well. I commend Deputy Calleary on putting forward this motion. It is practical and solution-driven. I hope the Government takes note of this and, as it appears to be doing in respect of mortgages and other areas, elects to adopt ideas that Fianna Fáil is coming up with to solve key problems in the economy.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	394	I spent most of my life being self-employed before I was elected to this House in 1997. During the course of that time and my involvement in several businesses, which employed 30 people, there was little support for the SME sector. I consider myself to be very much part of the micro-section of that sector. Nothing much has changed. If anything, it has got worse. For example, I believe winding down the county enterprise boards and re-branding them as local enterprise offices as part of the county councils will prove to be a retrograde step. The county councils have no real knowledge of business or enterprise skills within their organisation to deal with this. By and large, the LEOs will be simply administrators dealing with what they call small businesses but what are really businesses within niche markets that do not touch the high street, the brand names on the high street or many other sectors that need support and help. The situation is likewise in respect of the general policy within the Department and as it filters down to Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland clients. I believe all enterprise policy, activity and the logistics in terms of trade missions should be centred in one Department, that is the Department with responsibility for enterprise. I do not see a role for the Department of Foreign affairs and Trade or for people who, generally speaking, have been trained in diplomacy but not in business promotion or accommodating business techniques abroad. This is an important market for us but one that requires skill, engagement and risk. I do not see anyone else with those ingredients except business people. The Department needs to learn a great deal more about how that business is done at home and abroad. The Government's amendment and what has been said in the House show that governments can change but the attitude of those who manage Departments that engage with enterprise does not. For example, the Government claims to recognises the improvement in the tax environment for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, there has been no improvement in the tax environment for SMEs. Government Members should ask retailers in the high street or small-business people in industrial estates about this.I am talking about family-owned businesses that are owned by individuals, businesses that have been there for generations. An awful lot of them have closed because of the lack of understanding of Governments in regard to tax issues that affect the SME sector. The Minister of State talks in his amendment about the new sources of finance that are being made available to the SME sector. I can tell him that despite the billions of euro that have been put by the Government into our banks, which was meant to be for small businesses, very little of that has gone towards the restructuring of loans or the support of the SME sector. Since 2008, businesses have spent every single cent they have earned in order to keep open or to pay for the loans they could qualify for. Some of them were hanging on out of sheer pride because the business might have been in the family for generations. The banks have failed to restructure loans that are perhaps not central to the core business and they have failed to give the opportunity to business people to perform. I have never seen as many businesses within the SME sector almost imprisoned by the banks and put into a state of limbo because they cannot transact or do business given the fact they do not have a supportive bank. At the same time, they cannot get out of their banking arrangements because that is the bank they have made the arrangements with, and no other financial institution will take them. They would have a good core business if only they were released to do that business. I suggest that the credit unions, which have some €7 billion in total, be asked to contribute in some way to the support of the SME sector. They are the only ones that truly understand what a business means to a community and how to support business. Whatever is needed from the Central Bank, the credit unions should be facilitated. There is a German public bank that is saying to us here in Ireland that this is the model we should follow. It was not affected at all by the downturn in the banking sector because of the way in which it managed its affairs. It supports businesses throughout Germany. That model works for it and it should be encouraged by the Central Bank and the Government to set up in Ireland in order to give an opportunity to those who have good business ideas to come forward, be funded and be successful. There was a time in this country when 1.2 million people were employed within the SME sector but that must have nearly halved by now. Many of our entrepreneurs have gone to other countries because the environment for doing business is not what it should be for the SME sector. The Minister of State spoke about the new focus on start-ups. There is no focus on start-ups. The LEOs have no idea how to support a start-up business. The businesses that are in business and have been successful over the years are finding it difficult to get the financial support, the expertise, the mentoring and, indeed, the tax environment that would assist them in passing their business from one generation to another. The Minister of State pointed to the success of the Pathways to Work strategy and he suggested other initiatives taken by the Government in this regard. It just has not worked. We do not see businesses taking on the number of people they need because there is no real financial incentive for them to do it. Vouchers could be used for mentoring or for many other aspects of buying in professional opinion for a business but that has not been embarked upon. Last but not least, the Minister of State said the Government resolves to continue to engage with SMEs. What do the SMEs ask for? When the Minister of State talks about microfinance, credit finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, it is alien to them. They are simply interested in a bank that understands business, that will facilitate them, that will give them loans and that will assist them out of their debt in terms of restructuring. It not that they will not pay but a question of accommodating them in order to pay. It needs a Government that understands governance. How can the Government fit the same straitjacket of governance on every single business? It just cannot be done because small businesses cannot carry the cost of that burden. What is the burden? It is when ten different Government agencies call to business premises on a very regular basis and go through paperwork in a way that treats business people like criminals and asks them to respond immediately or forthwith. That is not understanding from Government. In my opinion, that is bullying by the State agencies of small businesses that are attempting to the best of their ability to comply with over-regulation. Departments or bureaucrats can put out figures and say to the public that they have reduced costs by a value of €25 million. The Minister of State can ask any business in a high street or an industrial estate whether that is a fact and they will tell him it is not. A further point concerns procurement. If anyone wants to see how the Government really thinks about small businesses, just look at the procurement process. It is so out of reach of the SME sector that the SMEs cannot compete. The Government suggests they should collaborate with their opposition in business in order to get the contracts. What absolute nonsense that is. There is €9 billion at stake. I can tell the Minister of State that the small business people, particularly in the area of stationery or machinery supply to Government, are simply not satisfied with the moves the Government is making. I appeal to the Minister of State, by way of conclusion, to put to one side all the nonsense and gobbledygook that the bureaucrats give to him about what is happening to small businesses and to listen to the small business sector. I am going to launch a business document this week which covers every single aspect of business. I ask that it be examined in the context of real support for the small businesses that have made this country over the years.

The Government should welcome it because I have no doubt that, having assessed it, the Minister of State, Deputy English, will see that it is constructive and that it puts forward many real solutions to the problems experienced by self-employed people working throughout this country and by small and medium enterprises. It has been mentioned by previous speakers that we have done very well in terms of the international and IDA-led investment into Ireland over the decades. That is something which many countries would seek to emulate and copy from us. However, there is not the same thirst internationally to copy the model we have in regard to how we treat the self-employed and small and medium enterprises. That is because, unfortunately, too many burdens have been put by the Government on those who are self-employed and those running small and medium enterprises, and that burden has continued to increase year on year over recent times. Alongside that, as the recession developed and put many self-employed people and small businesses out of business, those people also came to realise there was no support in place for them. Many of these people had provided PAYE employment in the past. When they laid people off, they provided redundancy payments in many cases to people who were subsequently able to avail of the safety net of social welfare payments. However, those who were running these businesses and those who were self-employed found that they themselves were not able to avail of the safety net they expected to have from the State. There has been a culture shock where, as those who were unemployed assess their experience at the hands of the State, in many cases they are thinking twice about whether they should actually look to set up businesses again or go back into self-employment.That is a barrier to ensuring that the potential of many people is reached. Deputy Calleary has put forward a number of real and valid suggestions which the Minister of State should take into account. They include increasing PRSI benefits for the self-employed, improved access to credit for the SME sector, ending the disparity in the tax treatment between the self-employed and PAYE workers, an extension to the credit guarantee scheme and a capital gains tax environment that encourages start-ups. Each of these proposals is well thought out and will make a real difference if embraced by the Government. Much has been made of the proposals put forward and implemented in regard to the reform of county enterprise boards in their re-establishment as LEOs. Unfortunately, in too many cases, the reality has been that it has simply been a rebranding. Many businesses that need real support are not able to avail of it to the extent they require because the LEOs need to be better supported in terms of the resources they have to be able to engage with local businesses. Many people need ongoing mentoring. In many cases with proper investment and an increase in the grants available LEOs could make a real difference in terms of getting new businesses and enterprises off the ground. Another key factor, which was mentioned by Deputy McGuinness, is the level of regulation on small businesses, such as those involved in retail. The increased red tape and paperwork they have to deal with on an ongoing basis is excruciating.  We all get regular feedback from those starting one, two or three people enterprises that they are trying to stay as small as possible rather than grow because of the difficulties and complications increased employment can create for a small enterprise. It is something that should not be the case and needs to be addressed urgently to ensure the potential of the economy is realised. Areas outside of cities will depend on those who are self-employed in small and medium enterprises to grow. It is to be hoped an economic recovery will take root, something which has not yet happened largely because the supports that small and medium enterprises and the self-employed sector need are not in place.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss SMEs supports and the work and job creation in which they are involved. In that regard, while I might not agree with everything the Opposition said, I welcome the chance to discuss this. I am only sorry, as are my colleagues, that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, could not be here. They are both out of the country and the timing has not worked out; it is not anyone's fault. This is an important issue. Deputy Calleary mentioned the work the committee would do in this area. It must be recognised that great work goes on at the committee. It is cross-party and everyone, including spokespersons, does their bit to contribute to policy changes. When I was a member of the committee I wondered if anyone listened. I realised during my seven or eight months in the Department that people listen, have watched what we do and value our work. I have seen suggestions the committee brought forward over the past couple of years feed through to policy changes and initiatives, which is good to see. I hope during my time as Minister of State that we can do more of that and work more closely together. There is a recognition in the Department that the committee does great work. I welcome the atmosphere in the committee meetings, as a former Chairman and now as a Minister of State. We need it because businesses need us to work together and not fight over silly stuff. The majority of speeches have been constructive. I will not agree with all of the criticism, but there are some ideas on which we can work and others on which we are already working. If Deputy McGuinness brings forward a policy I will read it line by line. I am sure he and Deputy Calleary will work hard on it. If we can implement some changes or good ideas, we will do so. The Action Plan for Jobs is an open process to which every Deputy and person can contribute. Since coming into office this Government has had a clear focus on supporting enterprise in Ireland, particularly micro enterprises and SMEs which make up over 99% of businesses in the enterprise economy in Ireland and account for almost 70% of people employed. It is often missed that the majority of our businesses are SMEs. The Government's stated aim is the delivery of 100,000 new jobs by 2016. Recent CSO figures indicate that since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs in 2012 an extra 90,000 jobs have been created in net terms and we are well on our way to reaching 100,000 extra jobs during this year, a full 18 months ahead of schedule. All of us knew that was an ambitious target. Many said it could not be achieved, but it has been and shows the dedication of people in business in the private sector to job creation when they are encouraged and given policies with which they can work that make it easier to create sustainable, enterprise-driven jobs. This was the ambition we set ourselves because we were convinced that with the whole of Government working together, and in partnership with industry and workers, we could reverse the collapse that previous policy choices had created. We knew when we started out on the action plan process that the recovery would have to be export-led and that our success would be driven by our ability to compete on the international stage. Every region has seen its jobs numbers increase. Jobs that depend on the domestic sector, like construction and retail, are also now adding numbers. Exports from Enterprise Ireland assisted companies were at record levels in 2014.  The outcome of that conviction, and the policies that underscored it, is that in 2014 both IDA and Enterprise Ireland had record years. Combined, they created a net additional 15,000 jobs which, in turn, support a similar number in support services and related sectors. This is making a real impact all over the country. Notably, Enterprise Ireland, which looks after Irish-owned exporting companies, added over 8,000 of those new jobs. This means that Irish companies are right at the heart of our recovery, working side by side with our international colleagues.  However, the Government's strategy has also placed central importance on Ireland's locally trading businesses, as reflected in action plans in recent years. The most obvious manifestation of this was the launch in 2014 of the nationwide system of local enterprise offices, LEOs, which are embedded in local authorities. The establishment of LEOs means that all categories of business, including sole traders, micro businesses and small and medium sized companies, have access to Government supports and advice. Enterprise boards did great work in the past but were not allowed to work with all types of companies. Not everybody can get grant aid, but there are extra supports for companies that need them.  At the time it was said, and it was mentioned this evening, that it was wrong to put the LEO concept into place and that local authorities were not enterprise-facing but we are trying to change that. Local authorities and many other State bodies had to become enterprise-facing and develop an understanding of enterprise. We are making a difference because all of our Departments are part of the Action Plan for Jobs process. Every Department is getting a feel for jobs and what it is to be enterprise driven. Most important, local authorities are now working with that process. They have to lead the way, through LEOs and under the policy direction of Enterprise Ireland, to change the local environment and make it easier to create jobs. They are working on that and are achieving their goals, but the long-term results will be even better.  I see it in Meath, which has become very enterprise-facing and much more approachable for small, medium, large, international and local companies. I was in Limerick today and saw how city and county councils have become enterprise-facing and are working locally to drive real change and results. I was delighted by what I saw. That happened because there was a change in local structures. The enterprise boards have changed. I have said, and will say again, that there was an opportunity to improve local authorities, which is happening and is a positive change in terms of enterprise and creating jobs.  The restructuring means that people thinking of starting or expanding a business in any part of the country can access the full range of State supports provided by different Government bodies, for example, local authorities, Enterprise Ireland, Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, the Credit Review Office and training bodies, in one easily accessible location within the local authority. The annual results for LEOs, published just last week, show that at the end of 2014 total direct employment among the 6,058 LEO client companies stood at 31,326. The results also show that a total of 7,305 new jobs were created during 2014, in gross terms, and taking into account losses, a net increase of 4,012, or 14%, in the numbers of people at work in these enterprises. The policy changes are working and delivering.These results show that the new system is performing extremely well, with over 4,000 extra jobs in supported companies in 2014 and job growth in every county. The LEOs will continue to be a crucial part of our plans to deliver sustainable full employment and to accelerate job growth in every region of the country. The Action Plan for Jobs will again be the Government's main focus for delivering for the SME community, and it has the needs of small business at its core. The objectives and actions set out in the plan are designed to have specific impacts in terms of jobs, exports and start-ups, access to finance, market penetration, innovation, access to talent, and efficiency of public sector interaction with business. The Action Plan for Jobs is a whole-of-government initiative under which all Departments and agencies work together to deliver on the agreed action points for each year. The whole-of-government approach is key. Every Department has a role and over 60 agencies have to be involved and do their bit. In the past, that did not happen. As has been said here, many Departments did not really understand the needs of businesses and how difficult conditions can be. The majority of businesspeople do not get easy money and work very hard for what they get in order to survive. It is important that this message is received in every Department. Most Departments recognise that now and realise they must, where they can, make it easier for businesses to survive and thrive. Since the Action Plan for Jobs process was started in early 2012, almost 1,000 individual actions have been implemented by 16 Departments and dozens of State agencies to support job creation. In late January, the Government launched the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, the fourth annual plan in a multi-year process. It details 382 actions that will be taken by 16 Departments and over 60 State agencies that will support job creation. The process is about making it easier for enterprises to create jobs, grow, survive and scale up. This was not always possible because we were not really enterprise driven; we were thinking of construction and selling houses to one another. As the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has said on many occasions, we do not get rich as a nation by selling houses to one another but by exporting and trading with other nations. That is what we are trying to concentrate on and it is why we are seeing success. Some of the actions in the plan are quite simple and basic. Others are quite constructive and new but even the basics must be done. We recognised on entering office that the basics were not put in place to make it easy to start or run a company or small business. We are trying to make it easier as we go along. While there are more improvements to be made, the process is constantly evolving. New actions can be submitted by any Deputy. If they are worthwhile, we will take them on board. It does not matter who submits them. If they are good for business, they will fit into the plan. The Government is taking a range of further measures, including the development of regional action plans, to ensure economic recovery and job creation are spread right across the country and that all regions can achieve their potential. Among the headline measures to be delivered in 2015 through the Action Plan for Jobs are regional enterprise strategies, to be rolled out shortly across the country, including competitive funding initiatives worth up to €250 million, aimed at encouraging stakeholders in each region to co-operate and develop projects to support enterprise and job creation in their area. This is to encourage a regional approach. We can benefit by having counties working together. Another measure concerns entrepreneurship, with new measures to deliver on ambitious targets for job creation by start-ups, including a new SURE tax incentive to provide funding for people starting businesses and a start-up Gathering, to be held in Ireland during 2015. There is to be increased focus on job creation in the domestic economy, including measures to support the retail, construction and agriculture sectors. Awareness is important. There is a need to promote increased awareness among businesses of Government supports available to help them through a campaign centred around www.actionplanforjobs.ie and other initiatives. Deputy Calleary referred to using the Revenue Commissioners. I totally agree and have said the same myself. We are actually examining the proposal in the Department. One of the first meetings I was at as a Minister of State involved my bringing to the table what we had discussed at a committee meeting, namely, the concept of Revenue sending messages to businesses regularly. Every week we get a little message from the HSE, the message of the week. That is an approach we could use to get the message out. We are taking on board the use of Revenue and trying to determine how we could implement the proposal. The Deputy is correct that most people in business are swamped with information and are so busy trying to get the job done that they might miss the opportunity to avail of a support that might suit them. We have tried to target them. The Deputy’s idea has been talked about. It is good and is certainly one we will work on. This year's action plan continues to focus on competitiveness and places renewed emphasis on encouraging new start-ups and growing companies of scale. It also introduces new approaches to deliver on balanced regional development. One of the core ambitions for the Action Plan for Jobs is to stimulate the domestic economy and generate employment in the locally traded sector and to build an indigenous engine of growth that drives up the export market share of Irish companies. Whether operating in agrifood, retail, tourism or construction, these important firms will be supported over the next 12 months in a variety of ways, including direct investment, support to begin trading online, focus on attracting greater numbers of overseas visitors, and ongoing implementation of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. The National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship in Ireland was launched in October 2014 and is the culmination of work carried out since May 2013. The statement represents the first time a Government has published a comprehensive national strategy for entrepreneurship. It is an important strategy and it is important that the Government recognise it. I am glad it is being supported by all parties. The key target contained in the plan is to double the jobs impact of start-ups in Ireland over the next five years, from 93,000 currently. In order to deliver on this, we must increase the number of start-ups by 25%, representing 3,000 more per annum; increase the survival rate in the first five years by 25%, which will result in 1,800 more survivors per annum; and improve the capacity of start-ups to grow to scale by 25%. It is a question of starting, surviving and scaling up. That is what we are about in the plan and strategy. In Ireland, we have great entrepreneurs but, as the Minister has said, we just do not have enough of them. We all agree on that. There is an onus on us all to do what we can to increase the number and improve the culture that fosters entrepreneurship. Given that two thirds of all new jobs come from start-ups, it is crucial that we examine our policies across government to ensure they are aligned with our ambitions in this area. While some of the recommendations need input from the business sector, there is much that the Government can do to incentivise, support and promote, and to encourage more people to start businesses. That is what the policy statement will deliver. Tomorrow, we will attend the student enterprise awards and see more of the entrepreneurial culture. There are over 16,000 people involved. The initiative has been a feature for a number of years. It is a really positive development for the country and will certainly contribute to entrepreneurship in the future. This policy statement sets out the Government's strategic objectives as a facilitator within the Irish entrepreneurship ecosystem in key areas that impact on entrepreneurs and start-ups and it signposts the direction policy will take in the coming years. The Government has brought renewed focus to access to finance and, more recently, finance for growth for our scaling SMEs. The onset of the international financial crisis and the problems with our national banking system have created a tough financing environment for our SMEs. No one is denying that; we all recognise it. The culture has improved but we constantly want to improve further. The Government is aware that our SMEs have traditionally tended to be overly reliant on banks and bank loans. Through the annual Action Plan for Jobs process, we have driven a range of policy initiatives and new programmes to support SMEs accessing finance from both bank and non-bank sources. The enterprise committee has done a lot of work on that issue and has made some good suggestions that have been implemented to try to widen the range of non-bank sources. Over 90% of SMEs are dependent on traditional banking methods. That is not a balance we wish to continue with and we must rebalance as we go along. This annual process is supported by a cross-Government and agency SME State bodies group, which brings together all the relevant State officials who work together to deliver on this crucial agenda for our SMEs. The policy initiatives and new programmes include the establishment of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, providing up to €800 million in funds for SMEs; the development of an innovative tool for supporting SMEs online to provide an individual with details of and a contact point for all the possible Government business supports available; the launch in 2012 of the microenterprise loan fund, which is run by Microfinance Ireland; and, more important, the review of the microenterprise loan fund, with new changes to be launched in 2015, including the removal of the requirement for a bank refusal. Other initiatives include the launch of the credit guarantee scheme in 2012, with Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank as participating lenders; and the review of the credit guarantee scheme, with a new credit guarantee scheme 2015 to deal with refinancing where banks are exiting the Irish SME lending market and extending the maximum length of the guarantee from three to seven years. With regard to the latter, work on further changes to the primary legislation is well advanced and this will broaden the range of products that can be guaranteed and broaden the providers beyond licensed banks, in addition to increasing the level of the guarantee. Any other changes to the scheme would require analysis to ensure a market failure was being met and would have to be scrutinised from both State aid and legal perspectives. Further initiatives involve improvements to the offering of the Credit Review Office, which saw its limit increase to €3 million, and the transition of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to the Irish Strategic Investment Fund. This will help with scale, in respect of which it will be key. There is expertise to ensure the money is spent wisely in the domestic market, and this can lead to major job creation. Yet more initiatives are the rolling out of the national information campaign on late payments and the prompt payment code of conduct portal, and the commitment by Enterprise Ireland of €99.5 million to a number of funds under the seed and venture capital scheme for the period 2013 to 2018, which aims to leverage an additional €300 million from the private sector, making over €500 million in funding available to SMEs. With regard to the current position on bank lending, the Department of Finance, through its SME credit demand survey, has reported that 86% of businesses surveyed had their credit applications approved. With regard to the cost of credit, this survey showed that only 1% of businesses that did not request credit felt it was too expensive to borrow.We all hear stories about the cost of credit here compared to the cost in our European partners and we are constantly working on it. Notwithstanding this, the Government, through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, is taking action on the cost of borrowing for business. Its business model is based primarily on the on-lending model that has been operating successfully in countries such as Germany and Spain. SBCI is a wholesale funder which works with various on-lenders to minimise the overhead expense of the operation and leverage the existing networks and capabilities of on-lenders for the benefit of SMEs. SBCI will ensure access to flexible funding for Irish SMEs by facilitating the provision of flexible products with longer maturity and capital repayment flexibility subject to credit approval; lower cost funding to financial institutions which is, and must be, passed on to SMEs; and market access for new entrants to the SME lending market, creating real competition. SBCI has begun delivering products through Bank of Ireland and AIB. A fair, efficient and competitive tax system is essential for economic growth and job creation, and in each budget the Government has introduced we have worked to improve the economic situation for business and people in Ireland. I will highlight some of relevant tax initiatives the Government has taken. The tax changes for workers introduced in budget 2015 equally benefit all those who pay income tax and or universal social charge, regardless of whether they are self-employed or PAYE workers. Significant improvements have been made to the employment and investment incentive, increasing the amounts of investments raised by small and medium-sized companies under the incentive, which provides an essential alternative source of funding for SMEs. This is an attempt to simplify the process and make it easier. We will shortly launch the start-up refund for entrepreneurs initiative whereby those interested in starting a new company may qualify for a tax refund on income tax paid in previous years to invest in the new company. This simplifies a measure which existed previously, but not everyone knew how to use it. We are trying to make it easier for businesses to access support systems. This is also the case with the JobsPlus scheme which has been discussed at various meetings. We are trying to simplify the supports to create jobs in businesses. The start your own business initiative was introduced in budget 2014. Budget 2014 increased the cash receipts basis threshold for VAT to €2 million. Given the importance of the tourism sector to the Irish economy and the crucial roles tourism-related services play throughout the country, the 2011 jobs initiative introduced a 9% VAT rate, which has proved hugely successful. It has been very beneficial and has certainly led to major job creation. To assist the construction sector we introduced the home renovation incentive in budget 2014, which has brought great benefit to people in their homes and has helped those working in local companies access work and get back into the system. Of course the Government will consider addressing the historical disparities that remain in the tax system between self-assessed and PAYE workers, particularly those at lower levels of equivalent income, as part of our deliberations for budget 2016 subject, of course, to having the required fiscal space. Social protection plays a crucial role in the functioning of our economy and in supporting our SMEs and our people. As well as our Action Plan for Jobs, the Government's Pathways to Work strategy has certainly been a success. It is designed to reduce the numbers on the live register and ensure people are not left behind. Previous recoveries left the long-term unemployed behind and they never got a chance to catch up. The logic behind Pathways to Work is to ensure people are job ready and as close to work as they can possibly be, so when jobs become available they are able to get them and do not miss out on an opportunity. I do not blame anybody, but in the past people got left behind. This cannot and will not happen this time. SMEs are being encouraged to recruit using measures such as JobsPlus, which is a simplified cash support for a business to employ somebody on the live register. It is quite simple and certainly reduces the cost in the early years of employing somebody and helps deal with training. Intreo offices work closely with the local enterprise offices to improve recruitment off the live register by SMEs. Not enough companies have engaged with Intreo offices, but those which have used the service are very complimentary of it. The Intreo offices exist to find talent on the live register and this is what they do. They are doing a good job and we need to encourage their use and get the word out. In terms of raising awareness and communications, the Department of Social Protection undertakes advertising and awareness activities to ensure that all members of the public are made aware of their rights and entitlements and that they are kept informed of significant changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur. We need to get the message out there louder and clearer to businesses. Information on the full range of social welfare schemes and services is available from the Department of Social Protection, Intreo offices, the local office network and the nationwide network of citizen information centres. In addition, many people access information on the websites of the Department of Social Protection and the Citizen Information Board. We need to get the message out to businesses about the many supports which can help their staff and the businesses to create jobs and win new jobs. In September 2013, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection published the third report of the advisory group on tax and social welfare on extending social insurance coverage for the self-employed. The group was asked to examine and report on the issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people to establish whether such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. This is an issue which many Deputies of all parties have raised for a number of years. We all want to see such supports increased if it is financially viable to do so. It has been examined in the report. The group found that the current system of means-tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment. In this context, the group noted that almost nine out of every ten self-employed people who claimed the means-tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment. This message can be lost. Many business people do not realise they are entitled to claim the allowance. I know it is not a nice system to go through and the amount may not reflect the amount of money they had earned and I accept many people choose not to go through the means-tested system. The independent report shows those who did go down that route received the support. Consequently, the group was not convinced there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. The group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long-term sickness or injuries, which possibly reflects many of the messages we receive about people being unable to keep their businesses going after an accident. To this end, the group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes. The group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5%. In general the current system of social insurance operates on a mandatory basis and therefore contributors pay PRSI contributions at the rate appropriate to their PRSI class. Allowing people a facility to opt in or opt out at their own discretion could lead to the selection of bad risks. The whole principle of social insurance is social solidarity, whereby everybody pays in and, if needed, cover is available. We must ensure there is a safety net and that those who choose to go into business realise it is there. We must all work on making this clear. Most business people who suffered during the bad times were shocked to realise they could not receive supports when they needed them. We must get the message out that they can go through the means test system. There is an onus on all of us to improve the system if we can do so. In developing the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 we have embedded an assessment framework that links its objectives and actions to impacts, and which provides a better sense of the direction of progress and helps ensure that actions effectively contribute to the over-arching objective of increased employment. We are introducing closer monitoring of impacts to measure performance and to test areas of opportunity against international benchmarks in the areas of job creation, start-ups, market penetration, innovation, efficiency of public sector interface with enterprises, cost competitiveness, finance and investment and access to talent. In addition to work under the Action Plan for Jobs and measures contained in the budgetary process, the Government has ensured that ongoing dialogue with the small business sector is in place so that businesses and Government can work together to identify necessary actions to support SMEs in Ireland. Raising awareness among SMEs and entrepreneurs of the range of the State-funded supports available remains an ongoing challenge for the public policy system. I touched on this earlier as did previous speakers. We must improve this message and get the word out. We will ensure a continued emphasis on implementing a comprehensive and integrated communications strategy involving the widest possible range of stakeholders in the public and private sectors. This will include facilitating more formal mechanisms for structured, ongoing engagement between Government and SMEs, including the advisory group on small business, the high level group on better regulation and the retail forum. These are opportunities to bring about change, as is the committee system which is the best place for us to work on policy and analysis and make changes. We must strengthen this link. We are also using new and existing communication channels to promote the positive experience of individual SMEs and industry partners of participation in State-sponsored initiatives, notably the network of 31 local enterprise offices.Maintaining an ongoing dialogue with the SME sector in this way can also encourage two-way learning, provide a forum to consider policy solutions, and build trust in the policy development process. An earlier speaker referred to urgency. We have a duty, through agencies and Departments, to move at a greater pace when matters are urgent. Industry sometimes needs quicker changes. Over the years we have done so in the Action Plan for Jobs. In some cases, we have taken Government agencies and Departments out of the way and let people do what they do best. We are also trying to cut red tape and improve the timeline. There is always a difference in the timelines of businesses and Departments. We accept that and there are sometimes genuine reasons for it. Where there are no genuine reasons, we must eliminate delays. Last month marked four years since the Government came to office. It is important that we take a moment to recognise where we started from as a Government. At that time, we faced an unprecedented economic, political and social crisis, the economy was in free fall and our banks were on the verge of collapse. Unemployment was heading for 20%. Everyone was saying so at the time. The first time we referred to 100,000 jobs, people laughed at us and said we could not achieve it and that it could not be done. It was Government-aided, but the private sector answered the call and engaged with us through the new system of the Action Plan for Jobs to create jobs. Almost all of the extra jobs that have been created are full time and they are real jobs. It is important that people have a little hope. I get disappointed when Deputies from different parties suggest that these are not real jobs. They are real jobs and Members should recognise that. I recognise there are not enough jobs for everyone, but where there are real and good jobs, we should build on the success and the hope factor and not knock it. They are not all labour activation schemes. There is little difference between the number of labour activation schemes now and those in the good times. These are real jobs and we should recognise that. We can all recognise things we are unhappy with and the need to scale up, but we should also recognise where there are improvements that are beneficial to the country and that we want to build on. We are well ahead of the target and we are trying to build on it. We hope to reach full employment in 2018. The economy is growing, unemployment is falling and the confidence of our people and businesses is returning. Our focus now as a Government is to secure the recovery and ensure that everyone feels the benefits of it in their daily lives and in their pockets. We will ensure that our economy is built on a solid foundation of sustainability, with a clear enterprise focus that supports enterprise and jobs. That is the difference, as the clear enterprise focus to support enterprise and jobs was not there in the past. Enterprise-driven jobs that would last forever were not guaranteed. When there was an international crisis, it hit us badly in Ireland because we had not created enough enterprise-driven jobs that would last through good and bad times. As a Government, we will continue to maintain our focus on assisting SMEs in establishing themselves, scaling up and exporting in order to ensure that they continue to drive our economic recovery and create further jobs. We will continue to work hard to secure the recovery and ensure that the fruits of our efforts are felt by all of our people. We have set ourselves strong and measurable goals for our economy, for employment and for the public finances for the years ahead and we are implementing the policies that will achieve those targets.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	397	I propose to share time with Deputy Michael Colreavy. Cuirim fáilte roimh an rún. Tugann ár bpáirtí tacaíocht do chuspóirí an rúin atá os ár gcomhair. There can be no recovery in our society without the support of our SME sector. Seventy percent of people employed in Ireland are employed in the SME sector. That is an incredible statistic, which should put in sharp focus where most workers work. Last year, a tiny number of jobs were created outside the greater Dublin area. Since this Government came to power, four people have left for every one job created. Those in the west and north west are all too aware of the regional imbalances, which have been made worse by the complete collapse in capital investment that this Government seems to pride itself on. The potential jobs in rebuilding our infrastructure are not being created, while our infrastructure crumbles, unless one thinks of Irish Water as a good example of State capital investment. It has been a characteristic of this economy for decades that our entire industrial policy is predicated on attracting foreign direct investment to the State. FDI plays a huge and essential part in our economy, but it is only common sense not to put all our eggs in the one basket. Ultimately, multinationals will go where their profits can be maximised. In this day and age of modern technology, multinationals are freer than in the past to move at short notice to new bases. Increasingly, the economic statistics of the entire State can be distorted by the FDI sector. This was clear with last year's growth figures, where contract manufacturing made up half of the growth, an anomaly as reported by the CSO. SMEs, on the other hand, are tied to the local community and will remain so. We are grateful that this is the case. They are the core of the real economy and the bedrock on which all economic development must be built and maintained. We could be forgiven for asking where are the special tax deals for SMEs. Does the Government roll out the red carpet for SMEs or bend the rules when asked? If we are to have a fair recovery, our economic policy should maintain a strong attraction for FDI but also give due importance to SMEs. I agree with the proposal in the motion to begin a process whereby the self-employed can voluntarily sign up to the social insurance system and avail of jobseeker’s benefit and illness benefit. It is something my party has long called for, and in my time in the Seanad I articulated the point time and again. There is certainly a disparity in tax treatment between PAYE workers and the self-employed, but that does not mean the self-employed are necessarily disadvantaged in all cases. A much wider range of allowances are available to the self-employed, and that must be factored into any discussion on taxation of PAYE workers and the self-employed. Where Sinn Féin has differed from the cosy consensus of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party is that our economic vision is about building a sustainable economy, not simply rebuilding the house that collapsed. We do not believe in trying to rebuild on flimsy foundations. We believe in real growth in the Irish economy and a fair recovery. It is not a sudden conversion to the idea of growth that the Government is embracing. We did not wait years for growth but made it clear our policies would have brought it about. The effect of Sinn Féin’s policies would have been to boost, not reduce, consumer demand. It was about putting money back into people’s pockets, money that could be spent in local businesses and the local economy. Over the past seven years, since the crisis began, the biggest factor that has hurt SMEs and the self-employed is the austerity policies peddled by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, which reduced domestic demand and took many businesses to the wall or put them under severe pressure. Our party favours progressive policies that would support our SME sector. Specifically, we have argued for the abolition of upward-only rent reviews. If Labour Party Deputies were in the Chamber, they might remember the policy. Without any evidence, we were told that this raised constitutional issues, but we have advice to the contrary. In the case of the IBRC liquidation, these property rights that the Government spearheads could be overridden for the common good. For city centre shopkeepers in particular, the problem has not gone away. Small businesses, including the mortgage holders of IBRC, are now in the hands of vultures. Some SMEs cannot establish who owns their loans now. That is the esteem in which this Government holds SMEs. The cost of electricity and other utilities is a major weight on SMEs. A cap on these costs should be considered for a period. A more progressive rates system, something Sinn Féin has called for over a number of years, should be on the table. Nobody argues that a flat tax on income is equitable, yet when it comes to business rates, we expect an SME to pay the same rate as a multinational or a branch of a large supermarket chain, for example. These are just some of the proposals we published last year in our Putting SMEs First strategy. There are many others, such as a Border corridor zone that would have an impact on businesses in that area as a result of fluctuating currencies and differing laws and regulations on either side.We have mentioned procurement, an issue Deputy Mary Lou McDonald has been raising for many years in this Chamber.

However, we see that the contrary is the case, and many SMEs are ruled out of bidding as a result of the archaic rules that apply to that type of procurement. Our Putting SMEs First policy document contains ten proposals the Government could implement. I could compare the title of that document with the Government's initiative on SMEs, which might be called "SMEs - an Afterthought". Where is the Government plan to allow everyone to have an e-business platform, for example? We know how much businesses are losing as a result of them not being e-mobile. The Government motion is remarkably lacklustre in even pretending it is acting to help our SME sector. It consists only of references to documents and statements without any supporting evidence. It is an insult to that sector. We need to step up to the mark and to prioritise this sector as it has 70% of the jobs in this State. We need to do it with a full analysis of the figures and with a full understanding of the taxation models that apply for the SME sector and the PAYE sectors. As Fianna Fáil Deputies said earlier, there is no harm in somebody earning over €100,000. People who take risks should be rewarded. However, we must ask ourselves in these straitened times whether we want to give tax cuts to those individuals, to lift more people out of poverty or to help those self-employed people - the chippies, the plumbers and the people who provide services in rural communities and who are hardly making a bob, never mind €100,000 a year - by taking away some of the punitive measures that same party introduced, such as the household levy and its plan for water charges. Our focus is clear. It is about putting more money into people's pockets and ensuring that money is put into the pockets of those people who are hard-pressed in society, the people who will spend every penny they have in the economy. When they do that, it ensures that the self-employed and small and medium enterprises can continue to employ themselves, make a living for themselves and continue to ensure they have a role in rebuilding society from the ground up.  Some of the remarks I have heard today are lacking in ambition and in vision for the sector, but I welcome the fact that the focus on this sector has been brought to the Dáil Chamber tonight as a result of Fianna Fáil's motion. It is badly needed. We have discussed time and again, at the finance committee and in the Dáil, the importance of FDI and the 12.5% rate, but there is no due regard for the thousands of people who have become self-employed, who do not have the safety net of the social welfare system, who have been promised that for many years and who still have to rely on idle words from the Government in the twilight of its time in power. As I said, I agree with the spirit of the motion, although I do not agree with everything Fianna Fáil has said tonight. Some of it is misguided in terms of the facts, but there is a fundamental need to ensure that supports and safety nets are there for the self-employed and SMEs, that public procurement is opened up to SMEs, that Government assists the self-employed and SMEs to get online so that we can compete in an international market, and to ensure that money goes back into the pockets of those who need the money, so that they can spend it in the economy, which will be a boost to the self-employed and to the SME sector.

#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	405	In the north west of Ireland, owners and employees of small and medium-sized businesses smile ruefully when they hear the oft-expressed opinion of Government spokespersons that the economy is growing and employment is being created. They look around at closing shops, pubs, cafes and commercial businesses, or see businesses barely surviving on hope of improvement, and they wonder when their economy, the real economy, will begin to improve. They see previously self-employed people who paid tax and social welfare in respect of their employees now virtually destitute with the closure of their businesses. They clearly see a picture that is at odds with the picture being painted by Government in the run-up to an election. As I have only a few minutes to speak on this, I will confine my remarks to the need to radically reform the business rating system and utility costs for business. The system for calculating business rates is causing untold damage to small businesses throughout the land. The system is regressive, it is not linked in any way to profit or income, it is a notional figure that bears no relationship to reality and it is strangling small businesses. I know several small businesses in Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Donegal that are simply unable to continue because the rates burden added to the already heavy water and waste collection charges cannot be met from the reduced customer footfall to their businesses. What is the sense of developing new incentives when the current illogical Government finance extraction schemes are sucking the life blood from these enterprises? Utility costs are a major impediment to the development and growth of SMEs in Ireland. The Forfás Cost of Doing Business in Ireland report, released in 2013, highlighted the significant costs facing SMEs and affecting their competitiveness and that of the State. It found that Ireland is the fourth most expensive country in the euro area for diesel. Electricity costs for SMEs are the fourth highest among the 15 countries in the euro area. Waste costs remain high, particularly landfill fees. While the cost of a bundle of telephone calls is relatively competitive, Ireland is expensive in terms of broadband costs, particularly when broadband quality is considered. International research shows that the Internet contributes up to 6% of GDP in advanced economies and most of the economic value created occurs outside the information technology sector, with 75% of the benefits captured by companies in more traditional industries. The research also found that the Internet created 2.6 jobs for every one lost due to technology-related efficiencies. Broadband is considered an essential infrastructure priority for enterprise growth. Fairness dictates that businesses need to be better supported and penalised less in all regions. To do this, all regions need to have a strong infrastructure base enabling them to compete, as well as to attract and retain investment and jobs. Since the liberalisation of the telecommunications market, private investment has been driving the roll-out of broadband infrastructure and services nationally, and internationally. Just as with other types of infrastructure provision, population density is a determinant of the cost of delivery and potential returns. Does the Acting Chair want me to finish off with one minute to go?

On the one hand, the State says to people that it wants them to be entrepreneurial and innovative, that it wants them to set up new companies, to take risks, and to employ people, and that they are the backbone of the economy.We hear this all the time. When I came into politics four years ago we heard it all the time from the previous Government. They said they respected and admired entrepreneurs and the self employed, and that they should go for at. At the same time, the State, this and the previous Government, says it will tax the self employed at a higher rate than PAYE workers. A self-employed person earning more than €100,000 pays 4% more tax than a PAYE worker, a self-employed person earning €50,000 pays 11% more and a self-employed person earning €15,000 pays nearly seven times more tax than a PAYE worker. As every Deputy knows, a self-employed person who has taken the risk and done what the State said, is afforded a fraction of the social protections a PAYE worker receives. We all know this because we are all trying to help self-employed people whose businesses have gone to the wall during the recession. It is hypocrisy. The State tells people to go out, set up businesses, take risks, invest their own money and try to employ people, but states, "By the way, we are going to tax you more and God help you if you fail". It is not good enough. There are 324,000 self employed people in the country, 100,000 of whom earn less than €50,000. The Government can introduce two policies within a matter of months. In the budget, it can equalise tax treatment, and in the Social Welfare Bill that accompanies the budget, it can equalise social protections.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Message from Seanad	410	I will concentrate on the PRSI and social welfare treatment of self employed people. As the motion stated, there are approximately 350,000 self-employed people in the country. Many of these are working in jobs that would traditionally have been employee jobs but, because of moves by the employers, are on contracts for services and have become de facto self employed although they have no control over their incomes and potential for earnings. One of the most difficult aspects of the recession to deal with at the height of the financial collapse was trying to explain to formerly self-employed people that they were not entitled to any social welfare or social protection when their businesses had failed and they were looking for a safety net. It took a long time for the Department of Social Protection to come to terms with it and ease the burden on them and their ability to access jobseeker's allowance, which is a means-tested payment. Finally, it acted and made it slightly easier for the self employed to access the payment. Self-employed people should have a right to social protection and should pay the additional contributions to ensure they have the right to access social protection under the PRSI system. In 2012, I drafted legislation to give this right to self-employed people but, unfortunately, due to the archaic rules of the House, it was ruled out of order on the grounds that an Opposition Deputy cannot introduce legislation that might increase taxation. Tonight's motion calls for voluntary contribution system to be introduced for self employed people. However, a voluntary system will not work. We already have a voluntary system of PRSI contributions for self-employed fishermen whereby they can pay an additional 4% contribution voluntarily and avail of limited social protection benefits. Over the years it has been in operation, an average of seven to nine self employed fishermen have availed of it, and this is because it is voluntary. Nobody volunteers to pay tax, even though they may benefit from it in the future, and PRSI is seen as a tax. However, social protection should be extended to self-employed people under a compulsory system, and this is vitally important. We should recognise that self-employed people are less likely to become unemployed due to the nature of self employment. Given that they also employ people, we should have a favourable PRSI system that provides benefits for them.
