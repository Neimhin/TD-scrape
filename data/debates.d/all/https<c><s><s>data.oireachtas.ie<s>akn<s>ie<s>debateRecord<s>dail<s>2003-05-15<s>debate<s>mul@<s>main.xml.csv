#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic I have received notice from Deputy Connolly and I call on him to state the matter.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the ongoing strike at Shannonside Northern Sound, the likelihood of a serious escalation of this strike, and the necessity for the directors and the chief executive officer of the station to observe their own agreed procedures for the settlement of disputes.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the fact that farm families in Cavan-Monaghan, and in other parts of the country, are not being paid their REPS grants or having their applications under farm waste and development grants processed. This applies to those seeking approval and those who have completed their work for payment, yet farmers are under request or order from the local authority and the Department of Agriculture and Food to carry out farm waste management and dairy hygiene projects. Furthermore, under the Department of Agriculture and Food's protocol, first-time REPS grants are supposed to be paid within 12 weeks of application with second and subsequent payments at ten weeks.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Having considered the matters raised, I do not believe they are contemplated by Standing Order 31 and therefore I cannot grant leave to move the motions.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 1a, Redundancy Payments Bill 2003 [Seanad] – Second and Subsequent Stages; No. 2, Garda Síochána (Police Co-operation) Bill 2003 [Seanad] – Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 7 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 1a: the proceedings on Second Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion after three and a half hours; the opening speech of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; and the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case. Members may share time and the Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes. The proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No.1a agreed? Agreed. Is the pro posal for the sitting and business of the Dáil tomorrow agreed?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I understand the reason advanced for the sitting tomorrow is that the Taoiseach intends that the House will rise again in the week after the June bank holiday. I submit that it is unconsionable that the Taoiseach would again close down the House and that Friday is no alternative for the Opposition. There is no Order of Business, no Leaders' Questions, no questions to the Taoiseach and no votes or divisions permitted. There is no Adjournment allowed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	12	There is no Taoiseach.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	13	There is no Taoiseach. The argument is being made retrospectively that Friday sittings make up for that. They most emphatically do not, and I ask the Minister for Defence now, well in advance of the June bank holiday, to review that commitment as it is damaging the House. It allows the kind of snide comment that can be seen in one newspaper again this morning. Notwithstanding that, the Government seems to  be willing, at every opportunity, to inflict damage on the standing of the House because it does not want its Ministers to be here. I do not particularly want to oppose tomorrow's sitting.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	14	By standing up, the Deputy is opposing it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	15	If it makes the Ceann Comhairle happy, I will oppose it for the reasons I have outlined.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I understand that the calendar issued last September has not changed. There are plenty of opportunities for Deputies anxious to make contributions to do so here. I reject out of hand Deputy Rabbitte's suggestion that any Ministers do not want to be in this House.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	17	If the Members opposite wish to examine the record of this House to find out who wastes time, they will not have to look too far.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Yesterday my office was informed the Tánaiste would take the Order of Business this morning. I note the House is dealing with the Redundancy Payments Bill 2003 as the first issue and the Tánaiste is not present. I received a message from the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, last night to say he would be taking it today. This may well be related to a reply given by the Taoiseach yesterday to Deputy Rabbitte in respect of his question about the Government decision in relation to third level fees. In respect of Vote 29 on Tuesday's Order Paper, the Taoiseach said yesterday that the Government seemed to be talking about an echelon of society at a very high level, presumably of the order of an income of €150,000 or €200,000. May we have clarification from the Minister for Defence on behalf of the Government about Vote 29—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	19	That matter can be debated when Vote 29 comes before the House.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	28	—that because the Progressive Democrats are not present. The president of the Progressive Democrats has been offering candidates ministries around the country. It is no wonder the justice system is gone to pot.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I indicated that the legislation was under review and was likely to be introduced in 2004.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I asked you a question, Sir. Was it the responsibility of the Minister to answer a question I raised about a Bill or was it your job to protect the Government? That was my question and it is for you to answer it.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The Deputy is out of order. He is casting a reflection on the impartiality of the Chair.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Many people will welcome the fact that the Government has to some extent agreed to hold a debate on the world trade talks in Cancun in September. Will the debate contain the necessary questions and answers, especially in view of the seriousness of the issue and the fact that two junior Ministers have been sent to the talks to represent the interests of this country?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	123	A question on legislation.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	130	The Bord Bia Bill is the only promised legislation to address these issues, although it is hardly relevant to the broader context of the WTO. When will the Bill be introduced? I also ask that the debate on the world trade talks include a question and answer session, especially in view of the seriousness of a United States trade war against the European Union on the question of genetically modified food.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The first matter raised by the Deputy can be discussed between the Whips at the appropriate time.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Will the Minister indicate when the legislation dealing with increases in the number of office holders will be introduced or is it the case that the jobs given by the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to anybody who agrees to run for election on behalf of the Progressive Democrats will be taken from the Fianna Fáil pool? Will the Minster's job be given away or will it be the Minster of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	133	The Deputy's question should relate to promised legislation. I call Deputy Costello.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Instead of running the justice system, the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is offering bribes by way of ministerial office to anybody and everybody who will run for election on behalf of the Progressive Democrats. Is the Government going to increase the number of offices or is he promising the jobs of his colleagues?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	135	If that is all the Deputy has to worry about he is all right.

The Minister has promised to establish an inspectorate but there is no sign of it being drafted.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	142	As I speak without notes, I am open to correction but, as the Deputy knows, the Government is pursuing a number of actions to deal with this particular issue.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Like the grand old Duke of York.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	145	The Minister should not look at me. I did not say anything.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Is the Deputy the prince of pretence? This matter is being actively pursued in the appropriate way.

Is it not the case that such land should be offered to local authorities to provide housing?

This morning, I read in a newspaper that the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, said yesterday that State land would be offered to private builders at half price. That information was not provided to this House yesterday by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.

One of the answers is incorrect. Either the House was given the wrong information or incorrect information was given outside the House. If that is allowed to continue, it means the House is being treated with contempt. We cannot tolerate that. Other whips and I have made submissions to the Government to address this issue.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	174	The Order of Business is not a free-for-all question time.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, is present and could answer.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	176	Allow the Minister responsible for the Order of Business this morning to speak.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I have already indicated to the House that no legislation is promised in this area. It is a well known fact that active consideration is being given to the question of access to land to enable the development of affordable and social housing. A number of different propositions are being put forward. Surely, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the Minister of State indicating the State's willingness to make land owned by it available to allow this to happen.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	178	It should be made available to local authorities.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	179	Local authorities do not build houses, builders do.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Local authorities—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	181	We cannot have a debate on the matter.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	182	On a point of order, the questions raised yesterday were properly tabled questions for priority answer. There was a series of supplementary questions which invited a response regarding land. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government did not tell this House that the Government plans to sell State land to private builders. The Minister of  State responsible for housing and urban renewal said that outside the House.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	183	That is not in order at this stage, but if the Deputy would listen to the Chair for a second—
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	184	No, we are entitled to some rights. We are entitled to receive answers to questions when those questions are put down in a proper way.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	185	It is not in order to accuse a member of the Government of deliberately misleading the House by allegedly concealing information or otherwise.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	186	Deputy Gilmore did not say that.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	187	If an allegation of this nature is to be made against any Member, it should only be done by way of substantive motion. Deputy Gilmore is out of order at this stage and I call on his colleague, Deputy Costello, to speak.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I did not make that allegation. I asked if the information given in the House or the information given in newspaper reports was accurate.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The Deputy is out of order.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Which version is correct?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	192	To be as helpful as I can to the Deputy, there is nothing new in the proposal to dispose of State lands for housing. As Minister for Defence, I have disposed of lands to local authorities from my property portfolio for social housing purposes and Opposition Members know that. There is nothing new about what the Minister said.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	193	What about the local authorities?

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	195	The Minister should tell us what the Government is considering.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	196	There is nothing new about what was said.

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	198	Some time ago, I was told by the Taoiseach in this House that the Defence Forces (hearing loss compensation) Bill was withdrawn.  Why then does it appear in the most recently published Order Paper?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Here is a question to which the Minister knows the answer.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	200	Deputy Sherlock is correct to say the Bill remains on the Order Paper. As the Deputy knows, a successful pilot scheme I helped to introduce is disposing of the outstanding claims speedily and affordably.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The same cannot be said for the pilots of the Garda helicopter.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Please allow me to speak. Should it happen that anything different occurs in terms of the pilot scheme and the remaining 2,000 claims to be disposed of, we will consider reintroducing the legislation referred to by the Deputy. It is extremely unlikely that we will, but the Bill will be borne in mind should the scheme—
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Collapse.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	205	When will the urgently required science foundation Bill be brought before the House? How quickly does the Government intend to complete the business on this important legislation?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	206	It looks like Kilkenny is winning again. The Bill will be taken this session.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I thank the Minister. Kilkenny was able to come back even when Tipperary was eight points ahead.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	208	If Tipperary cannot win when they are eight points ahead, there is a problem.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	209	There is some confusion about the role of the national treatment purchase fund, particularly in the negotiations it appears to be having with the Mater Hospital. The Minister for Health and Children indicated his intention to put the national treatment purchase fund on a statutory footing, but there is no indication of that in the legislative programme. Will the Minister indicate what exactly the plans are?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I will communicate with the Deputy directly, but my understanding is that there is no promised legislation in this regard. As the Deputy knows, the scheme itself is working satisfactorily and many patients are having excellent experiences through it. It is an innovative scheme which is working extremely well.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Hear, hear.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18323	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Public beds in the Mater Hospital are being closed.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I do not wish to delay the House, but if I allow the Minister's answer to pass, it would lead to an unfortunate impression. My understanding is that secondary legislation has been promised in principle and the Minister needs to be aware of that.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Secondary legislation does not have to be dealt with today. It can be deferred to another day.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	215	Is there any Government scheme that is not behind?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I am entitled to ask a question.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	217	The Deputy has asked her question and the Minister has answered it. There is no primary legislation.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I know that.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	220	Why not?

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I asked the Minister when the secondary legislation to put the fund on a statutory footing will come before the House. When will we see it? Will it be brought to our attention?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I have already indicated that there is no primary legislation and that I would communicate with the Deputy on that matter. I do not have an exact date.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18323	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I do not know whether Roscrea is a hub, a spoke, a puncture or what in the National Spatial Plan. Nonetheless, why do we not have the promised legislation from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the legislative programme to give legal force to the spatial plan so we can have some confidence that this is not just another document published just to gather dust in a corner? What has happened to this promised legislation that does not appear anywhere in the programme?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I have no promised legislation in the area.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18323	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I know there is not. The question is why not?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	227	It is not required.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has promised a Garda bicycle for Blanchardstown at several public functions in recent months. Does the pro duction of Garda bicycles in Blanchardstown require secondary or primary legislation? How many bikes will we get and when might we actually see them? We have been promised them for 3 or 4 months.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	230	The Deputies can cycle away on that one.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The building control Bill has been mentioned repeatedly by a number of interested agencies outside the House but for some unknown reason it has become stalled in the traffic. It is peculiar because developments are taking place with haste throughout the country, obviously to get in before the controls are instituted. These developments are taking place without any planning permission. When will the legislation impact on such activities?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	232	The building control Bill will be published late this year.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	233	That will be too late. By late this year, all these unauthorised developments will have taken place and nothing will have been done about them.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I suggest the Deputy submits a question to the appropriate Minister.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Does the Government have any intention of introducing parallel legislation to the public service management recruitment and appointments Bill to deal with the area of public appointments, particularly political appointments?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	242	In between promising candidates ministries, the Minister for Justice, Equality and  Law Reform has promised a reserve force for the Garda. The Estimate for the Garda Síochána is €963 million. Has the Cabinet discussed the heads of either primary or secondary legislation in respect of this reserve force? Has consideration been given to the numbers, role and responsibilities of the force, whether or not they will wear a different uniform and what duties will be assigned to them?

It is a matter of procedure on which we might be able to be of assistance to each other. The forthcoming WTO conference in Cancun will be attended by, among others, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for development aid and the Minister of State with responsibility for trade. My question relates simply to the ordering of business. Will the proposals of the Irish Government be simultaneously introduced in the different committees of this House, such as the foreign affairs committee, the agriculture committee and the trade committee? Will there be consultation before the proposals are introduced so that we can all have an opportunity to make our views known before the conference takes place?The difficulty that will arise is that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will have a particular view that is not consistent with that of the Minister of State with responsibility for trade or the Minister of State with responsibility for development aid. A decision will have to be made on this fairly soon. Will the Government's position – not that of any one Department – be simultaneously put before all the relevant committees, including those dealing with foreign affairs, European affairs, agriculture and trade, so that such committees will have the opportunity of meeting the NGOs and other groups with an interest in these matters and expressing their views before the conference takes place, and if necessary composing the delegation?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am very pleased to be here to move this important legislation. I thank both Deputy Hogan and Deputy Howlin for their co-operation in ensuring that this Bill has a speedy passage through the Oireachtas. The Bill provides for the implementation of the enhancements to redundancy payment levels and other improvements to the operation of the redundancy scheme that are provided for in the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, and the report of the redundancy review group. The Bill will also amend the insolvency payments legislation to allow employees of insolvent companies to claim their minimum notice entitlements under the insolvency payments scheme through a liquidator or receiver without first having to obtain an award from the employment appeals tribunal.In April 2002, the Government established a review group, in the context of social partnership, to examine the operation of the statutory redundancy payments scheme so as to ensure the scheme best met the requirements of employers and employees. The review group, which reported back to me and the Government in July 2002, agreed a range of changes to the scheme,  including a simpler method for calculating service, changes in the treatment of absences from work, treatment of service abroad, simplification of application forms and a new IT system, including an e-government aspect. The group did not reach consensus on issues such as an increase in the level of statutory redundancy payments and size of rebate to employers. The partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, endorsed the changes agreed by the redundancy review group and provided in addition that the distinction between service under and over 41 years would be removed, there would be two weeks pay for every year of service, the bonus week would be retained, and the rebate of 60% to the employer would also be retained.On 18 February 2003 the Government approved the drafting of a Bill on a priority basis to give effect to the new enhanced redundancy payments scheme. The Government decision also approved the provision of a sum of €1 million to cover the cost of supporting IT, the funding of administration costs and operational overheads, including the enhancement of supporting IT, to be made from the social insurance fund, with arrangements to be put in place with the Departments of Finance and Social and Family Affairs. The Government also agreed to amend the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts 1984 to 2001 to enable employees of insolvent companies to make claims for minimum notice entitlements under the scheme without having to obtain an award from the employment appeals tribunal.On 30 April 2003 the Government approved the text of a Bill to give effect to the new enhanced redundancy payments scheme and the amendment to the insolvency payments scheme. The Government decision of 30 April also approved the presentation of the Bill to Seanad Éireann and circulation to Senators. The Bill was published on 7 May 2003.When the improved statutory redundancy payments come into operation, it is estimated that a full year's cost of payments from the social insurance fund, based on the 2002 level of redundancies at around 24,000, will be in the region of €149 million. This is an increase of €96 million in the annual cost to bring the new enhanced rates into effect. An amendment of the redundancy IT system will be required to implement the full range of changes set out in the new Bill, at a cost in the region of €1 million. It is anticipated that the new system, when it is fully operational, will simplify administration, especially for employers. It will also bring improved efficiencies in administration by the Department.Section 3 of the Bill provides that the administrative costs of redundancy and insolvency be met from the social insurance fund by means of an appropriation in aid to the Vote of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This will provide greater accounting transparency, in that all costs – payments as well as administration – will be funded by the SIF. Detailed  arrangements have been agreed between the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance and Social and Family Affairs to implement these changes.There are two pieces of legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. Firstly, as the payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum is a legal requirement on employers, it could not be imposed on them with retrospective effect. In fact, employers are entitled to due notice of the intention to legally require them to pay enhanced rates. The Nokia case of 1984 was related to this: the then Minister for Labour sought to impose increases on employers and that was successfully challenged in the courts. Secondly, the new Redundancy Act has to be brought into effect by ministerial order after enactment by the Oireachtas. This cannot be made retrospective.I hereby give advance notice to all employers that it is my intention to try to ensure that the new redundancy payment levels will come into effect on Sunday, 25 May 2003 or as soon as possible thereafter. This will require swift passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. The Government has also approved an early signature motion which will be going to the Seanad later this afternoon on the assumption that the Bill passes this House by the appointed 3.30 p.m. deadline. Employees who are issued with notice of redundancy on 25 May or later will be entitled to two weeks pay per for each year of service, plus a bonus week.It is proposed that when this Bill has passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas and is enacted, a commencement order will be made so that most sections of the Bill will become effective, including the increased payment amounts. However, section 9 will be brought into effect on 30 January 2004, while sections 7, 11 and 12, will not come into effect until well into 2004 when the new IT system becomes fully operational. A commencement order giving effect to these three sections will be made at that time.Section 1 provides definitions of terms used in the Act. Section 2 provides that the social insurance fund may cover the administration costs of the redundancy and insolvency schemes.Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 2(1) of the principal Act by inserting up to date definitions of "contract of employment", "employee" and "employer". These definitions are similar to those given in the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001 and other legislation, that is, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and the Carer's Leave Act 2001.Section 4 provides for the amendment of section 4 of the principal Act, which deals with the insurability of an employee. The purpose of amending this section is to add clarity to the insurability requirements in line with the Social Welfare Acts and the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001.Section 5 provides for the amendment of section 8(2) of the principal Act. The Employment Appeals Tribunal when dealing with redun dancy cases has long been of the view that redundancy is impersonal. According to the tribunal in the case of St. Ledger v. Frontline Distributors Ltd., the statutory definition of "redundancy" has two important characteristics, namely "impersonality" and "change". This section is designed to provide certainty in this regard.Section 6 provides for the amendment of section 9(1)(b) of the principal Act to include fixed purpose contracts and when the fixed purpose contract ceases there is a redundancy situation.Section 7 provides for the amendment of section 17 of the principal Act. The position at present is that the three forms RP1, RP2 and RP3 are the main ones used for statutory redundancy. They contain a good deal of repetition and will be amalgamated into one form when the new IT system is available later this year; this one form will be the basis for any rebate or lump sum claim.Section 8 provides for the amendment of section 25 of the principal Act to include an employee who started work in an employment abroad, is transferred to the company or associated company in this jurisdiction, works here for a least two years and is subsequently made redundant while working here; he will be entitled to statutory redundancy for his entire service from the date of commencement of his employment in the company abroad.Section 9 provides for the amendment of section 39(2) of the principal Act so that the vice-chairmen of the Employment Appeals Tribunal must have been practising barristers or solicitors for at least five years. The existing service provision for the chairperson is seven years.Section 10 provides for the amendment of paragraph 1 subparagraph (a) of Schedule 3 to the principal Act by substituting “two weeks” for “one-half” and subparagraph (b) by inserting after “product of”“two weeks of”. These amendments are known as transitional arrangements, which will allow for the payments of increased statutory redundancy levels as soon as the Act comes into force following minor changes to the IT system. These arrangements will cease to have effect on the commencement of section 11.Section 11 provides for the amendment of Schedule 3 to the principal Act by substituting new paragraphs for paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 to allow for enhanced redundancy payments of two weeks pay per year of service plus one extra week's pay. Any excess days will be credited as a portion of a year. These arrangements will come into force when a new IT system becomes fully operational.Section 12 provides that continuity of service is preserved when there are certain breaks in employment. It also provides that certain breaks in service are reckonable in the calculation of a lump sum except breaks occurring in the three year period prior to the date of termination of employment. These arrangements will come into force when a new IT system becomes fully operational.Section 13 provides for penalties that may be imposed on people who defraud the system.Section 14 provides that the minimum rates of pay laid down in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, as updated, be taken into account when calculating a statutory redundancy lump sum.Section 15 provides for the amendment of section 6 of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 to 2001. At present, where a worker in an insolvent firm has not received statutory notice, it is necessary to take the case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to determine the minimum notice entitlement. In order to streamline the process and relieve pressure on the Employment Appeals Tribunal it is proposed to allow these employees to submit claims to the liquidator or receiver without having to go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, thereby diverting these cases from the tribunal and ensuring a better service.Section 16 provides for the repeal of section 17 (4) of the Employment Equality Act 1998. This section exempted the existing calculation of a statutory redundancy lump sum, which differentiates between service under and over the age of 41, from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act 1998.Section 17 is a standard provision, which provides for the short title of the Act and the collective citation of the Act with other relevant Acts and the standard commencement provisions.I acknowledge the work done by the social partners within the Redundancy Review Group, which reported to me last autumn. That group proposed several improvements to the operation of the scheme to make it more intelligible for employers and employees and to streamline the scheme. These improvements are included in the Bill and will improve efficiency and customer service.In the negotiations for Sustaining Progress all social partners reached agreement to increase the level of statutory redundancy payments. This ability of the social partners to reach consensus shows the strength of our social partnership process.I am very pleased to bring this Bill before the House. The method of calculation of the statutory redundancy lump sum and the level of payments have not changed, except for the ceiling on the weekly wage and a small change in 1979, since the redundancy scheme came into operation in 1968 some 25 years ago. This legislation is timely. It will give a reasonable level of increased statutory payments to employees who are unlucky enough to lose their jobs through redundancy. For some it will be a fourfold increase, for others it will be a doubling of what they would get by way of statutory redundancy. It is hoped the increased lump sum payments will help to alleviate the financial hardship caused by redundancy until these employees find alternative employment.I wish to make this point concerning meetings I had with redundant workers because I have no doubt it will arise. I never assured anybody that his or her statutory redundancy payment would be backdated. I was not in a position to do that. In the first instance, when I met workers on 12 December last, we had not even agreed to increase the level of statutory redundancy. I said to those, and perhaps to other, workers that I would do my best to ensure that they were included, and I did my best. I cannot set aside constitutional law. I had to accept the view of the Attorney General. This matter was discussed at length in Cabinet, but unfortunately it is not possible, notwithstanding some very hard cases, to make the enhanced payment of statutory redundancy payable on a retrospective basis. That is the legal, factual position. Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about that, notwithstanding my best endeavours and the best endeavours of my officials.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The publication and the debate on this Bill is an ideal opportunity for us to reflect on the current condition of the economy. Since 1994 Ireland has undergone enormous change, none more so than the number of jobs created, record exports and positive economic news generally. Never before in the history of the State have so many opportunities been available for our people to develop to their full potential and to become involved in the economic development of the nation.During those years there was great expectation that issues related to education, health, transport and child care, to name but a few, could be resolved with the upturn in the economy and the available finances to the Government. In those years the Celtic tiger roared and the Government engaged in the largest ever spending splurge experienced with increases in public expenditure of the order of 20% in the years 2000, 2001 and in the earlier part of 2002, but it all came to a stop in June 2002. Any independent observer would have expected the problems that Ireland had faced and failed to tackle over of the years due to a lack of finance could have been tackled with a cost effective value for money approach that would sustain the economy and the people in their employment into the future.The failure of the Fianna Fáil-PD Government to keep the nation's finances in order was acknowledged by the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in March 2002 when he stated that sanity would have to prevail in respect of the finances of our country when the general election was over. That statement surely summarises the cynical approach taken in 2001 and 2002 by the Government collectively, but specifically by the Minister for Finance and the Progressive Democrats at the Cabinet table who squandered the boom in an outrageous fashion, which has led to the rapid deterioration in our economic indicators in the past eight months.This Fianna Fáil-PD Government has imposed taxes on jobs by imposing a high number of indirect taxes in the last budget and since the election. It is estimated the Governrment has contributed to 2% of our current high inflation rate in the economy because of decisions made in the previous budget and by rapidly increasing the cost to consumers and businesses of indirect taxes and public utilities. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government is contributing to 800 job losses per week and a doubling in the number of notified redundancies since the general election.The Irish Exporters Association recently stated that the continuing downturn in global markets and the persistent deterioration in exchange rates as well as out-of-control inflation were impacting on the ability of our exporters to retain employees. The association estimated that job losses would reach 25,000 in 2003.The main findings of the Small Firms Association ninth national employment survey provides more reading for the Minister. It showed a 58% decline in the demand for labour, that 62% of companies have no vacancies, that the number of projected new jobs has decreased from 36,238 to 17,420, and that demand for foreign and part-time workers has decreased substantially. The director of the Small Firms Association, Mr. Delaney, stated that any further losses in competitiveness would have serious consequences in terms of job losses. The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association has painted a similarly gloomy picture on the employment front.The question that must be asked of the Minister and the Government is where it has gone wrong in terms of the competitiveness of the economy. We have gone during her term in office from being fifth in the world in 1996 in terms of competitiveness to 24th in the world today. How could the successes of three to four years ago have been frittered away and how could there have been a failure to sustain a competitive economy today?The Acting Chairman and I know the fragile nature of many of the traditional industries and many jobs have been lost in his county of Donegal. Many actions were promised in that regard, including task force reports and ministerial interventions. Regrettably, the fact is that we are now less competitive against countries in the Far East or eastern Europe, and the challenge is growing on a daily basis.There was no planning in recent years for the shocks and surprises to our economic cycle that were bound to happen. We could have planned in a much better way through investment in infrastructure, research and development, supporting the roll-out of broadband technology and improving communications generally. These are issues that were on the Government's agenda for many years and which could have given us a great opportunity to bed down in the economic cycle and the economy the edge Ireland needed and should have had to compete with the applicant countries of eastern Europe and beyond. We do  not need more commissions or reports to inform us that investment in infrastructure, along with the issues I mentioned, is required. We need action.Notwithstanding the costs to business, it is essential that workers receive improved social protection. This would have been more affordable some years ago had we planned for it in a better way. It is worth noting that we have the lowest expenditure of any of the European countries on training and redundancy. This social protection is something I support and I also, therefore, support the legislation.The Bill updates the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 to which there have been changes over the years, but this is a fundamental change to the level of remuneration and pay-out made under the Act. It is substantial, increasing the level from a half week's pay for each year of service to two weeks. It is a reasonable and prudent step forward for social protection for workers. The basic statutory redundancy payment to employees losing their jobs through redundancy resulting from closure, re-organisation or other grounds had not changed over the years. The purpose of the scheme was always to alleviate hardship for workers and their families in the event of redundancy and possible subsequent unemployment. A strong case has always been made for increasing the level of social protection as incomes have increased and the economy has improved. I am glad the Government task force report is finally being implemented.The current statutory redundancy payment should be amended to reflect not only the requirement for a higher payment for those who lose their jobs but also to reflect the vulnerability of those who lose their jobs at various stages in their careers. I welcome the calculation of service for redundancy purposes commencing at 16 years of age and that redundancy entitlements are payable after two years of employment. The enhanced payment of two weeks for each year of service is a reasonable and prudent step.The State should examine the desire of an employee to retrain with the necessary resources that will be made available through the redundancy payments scheme. Perhaps matching funds should be available to workers to help them attain the necessary qualifications to get back into the workforce as quickly as possible. FÁS could examine this option.The spirit of what was intended in the Government task force in respect of simplification of redundancy entitlements should be brought forward as quickly as possible. We should not have to wait another year for these provisions to be implemented. I also welcome the provision under which time off for maternity, adoptive, parental and carer's leave will be recognisable for statutory redundancy. I am especially glad the issue of carers was recognised in the calculation of the pay-out.Dozens of new houses have been built in the past ten years creating new suburbs in towns and  villages for working people. The tax and spend policies of and cost increases imposed by the Government place some families under financial pressure. We must reduce those pressures for young couples as much as possible. I hope the Minister will seek to have financial institutions, when lending money for private house mortgages, take out compulsory insurance to protect employees in the short term who are made redundant and give home owners, especially couples, breathing space for a minimum period, for example, six months. The trauma families must endure due to a loss of employment is enormous and it would be a great step forward if negotiations could be concluded with financial institutions to assist couples with their mortgage payments for a minimum period at a time of redundancy. The basis of a redundancy payments system is that when people lose their jobs, they and their families are able to sustain in the short-term the financial pressures that accrue from such an unexpected loss.The Minister, not surprisingly, mentioned the fact that she has met a number of workers' groups in recent months. Regrettably, she will probably meet many more in the next few months. She gave an undertaking on 12 December 2002 to workers in Comerama, Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, which is in my constituency. The company decided to cease trading and relocate some of its activities to other parts of the world, causing 180 workers to lose their jobs in north-east Kilkenny. The Minister indicated at the time that the partnership negotiations were ongoing and that any agreement reached on redundancy payments would be passed on to the workers in Castlecomer. These negotiations were concluded subsequently in the context of social partnership talks.There is no ambiguity about what the Minister said at the time.

I received a letter from SIPTU in recent days addressed to all Oireachtas Members representing County Kilkenny. It states:A Chara,We are writing to you as our Dáil representatives who attended the meeting . . .  as part of the delegation on Thursday, the 12th of December [at which] the Tánaiste, Ms Mary Harney, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment [was in attendance].You are all aware, as are the undersigned, that at our meeting the Tánaiste gave an unambiguous commitment that the Comerama work force would be included in any change in the then current formula for redundancy calculation.

That is my only quibble with the legislation, that the commencement order should be made from that date. If there is a will on the part of the Tánaiste and the Government it can be done and the Government's portion, at least, can be paid, notwithstanding what the Tánaiste had to say about the employer's contribution. The Government's contribution could be paid as an ex gratia payment if the Tánaiste has the will to do so.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	330	The Redundancy Payments Bill [Seanad] 2003 is in general to be welcomed as it is a substantial improvement on the current position. However, it comes too late for many workers who have lost their jobs particularly those who lost them over the past 18 months. As Deputy Hogan said, it is particularly disappointing for workers recently made redundant as there were clear indications from the Government and from the Tánaiste that the Bill would be retrospective. The Tánaiste now says she meant only if it were possible to do so. She now claims it is not legally possible. It is difficult to believe that such an experienced Minister who is also the Tánaiste did not know the real situation when she promised to make the Bill retrospective—

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I ask the Minister of State to allow the Deputy to continue.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	351	This was the start of an avalanche of closures and redundancies, many of which should not have taken place and would not be still taking place except for the total and utter mismanagement of the economy over the past five or six years.The two weeks per year of service proposed in the Bill is a minimalist approach but considering how badly the Government has managed the economy and as a result of the expected massive increase in redundancies, it is probably all the Exchequer can afford. Based on the redundancy figures for 2002 alone, this will cost the taxpayer €96 million. It will be interesting to see what the  real outturn of this estimate will be, considering the ever-increasing number of redundancies.Had the Government managed the boom and the economy well, it would have been possible to increase this figure as there would have been far fewer people looking for redundancy.The Government and in particular, the Tánaiste, must take responsibility for the massive job losses. Despite the statistics constantly quoted by the Government, the cause of the job losses is the increased cost of services to business. Since the budget there has been a constant flow of stealth taxes, increases in energy and transport costs. Inflation is out of control and industry can no longer tolerate the costs.The greatest scandal is the Government's inability to deal with insurance costs. The cost of employer's liability and public liability is causing a high rate of job losses. It is stifling the expansion hopes of existing businesses. It is nearly impossible for companies to get insurance. Despite the fact that the Minister has promised in this House to take action to deal with insurance, every employer's organisation is pointing out that jobs are being lost because of insurance costs. People do not want to be made redundant, they want jobs. The Government's inability to maintain jobs is a real problem.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	352	With the permission of the House I propose to share five minutes of my time with the Father of the House, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Pattison.Unless there is a compelling reason I find it unfortunate and discourteous to Members who have something to say directly to the Tánaiste today that she would come into the House for an important Bill that has been promised for a long time, deliver her own speech and not even wait for the first speech of the main Opposition party. It is particularly discourteous when she makes assertions that need to be addressed and cleared up during the course of the debate. I say that without any disrespect to the Minister of State who is present.This is an important Bill and it is belated. Those of us on the Labour benches have campaigned for a very considerable time to have the out-dated redundancy payments properly enhanced at a time when the social insurance fund was significantly in surplus, so much so that at the last opportunity the current Minister for Finance saw fit to raid it in order to augment general Government finances. It is set up for a particular purpose and that is to give security, help and support to workers.Workers who are faced with redundancy, the most appalling of issues, many after years of service, should be given some decent standard of support and remuneration to sustain them until they find gainful employment. It is quite clear for a considerable time that the meagre half week's pay per year of service for those under 41 years of age and one week's pay per year for those over 41 years was entirely inadequate. These standards  set in the 1960s were entirely inappropriate. Before the dissolution of the last Dáil, the Labour Party introduced a Bill to significantly increase the redundancy payments to such workers and to abolish age discrimination altogether.The Bill currently before the House addresses these issues to some extent. The increase is meagre enough and does not go as far as the three weeks we sought in our legislation. It settles for two weeks per year of service. Similarly, it addresses the age discrimination issue by abolishing that discrimination, which I welcome.A number of other issues have been touched on both in the Tánaiste's and Deputy Hogan's comments which improve and update the redundancy legislation. It makes it more efficient and the calculation of the redundancy period more discernible and easy. It also makes it easier for workers to have a clear calculation of their entitlements. I welcome also the calculation from the age of 16 in employment. I welcome these measures and, therefore, would say to the Tánaiste that we will give quick and speedy passage to the legislation, as agreed. We hope the deadline she stated in her declaration to the House this morning of ten days from now will met and that these benefits will be available to workers who are already facing the threat of redundancy in firms and industries throughout the country.The biggest deficiency in the legislation, however, is the abandonment of the clear promise of retrospection. Let us be clear about this. Workers involved in redundancies over the last year or so have been met by the Tánaiste and others. We have been discussing this issue since before the fall of the last Dáil. We were told then that negotiations on enhanced redundancy would form part of the new national deal and that independent legislation would not be published until that happened. We knew this was coming and those workers who were suddenly faced with redundancy wanted to be included in its provisions, including workers in Peerless Rugs in Athy and workers in Wexford Electronics in my home town. Many of these workers, after a lifetime of service to the company, were faced with nothing more than a meagre statutory redundancy.I want to deal clearly and factually with the issue in relation to the workers in Comerama, Castlecomer. The Tánaiste has made an issue of this situation. If she had simply stated from the beginning that she could not comply with the commitments she made, well and good, but to deny that she made a commitment flies in the face of the clear evidence of a number of people who attended that meeting. It is not good enough for the Tánaiste to circulate what she presents as a minute of that meeting to those of us who questioned her commitment or the actual words used. It is a minute prepared by her own staff, which was not cleared by anyone else present. To purport that it was an agreed minute is to misrepresent the facts. I have a written account pre pared by Mr. Mike Jennings, regional secretary of SIPTU for the midlands and the south east, on the background of the meeting and the commitments made by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. It reads as follows:On 12 December 2002 a large delegation of SIPTU representatives and politicians met Mary Harney and her officials to make representations arising from the closure of Comerama in Castlecomer.In response to written and oral requests made at the meeting Mary Harney gave an unusually clear and unambiguous promise to backdate the revised redundancy payments. She referred to the fact that improving redundancy was then being discussed by the social partners in the post-PPF talks. She clearly said that if the statutory entitlement is increased the due date would be set so as to accommodate the Comerama workers.The Comerama workers had already received their RP1s at that time. They were issued on 28 November 2002.Mary Harney could not have been in any doubt what it was she was being asked to do.Phil Funchion's (SIPTU branch secretary) written presentation given to the Tánaiste stated:". . . to ensure that any change in the current formula for redundancy calculation will include the Comerama workforce who received their RP1 forms with effect from 28th November 2002." [That was the submission.]The meeting of 12 December 2002 was attended by. . . Mike Jennings, Phil Funchion, Eamon Nolan, Anthony Barrett, Angela Byrne (all SIPTU), Liam Aylward TD, Phil Hogan TD, Seamus Pattison TD, John McGuinness TD, Senator Bernard Browne and Councillors John Brennan and Martin Carroll.Senator Bernard Browne should read Senator Fergal Browne. The briefing note continues as follows:Recognising that the Tánaiste's commitment was unusually explicit and unambiguous and therefore most valuable, I [this is Mike Jennings] took the trouble to double-check with Liam Aylward TD, John McGuinness TD and Seamus Pattison TD, that she had, in fact, said what I had heard her say. All three TDs [that is Deputies Liam Aylward, John McGuinness and Seamus Pattison] confirmed what I had heard.This meeting with these TDs took place on 15 January 2003 at a meeting in Castlecomer. Not only did [Minister] Liam Aylward confirm my recollection but he said that on 14 January 2003 he had contacted Ms Harney's office regarding it.Subsequent to that Deputy McGuinness circulated all the workers stating as follows:The Tánaiste gave a commitment in our meeting with her on the 12 December 02 to  ensure that the workforce of Comerama are included in any new deal which would be agreed. This is very positive news for those involved.That was a letter circulated to the workforce in Comerama on 20 January 2003 and signed by Deputy John McGuinness.I do not want to question the integrity of the Tánaiste but all these people have very firm recollections of the commitment made. If it is impossible to deliver on it for legal reasons, let that be acknowledged, but she should not fly in the face of the evidence of all those good people. The Tánaiste told the House on 8 May, and repeated this morning, that the unions were in no doubt that it could not be made retrospective legally. This makes a nonsense of the new version of what she told these people. Is she now saying she was giving an assurance that she would do her best to make it retrospective, if she already asserted that the unions knew it could not be done legally? Neither of her versions stand up. I regret greatly that she has taken this line.I want to deal with one or two other issues in the couple of minutes left. I hope the amendments I tabled will be accepted. I have tabled two amendments which I am now informed will be ruled out of order. I understand most of the amendments tabled by other Deputies who want to enhance redundancy payments, or make it retrospective, will also be out of order because we cannot impose a charge on the State. However, the Government can ensure that ex gratia payments are made to those workers who have been shielded in their preparations for redundancy with the thought that these enhanced payments would be made available to them. There is an onus and responsibility on the Government, particularly on the Tánaiste, to do so.The Tánaiste referred to the definition of redundancy. She said the Employment Appeals Tribunal, when dealing with redundancy cases, has long been of the view that redundancy is impersonal. She proposes to change the definition in section 5 of the Bill. I am concerned about that and I will deal with it in detail on Committee Stage. It is a narrow definition to provide that if redundancy is related personally to an individual, it is not redundancy. That is fine in the vast majority of cases. However, I wish to change it to read "the conduct of an individual". It could be a situation, for example, where somebody is made redundant on the basis of being last in and first out. That is personal to the individual concerned. I am fearful the provision would punch a hole in the definition of redundancy which would have a negative impact on some individuals in the future. I will deal with these points on Committee Stage.By and large, I welcome the Bill. It is urgently needed. Unfortunately, the upward spiral of unemployment has again become a feature of the economy. In all constituencies there are situations where people will face redundancy. I deprecate  the fact that at a time when supports were never more needed to assist in the retraining of workers to allow them to prepare themselves to re-enter the labour market speedily, those supports are being assaulted by the Government in a perverse type of pro-cyclical economic policy. In other words, when the money for retraining and supports is least needed, it is most available and when it is most needed, it is least available.The training supports for FÁS have been cut this year by 41%. Workers will need the additional resources they have in order to live but their chances of being properly retrained are severely curtailed by the savage cuts in the FÁS budget. The FÁS employment programmes have been cut by 12% and there has been the unconscionable attack on 5,000 places in the community employment scheme. It is a bizarre set of circumstances. The State invests in retraining, job creation, social employment and the other mechanisms that exist to ensure that people are not left unemployed for a lengthy period of time and these mechanisms are now under attack.Much more can be said about this Bill. I will not delay its passage but I deeply regret that the Tánaiste is not present to hear these points and to answer them. She has a fine and well earned reputation for being forthright and for confronting and answering any charges that might be made. She has done herself a disservice, hopefully for a very good reason, by absenting herself from this debate.

I welcome the Bill. It is long overdue and should be given a swift passage through the House. However, I have one serious reservation and in the limited time available to me I will focus on that.It concerns a definite commitment given by the Tánaiste to the deputation from Comerama, Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, which had a meeting with the Tánaiste on 12 December 2002. The meeting was held in the conference room of the Tánaiste's Department on Kildare Street. The deputation consisted of Oireachtas representatives from the constituency, local councillors, SIPTU officials, employees of Comerama and myself. We found the Tánaiste extremely helpful. She adopted a positive tone to the various points brought forward by the deputation and many useful suggestions and proposals were made. However, towards the end of the meeting the Tánaiste definitely made a commitment to include the Comerama workers in any new redundancy deal. I have no hesitation in putting that on record. There were no "ifs" or "buts" and it was not a question of doing her best or doing it if she could. It was a straightforward commitment to apply the terms of the new Redundancy Payments Bill to the Comerama workers.Last week in the House I was not merely surprised but shocked to hear the Tánaiste say she did not make such a commitment. I was not the only Member who was surprised and shocked. I  have never played politics in this House and I am not playing politics with this issue which is a straightforward one. Last week the Tánaiste attempted to justify her case by stating that she was at a meeting on the previous day with Mr. Jennings, who is a senior SIPTU official and was a member of the delegation, and he did not take up the issue with her. She inferred from this that he was in agreement with her statement.Nothing could be further from the factual position. That meeting involved a deputation from the then about to be made redundant workers from Tex Tech, Kilkenny, and reference was made to the new legislation in the context of the Tex Tech workers. It would have been totally inappropriate to raise the issue of the Comerama workers during a meeting with a deputation about another group of workers. To infer from this that he was in agreement with the Tánaiste is out of line. Deputy Hogan and Deputy Howlin have put on record some of the correspondence on this matter and I do not intend to repeat it. The Tánaiste further stated last week that when the recent negotiations were under way, the trade union movement was told that the legislation could not be retrospective. However, that is not the issue. The issue is that the Tánaiste now says she did not make a definite commitment when she did.There are many ways in which the Comerama workers can be compensated to the level of the new redundancy payments provided for in this legislation. Reference has been made to the famous or infamous, depending on one's point of view, Talbot agreement where an Estimate was introduced for a sum of £475,000 to cover compensation for those workers. There are also many ways in which ex gratia payments can be made.As a result of the outcome of the deputation's meeting with the Tánaiste last December and taking that commitment into account, the workers reached agreement with their employers on redundancy terms. It can be argued that the workers might not have accepted those terms and would have sought more favourable terms from the employers if they had any doubt as to the Tánaiste's commitment. I make an earnest appeal to the Tánaiste. She has the power, if not under the provisions of this Bill, to make ex gratia payments available. There are 160 workers involved. They paid their PAYE and contributions to the social insurance fund. She owes it, in justice, to them. A grave injustice will be done to these workers if they are not compensated in accordance with the commitment given by the Tánaiste.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I do not intend to be interrupted. I will behave like a Government Minister and not listen to anybody on the opposite benches. I wel come the Redundancy Payments Bill. It is urgently required because Government and employers' organisations have made every attempt to resist giving workers who are made redundant adequate compensation. This PD-Fianna Fáil Government has no desire to protect the rights and entitlements of the working class. Despite the wealth generated in the past ten years, life remains a perpetual struggle for the low paid workers of this State. James Larkin referred to William Martin Murphy as "the most foul and vicious blackguard that ever polluted any country. . . . a capitalistic vampire". If he were alive today, James Larkin would describe the current Minister for Finance in similar terms for it is Deputy McCreevy, through his political actions, who leads the lock-out against the workers of this State, preventing them from accessing the profits their labour generated during the years of the boom. Day in and day out we come here to argue on behalf of the people of the Twenty-six Counties for the services and benefits that are rightfully theirs. Relentlessly, we debate people's rights to housing, health care and education. We make these arguments in the knowledge that this Government is ideologically opposed to the delivery of these basic rights and is bringing public services in the State to their knees.Members of Fianna Fáil who spent yesterday morning at the State's 1916 commemoration would do well to reflect on the ideals advocated by the signatories of the proclamation of independence. In its governance of this State, Fianna Fáil has dishonoured such noble ideals. Many Fianna Fáil Ministers are disgraced by their conduct in Government and by their betrayal of the people's rights. Fianna Fáil backbenchers should rein Ministers in and stop them in their tracks. In fairness to the Progressive Democrats, they have never pretended to be anything other than Thatcherites.The workers of Peerless Rugs in Athy and the Irish Glass Bottle Company in Dublin deserve much of the credit for forcing this uncaring Government to reform the outdated redundancy legislation, the basic terms of which had not changed in 35 years. It is a sad indictment of this Government that it took the protracted disputes at Peerless Rugs and the Irish Glass Bottle Company, a profitable company which had refused to abide by a Labour Relations Court ruling of five weeks severance pay per year of service for each of the work force, and the determination of the workers of those and other companies to force the Tánaiste to introduce legislation to increase redundancy entitlements.The legislation was introduced following a commitment in the new agreement, Sustaining Progress. The Government and employers' organisations are increasingly forcing workers to bargain for rights that are already theirs as part of the wider social partnership deal. Employer recognition of unions, compliance with labour legislation and the fulfilment of statutory redun dancy rights are not concessions, they are all basic rights and should not have been up for negotiation in the first place.On behalf of Sinn Féin, I commend the large number of workers who protested in October against the inadequacy of redundancy compensation. We have supported those protests and support the workers on the ground, particularly in the Irish Glass Bottle Company in Ringsend.Though I welcome this Bill, it does not go far enough. I welcome the fact that discrimination suffered by young workers under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 is being abolished and the discrimination against older workers, whereby those over the retirement age are not entitled to statutory redundancy payments, is also being tackled. It does not go far enough, however, in addressing the level of statutory redundancy. Workers who have waited for this legislation for a long time are deeply disappointed that the Government has once again given in to pressure from employers' organisations to restrict the level of redundancy payment to two weeks per year of service. We support the demand made by the trade unions that the statutory redundancy payments be increased to three weeks' pay per year of service. I tabled an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage but it has been ruled out of order. I hope the Minister will accept the principle behind the amendment anyway.

The Tánaiste should be complimented for the speed with which she dealt with this issue.

It is refreshing, therefore, to see the efficient manner in which this legislation has been attended to. The swift progress no doubt occurred because the Tánaiste took a personal interest in this issue, having appreciated the seriousness of the situation for the workers who lost their jobs.This legislation has particular relevance in my constituency of Galway East. The shock announcement of the closure of Square D in Ballinasloe with the loss of 385 jobs was a major blow to the workers in the town. The Tánaiste is aware of the situation in Ballinasloe and is acquainted with some of the workers and their families. The Square D workers were concerned that this Bill will not cover them before the job losses take effect. The Minister of State should take this opportunity to confirm that the Square D  workers will come under the provisions of the Bill.It is good to know that this Bill will ensure that workers under 41 years of age, who heretofore would have qualified for half a week per year of service, will now qualify for two weeks' pay per year of service and that workers over 41 years of age, who heretofore would have qualified for one week's pay per year of service, will also qualify for two weeks' pay.Retrospection has been mentioned by many commentators and confusion reigns, with Fianna Fáil backbenchers issuing letters telling people that the provisions of the Bill will be retrospective while, at the same time, the Tánaiste has said this could not be done. The Tánaiste's speech this morning clarified this issue and while I regret that the provisions cannot be made retrospective, I welcome the legislation and compliment the Tánaiste and the Minister of State on the manner in which the situation has been dealt with.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I support this Bill as far as it goes but it does not go very far. I was amazed at the effulgent tributes paid by Senator O'Toole, a leading official of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to the Tánaiste in the Seanad because she introduced this Bill. The Senator went on at length, lionising the Tánaiste for moving from a situation where workers who are made redundant get some crumbs to giving them a crust of a little more substance. Let us get real about this. If we are talking about workers on low to medium incomes of around €400 per week, two weeks for every year would amount to €800 and after ten years they would be entitled, according to this Bill, to the princely sum of €8,000. This is supposed to be a massive advance for the working class of the State. I am afraid that the standards of leadership in the trade union movement are not very high at present if it is so welcoming of this legislation.There was no reference to the profits of the employing company from the labour of those workers in their previous years of employment. This issue arose in the case of the Irish Glass Bottle Company workers who were employees of a major multinational corporation. When they were let go with disgraceful redundancy terms, one of the workers said bitterly – but accurately – when referring to purchases of assets abroad by the company that all the money came from their labour and now the company was saying they could not have it and that hurt more than anything.There is no regard to the profits that have been salted away by some quite substantial companies when it comes to the level of redundancies that would be made available to those workers. The right to work is a fundamental human right in the view of the Socialist Party, involving a person's right to make a contribution to society, to have dignity and to earn an income that provides reasonable comfort for us all. It is a right that is not properly appreciated in the capitalist ethos  that dominates the present economic system. The protection and maintenance of employment should be the first priority of Government but unfortunately this Government has fallen down badly in this regard. There is a general problem of policy in the over-reliance of this Government on multinational corporations, which when it suits their profits will quickly disperse to far flung places where they may be able to source cheaper labour and leave Irish workers in the lurch. The Government is giving hostages to fortune in that regard and that is one danger for workers, particularly in the context of a new economic situation.Acting Chairman, can you ensure that I leave six minutes for Deputy Ryan?

I wrote to the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to the effect that the Government should have moved immediately to maintain the employment there by bringing together the local authorities, the Irish Glass Bottle Company workers and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This was an essential industry related to the recycling aims supposedly being advanced by this Government. That enterprise could have been taken into public ownership and run as a viable and thriving concern with the workers at the heart of its management, providing these essential services, in view of our imminent need to recycle glass. However, the Government would not even entertain the idea. It is blinded by its subservience to the ethos of the capitalist market and the domination of big business in every matter of life. Therefore, while we can support this Bill as far as it goes, it will not make up for the downfall of the Government in that and other matters.

I am certain that the media or others will comment on them. Maybe members of her coalition partners in Government might care to notify her as to the situation in the House. It is important as there is no Progressive Democrats member present. The Minister would surely want to address quickly the comments from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Pattison, which directly contradicted her earlier statement on the  commitment given to the Comerama workers. When I heard reports of the meeting I gave it a certain amount of latitude thinking that sometimes people have a hazy recollection and the trade unions' view might be somewhat coloured by their experience. To hear Deputy Pattison, the father of the House, be so categoric in his contradiction of the Minister leads me to advise the Progressive Democrats member, Deputy Grealish, who is coming back into the House, to alert the Minister to this issue. She may want to come back to this debate to address the matter that has been raised because it is a serious contradiction.

Like most speakers I am in favour of it. My party, however, has concerns about how the operation of redundancy payments is working, the lack of enforcement measures for certain companies which have not followed through on Labour Court redundancy settlements and the poor rating of workers in the creditors' listing in the redundancy situation. There are many serious issues around redundancy and unfortunately in the present situation of an economy which has been made less competitive by this Government's mismanagement, we will see increased redundancies in the next two or three years. This is going to be a serious issue.My main concern involves the number of weeks that is allowed. It would have been better had the legislation allowed for three weeks statutory redundancy rather than two as applied in the law. The Minister will say that is an easy argument for an Opposition spokesperson to put forward and that there are costs and other implications. To an extent, for proper long-term economic management we need to have a certain standard and way of dealing with workers and with how we view employment. The course that the Minister and her coalition partners are taking is not the correct economic path and their view of employment is largely geared to what the multinationals want from this country, rather than what we need.The Minister famously draws our attention to the choice between Boston or Berlin. She tends to espouse the Boston vision. She described it in the House recently as a one of extreme liberalisation which she believes will benefit our economy. It emphasises competition as a way of developing our economy. It derides State support or tries to reduce it as much as possible because the Minister believes, as do others with the same liberal economic agenda, that it interferes with the workings of business. We saw her only yesterday contradicting the European Union's desire to put some regulation on the chemical industry. That is a regular occurrence with this Government which is constantly trying to support businesses and not put in the regulation or supports that would make for a fairer, and in the long run, better economy.The comments about Senator O'Toole were interesting. His lavish praise of the Minister in regard to this Bill is probably due to the fact that it was more the social partnership system that brought the Bill through than any great impetus from the Government. That redundancy conditions have not changed in 35 years yet the country and the economy have changed so much, raises questions about why over the last five, ten or 15 years this has not been reviewed. Social partnership, in which Senator O'Toole is involved, is the real author of this Bill.The employment situation is changing. We no longer have the type of employment where someone stays in the same manufacturing service or company for 50 years and then goes into retirement and takes a pension. Our manufacturing base is diminishing rapidly and what remains is largely capital, rather than labour, intensive. We no longer have a large agricultural workforce. We are moving into a different economy in which long-term employment contracts do not exist. Instead there is contract work, short-term work and companies come and go quickly. In those circumstances one has to protect workers, set certain basic rights and set a tone which shows that employment is not just about getting the most out of the workers to try and boost the economy. It is necessary to have a balanced approach. The provision of a statutory redundancy of three weeks is a justified basic rate. I approve of the Bill but it does not go far enough. While supporting it my party is concerned about that element.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	371	Like everyone in the House, I welcome this timely legislation and appreciate the work of the Tánaiste, the Minister of State and the Department.It is important that we have this Bill before us, for, quite clearly, the fact that the world economy is in a continuing slump will have some effect on our economy. We have built a large proportion of our economic growth and progress on foreign direct investment, but unfortunately the shape of the world economy means that we can obviously be affected by an economic downturn. In such a climate, with so many multinational organisations providing employment here, sadly there will be job losses, and that is an unfortunate economic fact. The Tánaiste and the Department are currently doing all they can to minimise the level of redundancies and will continue to strive to replace any companies which fall by the wayside. However, in the meantime, we must accept that there will be job casualties, and this Bill represents a very pragmatic approach.I welcome the Bill because it provides for the implementation of enhanced redundancy pay ments and other improvements to the operation of the redundancy scheme. I wish it had been here some time ago. The changes were provided for under the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement and the report of the redundancy review group, which was set up by the Government in April 2000 to examine the operation of the statutory redundancy payments scheme to ensure that it met the needs not only of employees but employers in the best possible manner. I welcome the group's main recommendations and the fact that a simpler method for calculating service was part of it. Changes in the treatment of absences from work and different treatment of services abroad, the simplification of application forms and the new IT system, which will include an e-Government aspect, are things that we obviously welcome. The Bill encapsulates all those measures, as well as dealing with the extra commitments made under the Sustaining Progress agreement.I welcome the change to the Bill whereby those made redundant will now be able to claim two week's wages for every year served with a company on top of the bonus week. That payment is made regardless of age. As we are all aware, it was previously the case that those under 41 received half a week's pay per year served and those over that age a single week's pay. As well as raising the amount due to employees in the event of redundancy across the board, the legislation also removes the blatant age discrimination that exists under the current system.It is important to point out that, when the Government gave the go-ahead to draft this Bill earlier this year, the decision was also made to provide a sum of approximately €1 million to cover the cost of supporting information technology, administration costs and operational overheads through the support of the social insurance fund. Once the new IT system is in place, it will have a profound effect on the administration of the process. Not only will it make processing the various pieces of paperwork easier for the Government and the various agencies, it will make matters simpler for employers. When the new IT system is used in combination with the amalgamation into a single document of the three forms used as the main records of statutory redundancy – RP1, RP2 and RP3 – we can expect significant improvements in administrative efficiency. By allowing the process to be conducted by e-Government, we can also expect further significant economies in data entry costs. Last year the cost of the scheme's administration was approximately €1.3 million. With this Bill we hope and expect to see sizeable savings in that area.The Bill will also amend the legislation that currently deals with insolvency payments. As things stand, any employee of an insolvent firm who has not received statutory notice must take his or her case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to ascertain the minimum notice entitlement. However, under this Bill, if such a scenario  arose, employees would submit their claims directly to the liquidator-receiver without having to go to the tribunal. That will streamline the process and relieve the pressure on the Employment Appeals Tribunal, thus allowing it to deliver a better quality of service.

I say very bluntly that before I became a politician I was quite normal. I was made redundant three times in my life – not always, I might add, under Fianna Fáil Governments.

In the brief few seconds available to me, I strongly welcome and support the Bill. I congratulate the Tánaiste, her departmental officials and the Minister of State on bringing it to the House so quickly.It is important that we, as Members of this House, pass this legislation as quickly as possible. I hope that we will all work to ensure its enactment, for the legislation will give us a simpler and improved scheme that will be a great deal easier to operate and understand. It is fair enough that colleagues score political points, but ultimately it is a good Bill, and we should support it. Let us deal with all the issues and let the Minister understand that there is a PR job to do as far as communication is concerned. Even this morning I was still getting a large number of questions, and that is fair enough. Regarding another taunt made, I can say that I have not written loads of letters to companies in different constituencies. I represent Dublin South West, where there is a challenge as far as unemployment is concerned. The other day the Tánaiste told me in a Dáil reply that it was the second time in the space of a few months that  I had raised the issue of jobs. I will continue to do so for as long as I am here. Please God, I will never be made redundant. However, if I am, I will find another job to do in my community.

It is very important that we have legislation that protects the rights of workers in the event of redundancy. In my own constituency of Longford-Roscommon we have had a spate of redundancies in recent years. Unfortunately, not all of them will be covered by this legislation. I speak in particular of a matter which I previously raised in an adjournment debate: the position of the 30 workers from Roscommon Precision Castings Ltd. who were effectively locked out of their jobs in June 2001 and will not qualify for payment or support under this legislation. Their case should still be examined by the Department with a view to an ex gratia payment. Their rights, even under a Labour Court decision, have not been upheld, and the company has treated them badly. To date, the State has not seen fit to respond positively to them. I make a further call today to the State to have another look at their position to see whether an ex gratia payment can be made. What is the position with the employees of Square D, Ballinasloe, County Galway? While the company is not in the functional area of my constituency many of the workers live in Roscommon. Some 385 employees will be made redundant in June. Will these workers qualify under the new legislation?As regards jobs generally, even though the BMW region is supposed to attract 50% of all new jobs that is not happening. However, I do not have the exact figures. In recent months I have looked at job announcements and from what I can gather there has not been a redistribution of jobs into the BMW region. I repeat a call I made in January that further attention be given to the area that does not have Objective I status, that it be given the job entitlement it was supposed to receive  under the decision to develop the part of the country that was underdeveloped, that job creation be focused in that area and that increased grant aid be given to companies locating there. I call on the Tánaiste and the statutory agencies such as the IDA and Enterprise Ireland – sometimes I wonder what they do as I have not seen anything from them in my region recently – to focus more on that region.I welcome the legislation and compliment those involved. This is an important protection that is being put in place for workers and it shows the social partnership discussions can be broadened every time there is a new agreement. It is a positive step and I welcome it.
#EoinRyan	unknown-#EoinRyan-party	unknown-#EoinRyan-dob	unknown-#EoinRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I thank my colleague for sharing his time and allowing me to speak on this important and long overdue legislation which I welcome. In my constituency, the Irish Glass Bottle Company received a huge amount of publicity when it closed down through no fault of the workforce. It was a huge employer for a long period in Dublin's inner city. The workforce had dwindled over the years but the company still remained part and parcel of that area and its closure came as a shock to many people.In November there were protests outside the House about the closure and the redundancy package. At the time the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government promised to introduce legislation to deal with redundancy payments. They have kept that promise. I hear many people speak of broken promises, much of which is exaggerated, but the Government has kept its promise. This legislation, which is difficult and complex – one of the reasons it was not introduced by previous Governments – has been introduced in what is probably a record time. It allows for the greatest increase ever made in redundancy payments and has to be welcomed by all sides of the House. I am surprised people are nit-picking at it. When, through no fault of their own, people find themselves redundant they are very vulnerable and should be helped. I am pleased we are doing that. Unfortunately, for the legal reasons outlined, this Bill does not allow for retrospective payments. While I have listened to some Members in Kilkenny debate this issue, it was always made clear to me that retrospective payments would be impossible because the idea of having to pay redundancy retrospectively would open up a huge—

That is one of the reasons this legislation is difficult. It has to be welcomed. I congratulate all those involved in the Bill. I listened to Deputy Eamon Ryan earlier who spoke about Berlin and Boston. In the Seanad, Senator Joe O'Toole said "if this is Boston, we could do with some more of it". He will negotiate with anybody if it is good for workers. That is a very healthy attitude for any politician or trade unionist going into any negotiations.I welcome the legislation which is good and positive and will help people at a very vulnerable stage. In listening to the debate I heard Members say that job losses and inflation were out of control. That is not true. Inflation is not out of control; the rate is dropping. Every independent economist will testify to that. It is fine to criticise the Government – the Government should be criticised – but one must put forward one's own ideas. I have not heard any ideas coming from the Opposition. Do Deputies wish to follow the United States whose economy is in the doldrums as are the economies of France, Germany and Japan? We still have growth in our economy. By international standards we are doing well and we must continue that progress, consolidate what we have and move forward. These are difficult times in the international economy and we must recognise that. I am worried that we are talking ourselves into the doldrums. Everybody is saying there are massive cutbacks here and job losses there. We have to be more positive – there are not massive cutbacks, there are not massive job losses and inflation is not out of control.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Dowd. It was entertaining to listen to some of the comments of speakers on the other side of the House. This legislation is a response to the refusal by several firms, including the Irish Glass Bottle Company in Ringsend and Roscommon Precision Castings in Roscommon town, to make any attempt to abide by the Labour Court decision on redundancy payments arising from a number of judgments it has made. The decision put pressure on the Government to increase statutory redundancy rates.However, this legislation will not affect those who campaigned for this change, including the 30 employees in Roscommon Precision Castings. They will be left high and dry because the legislation is not retrospective. Other campaigners will also fail to benefit other workers, such as the employees of Square Deal in Ballinasloe and the hundreds of employees of multinational companies in Athlone, because redundancy notices will be issued prior to the enactment of this legislation.Many hundreds and thousands of jobs in small business around the country have been lost because for six years the Minister refused to deal with the spiralling cost of insurance, which has accelerated over the past two to two and a half years. As a result, many small businesses have closed or have laid off staff. This is especially prevalent in my own County Roscommon where small businesses have gone to the wall and have had to lay off employees. They are unemployed because of the lack of action by the Government. The Government compliments itself for introducing this legislation, which will increase statutory redundancy payments, yet it refuses to provide for the retrospection to which it had alluded on a number of previous occasions.Deputy Finneran considers that the workers of Roscommon Precision Castings have been badly treated and he has asked the Minister to reconsider the retrospection aspect. We will give the Deputy the opportunity to join us on Committee Stage in opposing section 17 of the Bill, which sets the date for the commencement order. Defeat of this section would enable the staff of Roscommon Precision Castings and Square Deal  and the employees made redundant in Athlone and from many small businesses in County Roscommon to benefit from the legislation.There has been much comment on what the Minster said when she visited Kilkenny. The most damning remarks were made by the former Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Father of the House, Deputy Pattison. No Member of the House would question the integrity of Deputy Pattison. I ask Deputies on the other side of the House to read what he had to say. He has made his views clear on the Minster's remarks and the question of retrospection.When the Bill was first published the commencement order was contained in section 1. However, because the Government backbenchers got cold feed and did not want to be embarrassed on the question of retrospection, the order was shifted to section 17. When the Bill was before the Seanad, a Fine Gael Party amendment on retrospective payments was allowed to be tabled but it has been ruled out of order in this House because of the fears of Government backbenchers. This is an indication of the view taken by the Government on this issue to those employees who campaigned for this legislation because their employers refused to abide by the Labour Court recommendation. They will lose out. While the provision allowing for a minimum of two weeks statutory redundancy pay is a positive step, it should be retrospective and should include those employees who have campaigned on this issue. It will not cover those employees who have already received redundancy notices, including those affected by the major job losses announced in County Roscommon and its hinterland.Deputy Eoin Ryan said inflation was falling. However, more jobs will be lost because of the rate of inflation, which is twice the European average. That has not changed in recent years. The Government can take no credit for the fall in inflation, which occurred because of external factors. Some 60% of the current rate of inflation is accounted for by decisions taken by the Government and its agencies over the past six to eight months, including the stealth taxes introduced by the Minister for Finance in the budget. If the Government is to take the credit for the fall in the rate of inflation it must address the stealth taxes it has imposed on ordinary people and workers.Deputy Finneran criticised the Minister and other State agencies for failing to meet the employment targets within the BMW region. The Deputy should realise that for the past six years he has been a member of one of the Government parties. There has been no increase in employment and no new investments have been announced in the BMW region. IDA Ireland has failed to meets its targets for the region and is not prepared to bring employment to it. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, wants the jobs to go to Cork and he could not give a damn about anyone in the BMW region. It is the same for every other Minister. The Ministers from the west  are, like the Minister, sitting on their hands on the question of employment and job losses. Not one of them will budge on the question of retrospection and allowing for increased redundancy payments to those former employees who fought for them arising from the intransigent failure by their employers to give them basic levels of redundancy payments.

The firm employs 76 people. A significant number of them worked at the factory for all of their lives. One man who telephoned me worked there for 30 years. They have a considerable commitment to the company, their community and their families. They asked that the redundancy package being offered to them be made under the terms of the Sustaining Progress programme accepted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 26 March 2003. These people were made redundant after the programme was signed by the Government and the unions. The response of the Minister was that on 26 April, liquidators acting for the company made a formal application on behalf of the employees. She said the application would be treated as a priority case, that every effort would be made to ensure that all eligible employees received their payments as soon as possible and that all payments would be tax free. She continued by saying that while every effort would be made to secure the successful passage of the Redundancy Payments Bill 2003 through the Oireachtas, it would not be applicable to the employees of this company.The issue is that workers who were part of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions agreed and accepted a pact which the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, signed off on also. They became redundant subsequently and the terms of this Bill should be made retrospective to include them. I understand from other Deputies that there are workers in other parts of the country who face the same significant problem. Under the old scheme, the gentleman who rang me in connection with this and who has 30 years service will receive €8,000. He would receive in excess of €20,000 if the new Bill were to apply to him. The workers believe that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible and has the power through this House and the Government majority to make this legislation retrospective.I understand that it cannot be made retrospective without limit, but these workers ask that it  be made retrospective to the date on which the agreement was signed. The agreement represents the commitment everybody made. I would like to see the trade unions campaigning more strongly on this issue. The deal was done at a national level among the Government and the social partners and there is no reason the trade unions should not insist the legislation be made retrospective. As the economy slows, times become more difficult for companies and inflation increases, more workers will become redundant through this Government's mismanagement. The fruits of the labours of workers who have given all their lives to a community should be recognised. If a Member of the Dáil is made redundant through the loss of his or her seat by the will of the electorate, he or she receives a generous redundancy package which no one here has complained about. The decision in such a case has been made by the public, rather than by a Minister. The system is fair in the context of the commitment people make to come here for so long.The same significant elements should apply to those who work in the community. The agreement was sacrosanct from the time it was made and it is a benchmark the Government could reasonably take on board. I cannot see why it would be open to challenge or why it should be challenged. The Government must be generous to the people who signed off on an agreement which was put to them. I would like the Minister to respond. The workers in Lissadell Towels, which is in the middle of nowhere, are faced with absolute ruin. The factory is between Ardee and Carrickmacross and it had a significant impact on the rural economy there. Its closure is a serious blow to everybody. The likelihood of the textile industry placing another factory at that location is remote. While there are social issues involved, there is a question of justice and fairness to be addressed also. I urge the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to think again about the matter.

The Progressive Democrats have always been a pro-work, pro-enterprise party and we have done more than any other party in this State to create the economic conditions needed to foster job creation. Over the last five years, PD-inspired policies have brought this country unprecedented success with almost 400,000 more people at work and a rate of unemployment reduced from 10% to just over 4%. In the last five months of this year, the Minister, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Industrial Development Authority have enjoyed tremendous success in attracting new jobs and investment to Ireland. To name but a few, at Baldoyle, Dublin, 380 new jobs have been created while Inamed in Arklow has added 200 new jobs to its existing work force. Accenture's European services centre in Dublin will see 150 new jobs and 350 new jobs have been created in my Galway constituency.In the first quarter of 2003, 3,096 new jobs have been created in 14 IDA supported ventures at a total combined investment which exceeds €220 million. Even Opposition Deputies must concede that this is a remarkable achievement, especially in the context of the changed economic climate and the general international slow down. These achievements are all the more remarkable in light of the stiff competition from overseas which the IDA faces in attempting to attract new investment. Unfortunately, there has also been a number of high profile job losses in the same period, most recently with the closure in Swords of Celestica. That blow was eased considerably by the speed with which replacement jobs were found and the announcement a fortnight later that Gerard Laboratories was to embark on a major expansion of its workforce.While as coalition partners in Government the Progressive Democrats will continue to work tirelessly to secure new jobs and investment, the dynamics of international economies mean that job losses are inevitable. Our continuing priority is to ensure that the rate of job creation continues to significantly outpace that of job loss. In addition to ensuring that workers who are made redundant are quickly able to secure alternative employment, we must ensure they receive an adequate financial provision to protect them in the immediate aftermath of losing their jobs. The Bill's provisions focus on this area.At present, workers of 41 years of age and above receive a week's pay per year of service if made redundant, while younger workers receive just half a week's pay per year. It has been accepted by all those who signed up to the sustaining progress partnership agreement and the report of the redundancy review group that the provisions are insignificant and must be increased. Once passed, this Bill will remove the age distinction and provide each worker made redundant with a statutory entitlement to two weeks' pay for every year of service. The existing provisions for the payment of an additional bonus week is being retained. Workers under 41 years  of age will receive a fourfold increase in their entitlement while those over 41 will receive twice their previous entitlement.I am fully supportive of this Bill which will give employees who were unfortunate enough to be made redundant a reasonable standard of statutory redundancy entitlements. It will give them financial support in the immediate aftermath of being made redundant. I welcome also the removal of the age distinction which the current legislation makes to penalise younger workers. The Bill will simplify the operation of the scheme governing redundancy payments to make it speedier and more effective. This should not be overlooked. Simpler methods of calculating service, simplification of application forms and a new IT system, including an e-Government aspect, are to be introduced. The Bill will provide for a better redundancy payments scheme which will be easier to operate and understand.The Opposition has tried to score cheap political points in the House by attacking the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for allegedly breaking her word. I have the privilege of being the Tánaiste's colleague and I can state categorically that she does not break her word. She promised those workers whom she met that she would do her best to increase payments applied to them. However, this has not proved possible and the legal advice available to the Government is clear that obligations such as increased statutory redundancy cannot be assigned to employers retrospectively.It appears there is case law to back up the Tánaiste's stance on retrospection. This entire scenario was played out about 20 years ago in the courts when Nokia Ireland took a case against the then Minister for Labour who was attempting to apply recently introduced redundancy legislation retrospectively. The Bill sought to make more generous redundancy payments and the company went to the employment appeals tribunal opposing the move. Their position, that it should not be made retrospective, was upheld. The State appealed the ruling to the High Court, but Mr. Justice Declan Costello ruled that one cannot constitutionally impose an obligation on to a company or an individual retrospectively.

As the Tánaiste pointed out, the Labour Party clearly did not regard the protection of redundant workers as a priority when it was in power and failed to introduce a Bill of this nature. The level of payments had not changed, except for the ceiling on the weekly wage, since the redundancy scheme came into operation in 1968.The pace with which the Bill has been brought to the House has been remarkable and I pay tribute to the Tánaiste and her Department for it. The drafting of the Bill was approved by the  Government in February and the text was approved on 30 April. It was published on 7 May, is before the House today and will come into effect on Sunday 25 May. The best option available to Opposition Deputies is to fully support the Bill. They did not bother to introduce such a measure themselves and it is cheap politics for them to try and score points by criticising its provisions.

#DanWallace	unknown-#DanWallace-party	unknown-#DanWallace-dob	unknown-#DanWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I congratulate the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, for bringing the Bill before the House. I welcome the Bill and acknowledge its importance for employees who are unlucky enough to lose their jobs through redundancy. In employment terms, the last few years have been a time of growth and great security for most employees. However, even if these boom times continue for the foreseeable future, we must be mindful of providing properly for those who will unfortunately be made redundant. For many people, losing a job can be as traumatic as the death of a close relative. The sense of loss is immense and the resultant financial hardship often leads to other problems for the individual employee and those close to them.The increased lump sum payments proposed in the Bill will help to alleviate the financial hardship caused by redundancy. Under this Bill, employees who are issued with notices of redundancy will be entitled to two weeks pay for each year of service plus a bonus week. This is a significant enhancement of the current redundancy provisions. The changes have been well thought out and have come about following the establishment by the Government of a review group in the context of social partnership. This review group, having examined the operation of the statutory redundancy payments scheme, agreed a range of changes to it and this Bill will give effect to some of these changes.The Government has also agreed to amend the Protection of Employees Acts 1994 – 2001, to enable employees of insolvent companies to make claims for minimum notice entitlements under the insolvency payments scheme without having to obtain an award from the employment appeals tribunal. This provision in the Bill is a significant safeguard for employees and must be welcomed. I am sure most Members have had occasions when constituents have approached them with the difficulties and delays and the associated trauma they have had in relation to having to go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.The review group also recommended an IT system to improve the efficiency of the service. The Minister proposes to spend €1 million to cater for  the administrative implications of implementing the full range of changes set out in the Bill. This new system will simplify administration, especially for employers, and will bring about improved efficiency in administration by the Department.In her speech to the House, the Minister confirmed that this Bill cannot be retrospective. I regret that this is the case but accept the reasons as outlined by the Minister. The protections for employees and improved financial provisions should be made available to all employees as soon as possible and there is an onus on the House to deal with the Bill as a matter of urgency so the Minister can proceed to sign the ministerial order giving effect to the new redundancy Act. I acknowledge the Minister's comments paying tribute to the Opposition, particularly the spokespersons, for their co-operation in this regard.We have often discussed at length the merits of social partnership and how beneficial is has been for employers, employees and the economy. In the negotiations for Sustaining Progress, all social partners reached an agreement to increase the level of statutory redundancy payments. The introduction of this Bill shows further the ability of the social partners to reach consensus and influence social policy for the benefit of their members. It is a further evidence of the strength of the social partnership process.When the improved statutory redundancy payments come into operation, it is likely to cost the Exchequer an additional €96 million, based on the 2002 levels of redundancy of 24,000. The improved financial provisions will provide some consolation to people at a vulnerable and often traumatic time in their lives. However, while the increased payments will ease the financial burden on a short-term basis, the priority must be for all of us to ensure that we continue to maintain the climate where the economy will prosper and employment opportunities will be readily available for those who wish to avail of them. This, more than anything else, will minimise the effects of redundancy on society and those affected by it. I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Government for bringing it before the House.

In some instances, we are blamed for being lethargic and dragging our feet but this Bill has come through swiftly. It is a milestone Bill, which updates an Act that goes back 35 years. When that Act was first introduced it was also an historic Bill.The Bill eliminates an anomaly whereby, under the old Act there was discrimination. If one was under the age of 41 and over 16, one was entitled to a half week per year of service and, if one was over 41, that rose to one week. I am glad that anomaly has been wiped off the Statute Book. The Bill also increases the statutory minimum  limit to two weeks and it applies across the board from the age of 16 through all years of service, irrespective of age.I listened to some of the adverse comments made. Some Deputies were using parochial instances of factories that closed in their own areas or companies that laid people off. That is a sad situation but Ireland is close to zero unemployment, which is a substantial record. If we take the heart of Europe, Germany – one of the big countries – has some 11% unemployment. It is a frightening statistic and we have done well in that regard.The negative comments remind me of a woman who came to west Cork in the early 1950s called Mrs. Kitchener, who wrote a book which was a satire on the poor people of west Cork called "Summer in Another World". I wonder if the Deputies are referring to another world. I was in west Cork last week, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, visited some fish factories, all of which are doing excellent work. Many of them could not operate were it not for the fact that they have Latvian, Lithuanian and Russian workers. Nearly 25% of the nurses in Bantry hospital in west Cork are Filipinos. Our doctors are mostly either North Africans or Asians. They are most welcome there, but they represent a problem: on one hand, we are bringing in thousands of people not only from the EU but from beyond and giving them gainful employment, while on the other hand we are worried about unemployment. Long may this situation last.I was reminiscing recently about a great book by Mrs. Kitchener which was read by many people before my time. It was a satire on the less well off of west Cork in the 1950s, who had few facilities.

#DennisODonovan	unknown-#DennisODonovan-party	unknown-#DennisODonovan-dob	unknown-#DennisODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	418	It is positive news. We do not have the luxury of the Luas, nor any national primary routes, but we do have some salient features.We all criticise multinational companies that come and go but to be fair, the vast majority of the companies I have studied, when they leave our shores and make people redundant, pay well above the statutory rate of redundancy payment that has been there for many years. I am subject to correction, but that is my view. When Gulf Oil pulled out of Bantry in about 1980, it paid about six times the statutory rate. That was welcome.I came across a chap this morning who has been working for 11 years in a temporary capacity for a particular Department. He has not been made permanent. Are these temporary workers covered under this legislation? Also, are part-time workers covered? In my own business, many of the staff job-share, particularly young married women, working perhaps three days per week or one week on, one week off. In essence, this is a positive Bill. It is important to note that it has been welcomed from all sides of the House.I have studied closely the requests from some of the Opposition spokespersons and speakers for this legislation to be made retrospective. I would have no problem with that if it could be done, but the Attorney General has advised the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that this is not possible. If it was to be done, where would we draw the line? Do we go back to 1 January 2003 or 1 January 2002? What about people who were made redundant in 1999? However far it is rolled back, some people will feel they are left out. If it can be done, it would be welcome, but I have great reservations. Many people have been in the House much longer than I have, but from what I can see it has not been established that it is possible to make matters such as this apply retrospectively. I am acutely aware of the position in which the Minister and the Government find themselves. It is an issue over which they have no control. They are obliged to stick rigidly to the fact that legislation cannot in most instances be made retrospective.I am delighted to welcome this Bill and I compliment the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on her foresight in this regard. I also compliment my Cork colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, on the great work he is doing.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I wish to share my time with Deputies Neville, Crawford and Ó Caoláin. I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking on  this Bill. There is nobody in the House who does not welcome it – we have been waiting for it for a long time. I also compliment our spokesperson, Deputy Hogan, on his speech.It is disappointing when a commitment is given by a Minister and backbenchers of the Government to workers who have already suffered the loss of their jobs and that promise is not kept. I say to the Government, the Minister and the Department that this is an outrageous attack on people who have already lost their jobs, who agreed to take redundancy because they thought that when this Bill was passed in the Dáil they would be included among the beneficiaries of the new redundancy payments.It is time this Bill was passed. I recently had a man in my office who had worked for a company for 29 years. After 29 years of work, he was given a redundancy payment of €8,000. He worked loyally for that company for 29 years, but that is what he got from the State. This case will be before the courts tomorrow so that he can get the company's portion of the payment.The previous speaker talked about jobs. I welcome jobs anywhere, but when one hears small announcements of 29 jobs, one should watch out. I predict that tomorrow or the next day bad news will come from the Department. I assure Deputies this is what it does. It sends out a press release saying that this or that company will create five, ten or 20 new jobs. These jobs never arrive. All that happens is that the company gets grant aid from the Department. The following day, there is bad news from the Department.In 1997, when Fine Gael were in Government with the Labour Party, more than 1,000 jobs a week were being created. Now, about 800 jobs are lost per week. I have listened for the past five years to that side of the House telling us the wonderful job the Government has done with the economy and how great the economy was going. They were prepared to take the credit when jobs were being created, so they should now take the blame when jobs are being lost. This Government must take a great deal of the blame. Small business and industries cannot survive any longer with the kinds of charges that are coming down the tracks. No matter what one gives the local authorities now, they are still not satisfied. The Government may think that small businesses can subsidise local authorities, but that day is long gone. It is time the National Chamber of Commerce took the issue of rates to court. Why should one section of society have to pay rates, while nobody else does? This double taxation is creating great problems in the workforce.If the Government still thinks that at every opportunity it should create further taxes for employers, it is wrong. It will not work. I listen to small businesses every single day. They are sick and tired of being the soft touch for further taxation. They pay rates and then they get a separate bill for the water supply and another for refuse collection. Then they have to contend with the  famous inspectors from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, from the Department of Health and Children and from the council. These are jobs for the boys and girls of this State, being paid for by the people who are trying to create employment. The other day I was at my clinic in a hotel. The owner came out to me with a 15-page report from an official of the health board. Fifteen pages – the official must have spent the full week drawing up the report. This man had spent nearly €0.75 million on his business. He said he was sick and tired of this and threw down the report. He employs 70 people and every single day he is attacked by the State. He is an employer, with people working for him, and he is sick and tired of these bureaucrats – he used another word, but I will not put it on the record of the House – coming in and telling him how to run his business.

The State has an obligation to look after these people. They have worked hard and paid their taxes. It is outrageous that the man I mentioned earlier, who worked for a company for 29 years, is getting a payment of €8,000. The Government should look at another way to honour the promise it made to the people in, for example, a company in Kilkenny. If it cannot do it through this legislation, there should be another one-off payment to these workers, and it should happen soon.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It should have been introduced many years ago, but nevertheless it is more than welcome to see an improvement in the level of redundancy payments. The increase in the statutory payments has been long overdue. I never understood why the principal Act provided only for a half-week's pay for each year of service for people under the age of 41.I want to deal with a number of points regarding redundancy. I should record my experience in this area. I was a personnel manager for 15 years and was involved in quite a number of redundancies. I then was made redundant and subsequently spent nine years on the Employment Appeals Tribunal adjudicating on issues, including the redundancy Acts.Sometimes people interpret redundancy as being a way in which an employee can get at his or her employers. However, in most cases, 90% of cases, it is necessary for the survival of the organisation and the protection of the jobs of the remaining employees. Companies move on and  must keep up with efficiencies created by mechanical or other means. If a company does not keep up with those improvements, it loses competitiveness, goes out of business and the employer will be responsible for not ensuring the efficiency of his or her organisation and for not ensuring that redundancies took place at the appropriate time in order to maintain the efficiency of the organisation. In most circumstances an employer has a responsibility to ensure that his or her corporation is performing efficiently for the benefit and security of the workers. In the case of liquidation, the company would have gone out of business and redundancy becomes inevitable.There is also the other side of the coin, that of the experience of being made redundant. It is a unique, difficult and shattering experience. Employees are sometimes aware of changes and may expect to hear news of redundancy, but people are always in shock and find it traumatic when they are informed that they will be made redundant. They go into denial. Being made redundant is almost like a death in the family. People suffer similar symptoms and experiences. They go through a phase of arguing, fighting and trying to persuade their employer that the redundancies are not necessary. They often get depressed and finally they accept the position and move on. This is a difficult experience for an individual.I have had the difficult job of having to tell good, loyal employees that they no longer had a job. I have sat with people often for an hour and talked matters through with them while they began to take in the news. It is amazing how people can move on from hearing such news. I remember telling a person she was being made redundant and she was extremely shocked and depressed on hearing that news. However, within three days I was able to reverse that decision as a result of another employee opting to take voluntary redundancy. When I brought that person in and tried to persuade her to stay with the organisation, she had moved on to such an extent that she wanted me to withdraw the offer, but I persuaded her to accept it. That was almost 20 years ago and that person is still working in the organisation.The unions have been good in negotiating redundancies and good packages have been given through the Labour Court. This Bill is necessary to provide for the vulnerable sole trader or employer employing one, two or three people. While the employer will honour his or her statutory requirements, an employee has no power to negotiate a reasonable package. The package provided under this legislation is even on the low side in terms of the compensation a person should get on being made redundant having worked in a job for five, ten, 15 or 20 years. I joined an organisation on leaving school and had worked there for 23 years when I was made redundant.I welcome the Bill. I would like to have had more time to develop those themes and I tried to cover as much as I could in the time available.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I also welcome this legislation. It is a measure I and many other Deputies have sought for some time to have introduced in light of factory closures in our own areas and from being aware of the difficulties with which workers who were made redundant have had to deal to get the necessary funds to meet their mortgage repayments in order to retain their homes. I can think of Teradyne workers in Cavan, Wellmans, CPV and Lissadell Towels who have lost out having regard to the Minister's speech today.I remind the Minister of State that fund was raided by the Minister for Finance last December. I urge the Minister and the Government to re-examine the issue of backdating payments. There are precedents for doing so. When the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced the increase in the compensation payment for reactor animals in May of the year concerned, those payments were backdated to 1 January. When that did not meet the requirements of some people, it was backdated to when herds were closed on 1 January. Therefore, there is a precedent for the backdating of payments. This issue needs to be examined bearing in mind that factory owners and workers were desperately clinging to the day when this legislation would be brought into force. While I fully understand the comments made by Deputy Pattison, Deputy Hogan and others about commitments made by the Minister that should be honoured, there is a wider spectrum in this regard. A means should be found to at least backdate these payments to 1 January for those persons concerned.Small industries are under a good deal of pressure. Given the small number of jobs in those industries, workers in them can lose out much more than workers in larger industries. From that point of view, I welcome the provisions in the Bill. If the Minister is slow to bring in changes and regulations to deal with increasing insurance costs, this redundancy package will be important. We do not want any more public relations exercises or promises; we want real action taken to deal with this issue.I was assured this time 12 months ago that if a certain Government got elected, the insurance issue would be sorted out the next day. We have now been told that Bills in that regard that were to come before this House will not come before it for some time. As the Minister has taken responsibility for dealing with the insurance issue, I ask her to make it a priority in order to ensure that small industries and others who must deal with this issue are not forced out of business. The furniture industry, the mushroom industry and several others are high risk sectors in some areas. If the insurance issue is not dealt with, they will be forced out of business.As far as I am aware the Minister has not visited Clones in her capacity as Minister, yet Clones is one of the hardest hit Border towns. If she is to be a Minister for all the people, areas such as Clones must be seen to. The CPV plant has been closed, although we hope that it will reopen, but  it will not reopen without some genuine help. The Minister visited Lough Egish a few years ago and promised the delegation there that she would examine the possibility of putting in place a tax structure for food production in that area, but nothing has happened in that regard. Buildings are lying idle there, which could have been used to help to save unnecessary redundancy packages.In Monaghan town, Monaghan Poultry, McCaldin's Bakery, Patton's Mill, Montex are among the factories that have been closed over the years. The Minister has a legal obligation to make sure that all people in this country are treated equally. Under the Good Friday Agreement an effort should be made to ensure that jobs are created in those areas. If the euro-sterling relationship changes, the benefits we have obtained from cross-Border trade will have major effects on towns in the Border area. We need to look at creating employment to ensure there is somewhere for young people to find jobs and work.

Will the Minister of State advise how quickly will the legislation come into effect?I share the concern of many that some redundancies forced on workers in different situations have been introduced ahead of the legislation to avoid its effects and having to pay levels of redundancy payments that I regard as fair and reasonable and which are provided for in the Bill. This needs to be examined because it is a serious charge and I do not make it lightly. Some managers judged that, if redundancies were to be faced later in the year, it would be more cost-effective to bring them forward and have them put into effect in advance of the legislation being passed. That is a disgrace if it is the case and can be proved.The current level of redundancy payments at a half week's pay per year of service is, as we have acknowledged, derisory and the Bill proposes to change the level to two weeks' pay per year of service. It should go further, and my colleague, Deputy Morgan, had tabled amendments to that effect. This is an issue that should have been allowed to be debated to give it an airing and full exploration because there is a sustainable argument that the level should have been increased to three weeks.Also, the legislation should have been retrospectively applied. I have listened carefully to all the responses from the Government and its claims that it could not introduce retrospection. What evidence is there of whatever effort has been employed in pursuing that course or option? What options were examined? Were there other imaginative means that would have allowed for a  retrospective application of the terms of the Bill? Perhaps the Minister of State would address those concerns.As Deputy Crawford said, people in our constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, while welcoming the Bill, are conscious of the many workers who have lost out on benefiting under its terms. The Deputy instanced and named a number of them, especially the workers in Lissadell in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, a long-standing employer which laid off 60 workers and whose factory is now closed. I have real concern in that case and have no doubt that there are others within the constituency who share the concerns already expressed by the previous speaker.The workers in Lissadell and others have been forced to accept what I regard as a derisory half-week per year of service statutory redundancy. They have looked to the House and the elected Members at this level to seek redress and address of the deficiency in the existing provision and an increase in redundancy payments as signalled. They and thousands like them are not being catered for and their bitter disappointment will continue.I wish to raise the case of the workers made redundant at Richardsons, the Irish Fertilisers Industry's plant in Belfast. IFI was a company owned by this State. The Belfast workers had a redundancy agreement and, when the company was wound up, it was not honoured by the Government of which the Minister of State is part. As a result, the workers have been left short and out of pocket.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	435	It is ironic to speak on the Bill when it will hardly make the headlines of the newspapers and television news, yet the changes we are discussing and making will have a major  impact on many people over the next few years. Deputy Ó Caoláin referred in his contribution to the fact that we will face more redundancies. It is those people who, unfortunately, will be made redundant in future who will benefit from what we are doing here today.One of the reasons there will always be a growing number of redundancies is that there are more workers. The work force is larger than ever before. Another reason is the changing nature of employment through advances in technology and so forth. While the total figures may fluctuate marginally at a given point, there can still be many redundancies within the economy.I was talking casually to someone about the Bill and its relevancy to redundancies. They said it was great that the payment would be increased significantly and that they would have a lump sum to go on holiday or whatever. Redundancy payments are for a different purpose. Statutory redundancy is a compensation for people.The system in place, which pays a half week or a week depending on age, is 36 years old, having been introduced in 1967. The economy and our lifestyles have changed significantly since then. In 1967, when I was a young fellow, we did not have a car and did not go on foreign holidays. My mother and father had few debts except the mortgage on the house. Lifestyles today are quite different. People are prepared to buy on hire purchase or lease and so forth.The purpose of statutory redundancy is to compensate people adequately for a period to give them an opportunity, if they are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs, to re-organise their lives without getting into serious debt. It is appropriate that the level has been increased to two weeks per annum. It is important that, when people receive this lump sum, as will inevitably happen as we go forward, they look on it in those terms. It is important the money they receive is used to meet their financial commitments at that time.We live in an era when people have financial commitments other than their mortgages. It is important that they realise we are giving them an opportunity to readjust and find employment without going under and getting into serious debt. That is one of the major problems of which the public must be aware. Statutory redundancy is not a holiday fund.I compliment the Minister on what appears to be the speedy manner in which the Bill has been brought before the House. I read some of the comments of Senator O'Toole when he referred to meeting the workers from the Irish Glass Bottle Company last November at which he said he would make this an issue with the Government on their behalf. He referred to his dealings with the Minister and so on.It is now May, six months on, and a great deal of work has been done by the Minister and her Department in producing the Bill and obtaining the agreement of her colleagues to have it brought before the House. It is my understanding  that, when it is passed, the Bill will become effective very quickly, and that is important. If the point made by Deputy Ó Caoláin in relation to companies being opportunistic and making early redundancies is true, then that needs to be investigated and made public. It is equally important that this Bill becomes effective immediately so as not to increase that opportunity or to afford time to others to engage in that type of practice.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I am grateful for the opportunity to share time in this important debate. I join with the other speakers who have welcomed this very worthwhile Bill. At a time when there is clearly an increase in the number of workers being made redundant, many people who find themselves in that position will welcome this legislation and the benefits it will bring.The proposed changes will benefit those in the community who have lost their employment through redundancy. Many of the traditional industries in Ireland that provided steady employment in the past are now finding the chill winds of competition quite difficult to deal with.In the past in my area of the north-east, thousands of people were employed in traditional industries such as footwear and textiles. Unfortunately, the footwear industry is long gone and is part of the industrial history of the area and the textile industry is following suit.In the last number of weeks, Lissadell Towels, an industry which was based on the Louth-Monaghan border between Ardee and Carrickmacross, closed its doors. Lissadell Towels provided good and steady employment for many people over a long period of time. The plant survived many ups and downs and displayed a resilience and a staying power which owed much to the loyalty and flexibility of its workforce. The staff are drawn from three counties, west Louth, south Monaghan and north Meath. Many of the employees spent all their working lives in Lissadell and are now devastated by the closure of the plant. New houses were built and families were reared as a result of employment in Lissadell but, sadly, the plant is no more.Those made redundant are of an age where re-training is particularly difficult. It will not be easy for them and it is to be hoped that as many as possible will be able to avail of re-training facilities provided by FÁS. Employees are saddened and disillusioned with the demise of the local industry.The news of the Redundancy Payments Bill 2003 created hope that there would be increased payments to soften the blow of unemployment. Redundancies were made in Lissadell just a few weeks prior to the Bill being circulated and there was clearly an expectation among the former employees of Lissadell that they would benefit from the increased payments. It goes without saying that being made redundant on 20 April 2003 is no different to being made redundant on 20 June 2003.The Tánaiste spoke about the difficulties with retrospection. I appeal to her to have regard to the circumstances of the employees in Lissadell and those in other industries that have closed recently. These employees must now feel very embittered that they may well lose out on the increased payments. I ask her to consider the position within the context of this legislation or of other amended legislation.Many of those who have been made redundant, particularly in the textile sector, will find it extremely difficult to find alternative employment. They have mortgages to pay and families to support and all the weekly domestic financial outgoings that everybody has to meet. It is difficult enough to do that on a low or medium income in normal times but being made redundant clearly increases the burden and the responsibility in those circumstances.I appeal to the Tánaiste and to her Department to consider the implications. I know it is a question of where retrospection begins and ends, more particularly where it begins. This legislation is part of the partnership agreement and the expectation about it has existed for some time. It may well be that some industries may have been able to hold on while others in different circumstances have been unable to do so, but a transition period exists which bears sympathetic examination to see what can be done to accommodate or at least ease the blow for those who have become unemployed during the transitional phase.

She carries a fair bit of the responsibility for the unemployment situation in Donegal. This Bill may pertain more to Donegal than any other part of the island given the job losses over the past six months and even long before that. Sadly, there is no sign of a change in the trend.Unemployment figures for Donegal are running some 10% higher than the national average. I want to say to the Tánaiste and the Government that we are in crisis and cannot take any more in Donegal. Something must be done. Over the past five years we have had unemployment levels of between three to five times the national average. It is not just today or yesterday that the job crisis began in Donegal.A task force was set up four years ago and it was intended to spend €598 million on job creation in Donegal but nothing has happened. I would like to know where the money and the jobs have gone. From what I can see, these jobs have gone to every other county but Donegal has been neglected for some reason. I do not like saying that to a member of a Government whom I have supported this far. The only thing achieved by the task force in Donegal was to take the heat out of the redundancies in Fruit of the Loom.Unifi in Donegal are letting 250 jobs go on a phased basis from the end of this month until the end of July. While I welcome this legislation, I want to ensure that these employees are dealt with under the terms of this Bill. I wrote to the Tánaiste two weeks ago inviting her to visit the county. While I appreciate her reply, I and many others are urgently awaiting a date for her visit as we need assurances that the other 420 jobs in Letterkenny are secure. We need to know the position on job security at Donegal Healthcare and other smaller industries in Letterkenny and in the county as a whole.We no longer accept the excuse that Donegal is inaccessible; we are no more or less accessible than some other counties. The Tánaiste knows better than I do about the job losses in Donegal, whether in Fruit of the Loom or the industrial estate in Gweedore which now lies empty. Unifi and many other smaller industries have gone to the wall.There are a large number of small farmers in Donegal and they are going through hard times at present. Many have left farming and more will follow. The conditions laid down by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, restricting the number of days on which fishermen can fish, has badly affected Donegal.It is not my intention to attack the Tánaiste but these facts need to be outlined. The time has come when we in Donegal must shout "stop". We cannot sustain any more losses. We must try to bring the unemployment figures in Donegal back to the national average.I look forward to the opportunity of meeting the Tánaiste in Donegal in the near future and discussing the issue in depth. It is time to provide sustainable employment in Donegal.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I wish to share my time with Deputies Timmins and Wall.This Bill is too little too late. While any improvement in statutory redundancy terms is to be welcomed, what is on offer in this Bill is not good enough. The Labour Party will support the rapid passage of the Bill through the House because to do so will be in the best interests of the hundreds of workers who urgently need improvement in the statutory redundancy terms. Let us not pretend, however, that this measure is anything like a decent or enlightened piece of legislation.The Labour Party has been campaigning for years for an improvement in statutory redundancy payments. In our election manifesto we called for redundancy payments to be increased to at least three weeks' pay per year of service, with the removal of restrictions on the basis of age. The trade union movement made the same demand and was backed up by thousands of workers who took to the streets on 4 October last. At that stage the need for reform was more obvious and urgent than ever. Through the gross mismanagement of the economy by the Fianna  Fáil-PD Government, there has been a constant flow of redundancies. In fact, the total number of redundancies doubled in 2002 compared to the previous year and we are continuing to see major job losses on a weekly basis. These workers do not need a load of waffle from the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach about the international downturn. They need reasonable redundancy terms and some prospect of finding work. The same Ministers who were so ready to take the credit for job announcements during the boom have nothing to say to workers facing redundancy.This Bill represents the very least the Government could get away with without collapsing the social partnership talks. It is extracted grudgingly and belatedly from a Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment whose dedication to the IBEC agenda is above and beyond the call of duty. The Bill is grounded in meanness and a basic lack of compassion for those who find themselves without work, and a concern only for the interests of big business and the corporate sector. I only mention "compassion" because it is lacking. Statutory payments are not a matter of compassion or charity.We are talking about workers who have paid PRSI payments in some cases for decades. They have made their contributions to the social insurance fund and it is only reasonable that they should be entitled to a decent payment when they lose their jobs. It is supposed to be an insurance scheme where one pays in and gets something decent in return. However, we all know the Tánaiste does not hold this view of insurance. Otherwise, she would not tolerate the organised test, which is the current Irish insurance market. She has had responsibility for this industry for the past six years. It is not as if the State cannot afford to provide for decent statutory redundancy payments. The surplus in the social insurance fund at the end of 2002 was €0.25 billion. The projected surplus at the end of 2003 is €1.5 billion in spite of the Minister for Finance's raid last year of the sizeable sum of €635 million from the social insurance fund.I want to put on record my abhorrence at the way in which the Tánaiste has dealt with the issue of retrospection. She accused my party leader last week of playing politics with vulnerable people. This morning and throughout the debate on the Bill, my colleagues, Deputy Howlin and Deputy Pattison, made the case convincingly that the Tánaiste led workers from Castlecomer to believe they would be covered by the terms of the agreement on redundancy as set out in the new partnership agreement and in this Bill. As a matter of honour, on the basis of basic decency, the Tánaiste has no option but to redress the wrong she has done not just in this instance but in regard to the thousands of others affected.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	439	As someone who received the princely sum of £300 in 1980 under the current redundancy scheme, I recall the stark reality for the long-serving members of the company for which I  worked. Unfortunately, the then Minister, former Deputy Des O'Malley, refused grant-aid to sustain the company, which was a viable company using natural resources. The stark reality of the redundancy payment for workers who had given 40 years' service was evidence of the major problem in relation to the redundancy payments scheme. Unfortunately, it has taken until now to change the scheme.There have been many sad cases of years of experience, ability and work going by the wayside due to the fact that the Government of the day did nothing to improve the scheme. Now that we have reached this stage, there is still a grey area which is causing major concern, namely, retrospection. During the Celtic tiger years there were very few redundancies and we were not accustomed to making redundancy payments. Suddenly as the Celtic tiger began to wane and redundancies became a fact of life, the Tánaiste did not know how to deal with the issue. Perhaps she made promises on retrospection in good faith which she felt she could honour. I ask her to come to this House and clarify the promises she made in regard to retrospection. The father of the House, Deputy Pattison, a man who has given a lifetime to this House, made it clear that such promises were made. I understand promises were also made to the workers of Peerless Rugs in Athy who had a number of meetings with the Tánaiste.I want to know if the Tánaiste agreed that these payments would be made. If she made these promises, she should come in here and clarify whether she made them in good faith, but because the Attorney General has stated otherwise it is not possible to honour them. It is not a lot to ask someone to clear up such confusion. The Peerless Rugs workers fought a long and difficult battle which was a lonely one at times. Despite numerous representations to the Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, they got little, if anything, in return. In fact, the courts settled the problem. The problem in that instance was that the legislation was not in place to provide an alternative payment. Because workers received the basic statutory redundancy at the time, the Labour Court made a recommendation which could not be sustained against the employer. I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, that there is need for further legislation to encompass redundancies. If the Labour Court makes a recommendation which cannot be sustained, it is imperative that the State honours these commitments. This is what happened in regard to the Peerless Rugs workers. These people were told they would receive three weeks' pay but this could not be sustained because the legislation was not in place to enforce the decision made by the Chairman of the Labour Court, Mr. Finbarr Flood.I ask the Government to consider this issue and to encompass what is happening here today. Reflecting on my case in 1980, an extra half  week's pay per year seems very little given the funding provided by workers to the Exchequer during that period. There is a need for people to reflect on this issue and to say that two weeks is not sufficient. This does not provide sufficient back-up in this day and age. In 1980, very few people owned their houses or cars but nowadays people have huge mortgage and other commitments. The size of this redundancy will not reflect the pressure, torment, worry and concern of people who are unfortunate enough to be made redundant, as we were in 1980.The Minister should consider the amendments that increase the rate of payment. The lump sum payment of one year's salary should be looked at as well. Now is the time to do something about this issue. Look at what has been done with this legislation in the past. The legislation dates from before 1980 so it has been in place for almost a quarter of a century without amendment. Will we have to wait another quarter of a century before doing something that is honest and worthy of our workers or will we continue to protect the employer, despite the efforts of so many to improve the employment situation?The Minister should do a number of things. He should ask the Tánaiste to come to the House and clarify the retrospection matter. Where the Labour Court made recommendations they should be honoured in the legislation. The amendments providing for an increased number of weeks should also be taken on board. Only then can we move forward and claim the House has produced legislation that is honourable, favourable to the worker and will do something to assist the many workers who are unfortunate enough to face redundancy.This morning I received a phone call from a woman who was made redundant in recent weeks. She was wondering if this legislation would be passed before her husband is made redundant in the next two weeks. Unfortunately, I gave her the wrong answer. I did not think it would be passed but I am delighted there will be some comfort for that woman tonight. I will be able to assure her that the legislation will be in place when her husband is made redundant.I urge the Minister to talk to the Tánaiste before the next Stage of the Bill. Consideration should be given to accepting the amendments so there can be unanimous support for this necessary legislation.

The Bill is welcome but it has been long delayed. The existing legislation has been in place for many years. In recent times we have seen many instances of people being laid off work. The sums of money they get are paltry. For people with families and school going children the sums would only last a couple of months. The redundancy payment might seem to be a big payment to some but €10,000 to €20,000 would not take one far nowadays.Redundancies will be a feature of the economic landscape in the next few years. This is mainly due to the lack of competitiveness in the economy, which has not been assisted by the policies of this Government. I will make a number of points about the IFI company in Arklow, which also had a depot in the Minister of State's constituency.

This was not a private enterprise or a company whose boardroom was located in Detroit or Denver. The boardroom of this company was basically on the benches opposite. It was most insensitive to the needs of the workers. If workers in a private company were treated in the same manner, the Minister and his colleagues would have been the first up to bang the table. These workers were sold down the Swanee, particularly the workers in the Arklow area. For a number of years they sought to put forward a viability plan for that part of the company but to this day I do not know what happened to it. It never came to fruition.There is a strong feeling among the workers that there might have been fraudulent trading. I understand the local groups will take a case against the Government. There is a strong impression that the company was kept open in view of the upcoming general election.

I am aware that this is a redundancy Bill and that it relates to workers but I should have the latitude to refer to the creditors of IFI. It will not be long before they are back at Leinster House looking for a fair deal. They are owed money by the State and their businesses are going  to the wall. Many of them are experiencing severe difficulties. I do not generally come to the House to articulate a point that is inaccurate for the sake of sensationalism. I know people from that area who are owed money by the State and who are in financial difficulty. I ask the Minister to give that message to the Tánaiste and I hope she will refer to it on Committee Stage and give them some hope that they might get their payments. My understanding is that they might get 50% of the payment in one or two years, which is not satisfactory.Fine Gael is generally in favour of any measure that will improve protection for workers. I support the Bill but the Government should seriously consider the issue of retrospection. It can be done if the will exists.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I thank the Members who contributed to the debate. It shows the humanity of the Members that so many were interested in participating in this short debate.The Tánaiste believed it was time redundancy levels and the administration of redundancy should be changed so this Bill was brought forward. Negotiations about the provisions in the Bill took place between the Government and the social partners in the Sustaining Progress programme. Account was also taken of the report of the redundancy review group. The Bill has been welcomed by all Members of the House.A number of questions were raised during the debate. The main issue mentioned by speakers from all sides of the House was retrospection. It was a cause of great concern. It was felt that the Tánaiste, at her meeting with the deputation from Comerama in Kilkenny, said that she would give retrospection to those workers. However, according to the minutes of that meeting the Tánaiste said talks were ongoing on the statutory redundancy issue and she gave an undertaking that if the legislation is changed, she will do everything she can to ensure that the Comerama workers will be included in any amendment. I was not at the meeting so I cannot say anything further. I can only quote from the information provided to me.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	452	With regard to the Comerama workers, the exit package was statutory redundancy multiplied by 3.5. That would be one and a half weeks per year for those under 41 years and 3.5 weeks per year for those over 41. That is in excess not only of the existing statutory redundancy terms but of the new statutory redundancy terms provided for in the Bill. Deputies McHugh and Finneran referred to the situation in Square D. The package agreed there was statutory redundancy plus five weeks' pay per year of ser vice, again greater than the existing statutory figure and the new statutory terms.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	453	That depends on what is the level of statutory redundancy.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	454	Those are facts, I am not making a statement on the issue. Retrospection was mentioned by almost every speaker. On advice from the Attorney General the legal position is that as a payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum is a legal requirement on employers, it could not be imposed on them with retrospective effect. Employers are entitled to due notice of the intention to require them legally to pay enhanced rates. The Redundancy Payments Bill must be brought into effect by ministerial order after enactment by the Oireachtas and it cannot be made retrospective. There was a case in 1984, Nokia Limited v. the Minister for Labour, where the Minister wanted to make a retrospective payment but it went before the courts and Mr. Justice Costello's decision was that it could not be made retrospective.This Act will come into effect once the Bill has passed through the Oireachtas and been signed by the President on Sunday, 25 May 2003.Deputy Murphy asked about redundancies. Notified redundancies for the period January to April 2003 are about 1% less than for the period January to April 2002. The Deputy should look at the live register in his own area – it stands at 3.6% – and if he deducts 40% of that figure he will find the level of unemployment, which is low in spite of current circumstances.Deputy Morgan acknowledged the Bill but then went into a tirade about the economy going downhill and a lack of progress in recent years. We reduced tax from 28% to 20% and 55,700 houses were built last year, more than in any other year. Public services have been improved.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	455	What public services? Not health, education and local government.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	456	Generally the economy has performed well. An additional 300,000 people are working. Improvements have been made in the past five years.The payment of two weeks' pay per year of service was raised by many speakers. That is the figure that was agreed between the unions, the representatives of the workers, and the Government and that should be remembered.Deputy Joe Higgins stated that there was no benefit whatsoever in the changes that are being introduced. He said that if an employee was earning €400 per week, the changes would be irrelevant. If a person is earning €400 per week and has ten years' service, as the Deputy mentioned, under this Bill that person will get €8,400. At present, if the person is under 41, he would get €2,400 and if he is over 41, he would get €4,400. There are substantial benefits in the increases contained in the Bill.Deputy O'Donovan asked if temporary and part-time workers will receive redundancy under this legislation – they will, provided they have two years' service.Deputies O'Dowd and Kirk asked about workers in Lissadell Towels. They do not qualify because the Bill will not be enacted until 25 May. Those workers will receive their cheques soon; some probably received them today because they were issued yesterday.Deputy Naughten forgot the subject matter of this Bill and launched into a discussion on insurance. I agree that insurance presents major problems for the economy in terms of competitiveness. The MIAB brought out a report containing 60 recommendations, some of which have already been put into effect and which are already benefiting car insurance, with reduced or level premiums being requested. On the PIAB, it was also made clear, despite an assertion by the Opposition, that this report will have immediate effect. It has had such an effect in the motor insurance sector but we also made it clear that it would take between a year and a year and a half before there benefits would be seen in the employee liability sector. Change will not happen overnight.Deputy Timmins asked about redundancy for workers at IFI and the problems of the employees there have been worked out to a satisfactory conclusion. He also asked me to bring the issue of creditors to the attention of the Tánaiste. I will do that.I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 5, line 19, after "to" to insert "the conduct of".This deals with the definition of redundancy. The Tánaiste in her speech this morning spoke about the issue of redundancy being impersonal and mentioned the findings of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the St. Ledger v. Frontline Distributors Limited case. As I said on Second Stage, the narrow definition where anything related to an individual is not seen as redundancy might have unforeseen results. I gave an example this morning of a person being made redundant on the basis of a last in, first out policy. That is personal to the individual and it could be argued that, therefore, it is not redundancy and there is no entitlement to redundancy payment. My amendment suggests that “not related to the con duct of the employee” should replace “not related to the employee”. It occurred to me that last in, first out is directly related to the employee and it is possible there could be other areas I have not thought of that are related to the employee that might make the current definition too simplistic and allow a hole to be punched in the definition of redundancy.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I will not be accepting this amendment. The conduct of the employee is dealt with under section 6(4)(b) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977. That section provides that the dismissal of an employee shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act not to be an unfair dismissal if it results wholly or mainly from the capability, competence or qualifications of the employee for performing work of the kind which he was employed by the employer to do or the conduct of the employee.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	459	It is always unfortunate when the reply to the argument is written before the argument is made. The Minister of State made no reference at all to the argument I made. I am aware the issue of conduct is dealt with elsewhere. If somebody is dismissed because of conduct that is not redundancy. That is not my point. The point is that the new definition of redundancy that this new section creates in the principal Act makes a case whereby something that is personal to an individual, if that is the cause of the redundancy, is not in fact redundancy. In the example that I have given, the very nature of being employed is personal. If one is let go for that personal reason, that could be used by some to argue that no redundancy is payable because one is not redundant. That is the case I am making. It has nothing to do with conduct. I want to broaden the definition to include conduct because that would clarify what we mean by redundancy.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I support Deputy Howlin's amendment which is meritorious. I can think of two examples of people who would have been affected similarly. In Thermal Heat Exchangers Limited in Drogheda which closed two years ago, that situation would have applied. It is most unfortunate that the amendment is not being considered. The Minister of State is dismissing it in a cavalier fashion. I am told by my researcher, who is still working on it, that a similar case existed in the Lissadell factory between Ardee and Carrickmacross with which you, a Cheann Comhairle, would be familiar, it being in your constituency.In Louth, the smallest county, we can already pluck two cases after a short period of research in which this would apply. There is a case for it across the board and it is unfortunate that it is not accepted. My calling on the Minister of State to consider is hardly going to stretch it much further.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The wording in the Bill is based on advice from the experienced vice-chairman of the Employment Appeals Tribunal who is a senior counsel and parliamentary counsel. It is the job that becomes redundant and it is only as a consequence of the job becoming redundant that the person loses the job. It is job-related rather than person-related. This section also brings the redundancy definition into line with the definition given in the EU directive on collective redundancies 75/129/EEC Council Directive of 17 February 1975. It is the job, not the conduct of the individual, that is redundant and that is the advice from the senior and parliamentary counsel.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I do not want to labour this for too long but it is frustrating when the net points I argue are not addressed. I know that the intention of the amendment is to detach the notion of redundancy from an individual action. If the job is going it is a redundancy. In effect what the new principal Act will say, if the Minister of State's new section is inserted, is that redundancy will be, "for one or more reasons not related to the employee concerned."  That is plain English. I have instanced something that is patently of concern to an employee. It is unforeseen, it is not intended by the Minister of State, the draftsman or the ILO regulation about which he has spoken, but it will be what we enact in our law and it will be arguable in the courts. That is not what we want so why would he not accept it, if he can accept that my amendment will do no damage to the objective on which we are agreed?

I would have thought that was the prerogative of the House. I accept readily that I am still on a learning curve in terms of the nuances and exceptionally fine detail of some of these relationships between the House and the Department of Finance in particular, but there are few amendments that could have been tabled regarding this Bill that would not in some way have involved a charge on the Revenue. The House should at least have been given the opportunity to discuss the motion and if the House wished to accept it then it should have been offered.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	479	While there is no amendment tabled to this section, in the future in this area consideration should be given to the principle that part of the Act would include an obligation on employers to bring in outreach programmes for those who are being made redundant, to prepare them for life after work in their organisations. People who have worked for many years do not understand how to obtain employment. For example they may never have had a curriculum vitae and may not know how to draw one up. They may have no interview techniques or not have done an interview for years. They do not know how to do a job search campaign under modern employment seeking opportunities.I have seen good companies introduce a programme when their employees were made redundant which prepared them for life after redundancy. The experience of one company was that after three months, 90% of those who were made redundant and wanted employment found employment, and after 12 months, 100% of those who wanted work were employed, according to the company's research.In future the obligation should be put on the employer and the State should make the same recompense towards the expense of an employer bringing in that programme as it makes towards the payment of the redundancy.

Section 8 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1971 deals with redundancy payments to certain employees dismissed before that date, meaning that there is a precedent for retrospection to come into play. The amendment has been ruled out of order because of a technicality and I obviously accept your ruling on that, a Cheann Comhairle. Nevertheless, in the course of the earlier debate and because it is relevant now, I ask people to acknowledge that such retrospection has already happened. The precedent is already there in section 8 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, which deals with redundancy payments to certain employees dismissed before the commencement of the Act. I am attempting to assist the Minister in her current difficulties.

I understand that the ceiling provided in what is now section 11 to us, was section 12(2) in the original Bill as proposed. That purports to provide a ceiling, but that refers to section 4(2) of the Redundancy Payments Act 1979, which in turn refers back to the power to vary the amount referred to in paragraph 2 of the Third Schedule to the Redundancy Payments Act 1967. I understand that this Bill also repeals that section. I am therefore content not to seek to remove the ceiling since I do not think it is operative.

In page 9, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:"(d) so that all legal disputes regarding statutory redundancy and minimum notice be determined by the Rights Commissioner.”.Currently, if there are any disputes over statutory redundancy or minimum notice entitlements, the matter must be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. Although it should not be the case, such a referral can sometimes be costly to the employer or employee. Accordingly, I suggest that employees be able to refer any disputes to a rights commissioner as provided for under the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977. Perhaps the Minister might take that into account.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I will not accept the amendment. Legal disputes covering statutory redundancy and minimum notice are determined by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, something generally considered by practitioners to be the appropriate forum, given the sometimes complicated legal issues involved. The Government is committed to reviewing the employment rights bodies,  and my Department will initiate that review towards the end of the year. It is envisaged that the review will consider the current employment rights legislation and the legislation governing the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Rights Commissioner service and the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The review's aim will be to make recommendations on the services of the employment rights bodies to ensure that they are clear, coherent and user-friendly.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	489	When the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which deals with redundancy, was established, it was meant as a semi-formal, fairly inexpensive way of dealing with industrial relations issues under the various Acts, including those covering redundancy payments. However, within a few years, the lawyers got involved and changed the Employment Appeals Tribunal to make it an extremely expensive undertaking for an employee or even an employer. Now the most eminent of barristers are involving themselves at great expense. I remember that when the tribunal was introduced in 1977, trade union and Federated Union of Employers officials dealt with everything in an inexpensive way. That has unfortunately all changed, and if anything can be done to reverse that, it should be examined.

As Members are aware, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle cannot make a contribution in a debate on the floor of the House any more than the Ceann Comhairle. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle makes his contribution in his capacity as an ordinary Member, as he is entitled, and it would not be in order to attribute actions to any Leas-Cheann Comhairle when he was clearly acting in his capacity as an ordinary Member of the House.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I want to oppose section 17 on the basis that the Government has failed to include a commitment given by the Minister arising from a meeting on 12 December 2002 to workers of Comerama, Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, to include those workers in the benefits of Sustaining Progress, the national partnership agreement.This will have a knock-on effect for other workers who have been made redundant since 28 November 2002. I do not accept the legal advice outlined by the Tánaiste in her Second Stage contribution as sufficient reason to turn down this request. There have been precedents in the past where ex gratia payments have been made, for example, the Talbot workers were effectively nationalised by the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, because it suited him politically to do so. If the Government has the political will to implement the word of the Tánaiste in the context of this legislation it can be done. The legal advice has indicated that it is the legal charge on the employers that is causing the difficulty. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the obligation on the Government to include as an ex gratia payment its portion of the payment from the social insurance fund to the workers of Comerama,  Castlecomer and other workers who have been affected. In justice I appeal to the Government and the Minister to reconsider this matter given the solemn undertaking they have received and to take on board the genuine contributions made by Members who were present at that meeting and the letters read into the record from workers' representatives who were also present at that meeting. It appears the only person out of step in regard to what happened at that meeting is the Tánaiste. That is regrettable and I shall oppose the section on that basis.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I too oppose this section. I am disquieted by the way the Government has responded to the debate today. A serious issue has arisen about a commitment made. We have established, prime facie,that a commitment was made by the Tánaiste to a group of workers and the Tánaiste has denied such a commitment. It is incumbent on her to come into the House and answer it. I am not allowed refer to the office of the Leas-Ceann Comhairle but I refer to the father of this House, one of its most revered Members, who does not lightly make clear assertions in the House. I have never heard such a clear assertion that he was present when a commitment was made.This morning I referred to the meeting that took place on 12 December 2002 and I now refer to a second meeting which took place on 15 January 2003 attended by at least 12 people, including SIPTU representatives, politicians and representatives of Enterprise Ireland. That meeting was presided over by the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward. I am advised his opening remarks referred to the good news that statutory redundancy improvements had been agreed at the pay talks and he referred to the Tánaiste's promise to extend these to the Comerama workers. Everybody could not be out of step, everybody could not have misheard, everybody could not be wrong except the Tánaiste. I accept that whatever commitment was made was made in good faith. It has been established, prime facie, that a commitment was made. A document which has been circulated this week has been referred to as a minute. A minute is an agreed account of a meeting. One side does not produce a minute. That document was not put to anybody else for agreement except, I understand, the Tánaiste and her staff. It is incumbent on the Tánaiste to honour the commitment given. If she cannot do it in the way she had hoped, that is, by making the provisions of this enactment retrospective she should be clever enough to provide an alternative device, perhaps by way of an ex gratia payment to those workers who acted in good faith and accepted her word in good faith. I said previously the Tánaiste had indicated that the unions knew at this time that it would be legally impossible to make it retrospective. That is what she told us on 8 May in response to Deputy Rabbitte's question. Why did she say  then she would do her best if she knew already that it was legally impossible? Either she was being disingenuous or perpetrating a con. That is the reality. I am deeply sorry the Tánaiste is not present to clarify this matter. What is required now is that this problem will be addressed in good faith and in honour for those who have got, what is acknowledged by everyone in the House as inadequate statutory redundancy under a system that will exist up to the enactment of this provision, which it is hoped will be on 25 May. I hope the Minister of State will indicate that he will do that.Will the Minister of State indicate exactly when this provision will come into effect? Will RPIs returned between now and 25 May be processed by his Department? Will the people concerned receive the letter payments currently operative? Those who are now redundant and who are in the process of returning RPIs should have clarity of their position.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I am concerned the Tánaiste is not here to give an explanation on her position in regard to the meeting and the commitment that was apparently given. I say "apparently", but it is not fair to use that word because that over qualifies it given the number of Deputies who were present, all of whom were unanimous on it. The word "apparent" is nearly an insult to them, given their numbers and their powerful recall in terms of the detail. There is no "ifs", "buts", "maybes", or doubts on their part. I recall a presidential election a few years ago where one of the candidates had a difficulty with a memory issue and it cost him the election. On that basis alone, the Tánaiste should be here to answer this charge and to clarify matters still further.On the substantive issue of the section and given the restrictions imposed on the amendments by virtue of the Standing Orders I would have no problem with shuffling these amendments across the floor to the Minister of State to move them and I do not mind if my name is not associated with them. I am sure the workers in this part of the State would be enamoured by him and he would probably get significant support from them. Certainly they are entitled to that consideration from the Minister of State. I am sure other Deputies would do likewise.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	504	I made my position clear this morning. To be consistent, I could not support this section and will have to oppose it. It is a pity the Tánaiste is not here to inform the House if she will consider other ways of compensating the workers. We could support the section if the Tánaiste indicated to the House that she was prepared to remedy this problem under, say, a separate Estimate under her Department, as was done in the case of the Talbot workers, or by some other means. I cannot expect the Minister of State to give us those assurances. In the light of that I support the opposition to section 17.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	505	It is a sad day for workers particularly those who have lost their jobs, many of whom have given 30 to 35 years service to particular employers, in the context of the Social Partnership Agreement, Sustaining Progress, the vote on which was close. Many people voted on the understanding that an enhanced redundancy payment scheme would be introduced. Apart altogether from a commitment given by the Tánaiste and other Government Ministers throughout the country—

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I am clear about the commitments made. Since the national agreement was finalised, many workers have indicated that they will require redundancy payments at the agreed enhanced rate. I do not accept the advice on retrospective payments.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	508	That was the decision.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The issue is centred on employers on the basis that it would be unfair to ask them to make retrospective payments. We are also concerned with redundancies arising from insolvency, where payments will be made under the insolvency payments scheme. That does not involve retrospective payment. There is, therefore, a mechanism to meet the needs of employees who have been made redundant. If employers are not prepared to accept the legitimate points made by the Opposition it is for the Government to propose an alternative mechanism that will do justice to employees who have given years of service and who look to this Bill for a proper recompense.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	514	On the question of overcoming the legal difficulties with retrospection, statutory redundancy is an employment right and involves a corresponding obligation on employers. The State, through the social insurance fund, gives a rebate to the employers who fulfil their statutory redundancy obligations. In exceptional circumstances only, such as liquidation, the State pays the entire statutory amount to the employees who would not otherwise receive payment. The State then seeks to recover these payments from the assets of the business.There is no logistical provision whereby the State can make additional redundancy payments to employees. Accordingly, for the State to make additional payments to employees, legislative authority would be required. In effect, a new scheme would be required to make additional payments. The cost involved would depend on the parameters of any such hypothetical scheme. There is no intention to devise such a scheme, which would inevitably be both complex and costly. The projected annual cost of the Redundancy Payments Bill, at €149 million, gives an idea of the magnitude of the cost that could be involved.It was clearly understood by all parties during the negotiations leading up to Sustaining Progress that retrospection was not possible. The swift passage of this Bill means new redundancy provisions agreed in Sustaining Progress will be implemented in the shortest possible time frame.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	517	Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued through the United Nations which has the primary role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN possesses no standing military forces of its own and relies on the provision of such resources by willing members. National sovereignty is a fundamental underlying principle of participation in the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP. Participation in any specific operation by member states is decided on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with respective national decision making procedures.The provisions relating to participation of members of the Defence Forces in overseas missions are set out in the Defence (Amendment) (No 2) Act 1960, as amended by the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993, which provides that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may  be despatched for service outside the State as part of a particular international United Nations force. Participation in an overseas operation requires UN authorisation, a specific Government decision and, where the level of participation is to exceed 12 members of the Defence Forces, the approval of Dáil Éireann. At a time of geopolitical instability and change, it is important that the international community continues to support the United Nations in maintaining peace and stability.While I would not wish that our legislative provisions would prevent the Defence Forces from participation in missions which support Ireland's underlying principles of providing support in the areas of international peacekeeping, humanitarian missions, or peace support operations, it is important at this time that our decision-making process continues to reflect our support for the United Nations. In this regard, the circumstances which arose in relation to the participation of the Defence Forces in the first EU peace support operation, currently under way in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, are unlikely to recur.These circumstances, it will be recalled, related to the fact that while a United Nations Resolution, 1371 welcomed international efforts, including the efforts of the EU, to support the implementation of the Ohrid Peace Agreement in FYROM, it did not authorise an international United Nations force as required by the Defence Acts. This was a unique situation and I expect that future EU Petersberg Task missions will have the required UN authorisation, thereby enabling the Government to consider Defence Forces participation on a case by case basis. Therefore, the question of legislative change in this regard does not arise.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	518	While we all appreciate and recognise the massive contribution made by our peacekeeping troops in different parts of the world for the past 40 or 50 years, does the Minister not agree that, as things have developed in recent years, the so-called triple-lock mechanism may be an obstacle to further participation in peacekeeping missions abroad? In his reply, the Minister mentioned the recent difficulties we had in Macedonia. I also recall that last year we were almost obliged to withdraw our peacekeeping forces from Kosovo due to the fact that the United States intended to use its veto on the Security Council because it did not want its soldiers or personnel to be subject to the International Criminal Court. While we all agree it is important to have the approval of the Government and Dáil Éireann, as things are at present the triple-lock mechanism ties our hands so that we are no longer sole arbiters of whether we can participate. Some country or another on the UN Security Council might exercise a veto. The case of Macedonia had full EU and UN approval, except that the peacekeeping force was not established by the UN. It had UN approval and that kept us from  participating. Does the Minister not agree that it is time to look at the mechanism, particularly the UN establishment? Would UN approval not even be sufficient?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	519	As I said in my reply, I am anxious that the legislative situation would not prevent us from participating. There are two fundamental principles, the first of which is the democratic position, under which we have the Defence Acts, which make certain prescriptions to which we must adhere. Deputy McGinley agrees there is no problem with wanting to do that. The second question relates to the UN itself, in that the further one goes away from requiring a UN mandate, the less important the UN becomes. It is important for the international community that there is an independent, forceful and resourceful organisation, authorising mandates and getting involved.Once we get away from that, we start the process of undermining the UN authority and, if we did not have an organisation like the United Nations, we would now have to establish it. I wish to protect it as far as I can. I am not saying this House or any Government should not, from time to time, review its position and create as much flexibility as it can. However, as I see it, the Macedonian situation is one that is not likely to recur. If there were a number of such occurrences, we could return and discuss what we might do in that situation. For the time being, I want to give wholehearted support to the possibility of the UN maintaining its authority on the international front.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	520	Does the Minister not agree that there is a likelihood that the EU will initiate more peacekeeping forces which will repeat the Macedonian situation? As far as the UN is concerned, we have always been supportive. However, there seems to be some contradiction in the Government's attitude because the Iraqi campaign did not occur as a result of a UN resolution, even though the Government participated in an indirect way by providing the facilities at Shannon.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The decision to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps in July 2002 was taken due to budgetary constraints which meant that the level of defence expenditure had to be reduced. Any decision to acquire medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps in the future can only be taken as the financial resources permit. The decision to cancel the tender competition was an extremely difficult one for me. I am also aware of the acute disappointment felt by Air Corps personnel when the decision was announced.However, having consulted the military authorities in the matter at that time the main priority outlined for the Air Corps was the purchase of fixed-wing training aircraft to ensure that cadets continued to be commissioned, trained as pilots and retained in the Air Corps. In that regard, I was delighted to sign a contract with Pilatus of Switzerland in January 2003 for the supply of eight turbo propeller training aircraft which will be delivered in 2004. The value of the contract, including VAT, is around €60 million. These aircraft are a realistic response to the needs of the Air Corps at the current time.When the decision to cancel the tender competition was made, I asked my officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopter services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue, while taking account of the current financial position.An interdepartmental working group was established to seek alternate solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is also involved in assessing possible solutions. A report on this is currently being finalised.I am committed to maintaining the Air Corps role in the provision of SAR services and, in this regard, an S61 helicopter has been acquired for the Air Corps to operate in the north west region as a replacement for the Dauphin helicopter. The S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coast Guard from CHCI pursuant to existing SAR contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coast Guard to the Air Corps. The Air Corps will provide the flight crews and the aircraft will be maintained by CHCI. The S61 will operate out of Sligo Airport where training is currently ongoing. It is expected that the helicopter will go operational  for daylight hours in July 2003, with a full 24 hours service operational from October, 2003.

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	525	Does the Minister accept that the decision to cancel the order for the five medium-lift helicopters effectively tore the heart out of the Air Corps? Does he accept that it reflects a very serious situation when the GOC of the Air Corps states publicly that the decision was a blow to morale, and that the GOC is in a far better position to judge the morale of the Air Corps than the Minister? The Minister stated the last time this question was asked that morale in the Air Corps had never been higher. Would he agree that was not an accurate statement? Will he further accept that an early decision to go ahead with the order is essential for both the morale and the effectiveness of the Air Corps?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	526	I stand over my statement that morale in the Air Corps has never been higher. Deputy Wall has been out to Baldonnell, but if Deputy Sherlock had the time to visit he would see the type of investment that has been made there in recent years: a new hangar, a new helicopter wing, and now the purchase of trainer aircraft. Admittedly, the cancellation of the order for the helicopters was a blow to the Air Corps and was very disappointing to me also, but the total investment has been very significant. We are looking forward to acquiring the trainer aircraft between March and June of next year.A recent interview with the GOC, a very forward-looking man with great vision and commitment, was an extremely positive one from the point of view of the Air Corps and his vision of the future. I am at one with him in terms of knowing that the investment by this Government and the previous Administration in the Air Corps bears no comparison with that of any previous Administration. We are looking forward to continuing that work. Great needs were overlooked for a long time, but we are gradually responding to all of them.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	527	That this was a blow to the morale of the Air Corps was a very significant statement coming from the GOC. Why has the Government decided that the needs and comforts of Ministers with regard to travel are more important than the operational needs of the Air Corps? Will he accept that the order for the two jets should be scrapped and the orders for the helicopters reinstated?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	528	There is obviously quite a misunderstanding here, because the amounts of money which are being provided for the trainer  aircraft will probably end up being significantly higher than those for ministerial transport requirements. It is important that the Deputy realises that the pilots, the people who run and organise ministerial transport, are members of the Air Corps and that in terms of training, opportunity and so on, that provides an excellent part of their overall activity.The value of this country in terms of current and capital expenditure is the equivalent of a €39 billion industry. There are small companies in this country, with values of about €100 million, making their own transport arrangements to create the flexibility they require to do business all over the world. We have significantly expanding business throughout the EU and beyond. Scheduled flights do not always suit us, nor do they always suit other Governments. We want to do business on behalf of this country in a forward-looking, businesslike way, spending as much time as we can in Ireland and at the same time having speedy access to the work we do abroad. That is an important part of the work the Air Corps does.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	532	Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.The Government has decided to replace both the Gulfstream IV and the Beechcraft King Air in the ministerial air transport role. The Gulfstream IV is not being replaced by two jet aircraft, as stated by Deputy Gormley. The decision to replace both aircraft was necessary to meet the ever-increasing demands of Government business, not least in the context of a significantly enlarged European Union. The Gulfstream IV has played an integral part in the operation of the ministerial air transport service since it was acquired in December 1991. The aircraft is in a fully airworthy condition and remains in service.The decision to replace the aircraft is based on the increased demands on the ministerial air transport service. The tender competitions for the acquisition of the two aircraft are now in train. The closing date for the receipt of tenders for both competitions is Friday, 30 May 2003. The  tender competitions allow for the submission of both new and pre-owned aircraft. All options such as outright purchase, lease and lease purchase will be considered. The highly competitive nature of the aviation market at present should result in competitive packages being offered. In tandem with proposals for the supply of the aircraft, tenderers may also outline offers for the Gulfstream IV aircraft as at the proposed date of handover of the tendered aircraft or in mid-July 2004, following the EU Presidency. Offers for the Beechcraft King Air will also be considered in tandem with proposals for its replacement.The acquisition of the aircraft will be the subject of a detailed cost benefit analysis, including value for money and comparison with costs associated with alternative arrangements. The responses to the tender process will determine the most advantageous system of payment. The actual cost of the acquisition of the aircraft can only be defined after the tender competition, particularly in view of the fact that pre-owned aircraft are a consideration. It is expected that the new aircraft should be available for operational service by 1 October 2003.

Does he accept that the Gulfstream IV would under normal circumstances have 13 more years of productive life in it, and that what this is really about is vanity? We have already seen the vanity of the Government, with the Taoiseach spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on make-up. Even the Queen of England travels in the first-class section of a commercial aircraft on occasion. Why can this Government not do the same?Is it true that representatives from Airbus are currently in town, wining and dining the Government with the aim of winning this contract? Can the Minister outline in some detail what is actually going on in relation to potential contractual arrangements with these customers?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	534	Nobody is wining and dining the Government. The business of the procurement will be done under the tightest of scrutiny and in the safest way I can achieve for the benefit of the people. In 1991, when this country faced horrendous unemployment problems, when the health service contained only a fraction of the number of people that currently work there, a forward-looking Government acquired the Gulfstream IV for ministerial transport. It has paid for itself over and over by providing a flexible facility to do the kind of business that is done by forward-looking governments in the interests of the people they represent.The Deputy will be quite surprised, when this process is over, to see that despite all the craw-thumping and pretending, the acquisition of this  aircraft will not in any way have affected the provision of our health services, into which we have put considerable additional funds and staff. The Deputy and others talk about the problem of elderly people for Ireland in the future. As a result of better housing, better nutrition and better health services, people are living considerably longer. This is thanks to the advances that have been made in our health services and the people who work in them, although that is not to say that there are not difficulties and problems to be overcome.As far as the tender process is concerned, we expect these tenders to be in on 30 May. The process to determine the most satisfactory outcome and the way in which it will be financed will be exacting. This will be done in the most beneficial way for people. There will be no wining and dining or preferential treatment for anybody in this development.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	535	Have representatives of the Airbus company not been in town talking to representatives of the Government on this matter? Will the Minister clarify if that is the case. He should forget the term "wining and dining" if he does not want to use that expression. That is the term I have heard from an aviation expert, but if the Minister chooses not to use it that is fine. Have those representatives not been arguing that France and Italy have similar aircraft and they are trying to use that line to persuade the Government to take an Airbus?Why is the G4 not satisfactory? It still has productive life in it. Is it not the case that the aircraft was subjected to uses of travel that wore it out to some extent? It was used as a taxi service and that is not how it should have been used, hopping from here to there, flying to Kerry for instance and on other such journeys. We must be a little more careful with the way we treat our aircraft in the future.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	536	The Deputy cannot have it both ways.

I do not know what the outcome to the tender process will be, whether it will be sold in that context or whether it will be retained, but we will find the best possible path to give the taxpayer value for money and at the same time enable the Government to do its business in a progressive and businesslike way. People interested in selling aircraft may come to this town and meet people. I have not met nor will I be meeting anybody in this connection.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The roles of the Defence Forces as assigned by Government are set out in the White Paper on Defence which was published in February 2000. To aid the civil power – meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána who have the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State – is among the assigned roles. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required in duties which include cash escorts. Cash escorts include deliveries to banks, post offices and other institutions.The total cost in respect of the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda Síochána in protecting movements of cash for the years 2000 to 2002, including pay, allowances, transport and aerial surveillance, was as follows: €5.97 million in 2000; €6.58 million in 2001; and €6.85 million in 2002. Part of these costs are recouped from the banks through an annual contribution. A sum of €2.86 million has been refunded by the banks to my Department each year since 1995.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	544	According to the Minister's reply and if my calculations are correct, the total cost to the Defence Forces of engaging in this escort duty was €6.85 in 2002, yet the reimbursement for this service from the banks was €2.86 million, which means the Department is out of pocket or subsidising these financial institutions to the tune of €4 million annually. This is happening at a time when there are deferments and cancellations of Defence Forces equipment right, left and centre. We read last week that the helicopter contract was deferred or cancelled. Also, the 65 light armoured vehicles that were ordered have been deferred and we are even down to the stage where the purchase of pistols at a cost of €630 each for soldiers and officers has been deferred or cancelled. The screws are being turned on every area of Defence Forces expenditure, yet we are able to subsidise these financial institutions to the tune of €4 million or perhaps more a year at a time when they are making unprecedented profits. I understand that one of the major financial institutions made a profit – I am not talking about its turnover – of €1.4 billion in 2002 and another made a profit of €1.2 billion. As Deputy Sherlock and others said, the Army is suffering severe cutbacks and its personnel are not able to go about their duties in an efficient way. Could the banks not make a more realistic contribution towards the purchase of some of this equipment, even the pistols? A sum of €1 million would purchase 1,600 pistols and €4 million would purchase about 7,000 of them. Perhaps the Minister should examine that aspect.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	545	Members of the Defence Forces already have 2,000 pistols and I am delighted the Deputy wants to make sure they are given another 6,000 to 8,000, but I do not know what he would want to do with them.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	547	They are in perfect working order. The Deputy would be in mortal danger if he sat and asked anyone to try them out on him. I would not do that. The Deputy is obviously more ready for execution than I am.The Defence Forces never had it so good. In terms of Navy ships, aircraft for the Air Corps, APCs, buildings, improvements in accommodation, uniforms and constant recruitment, that side is perfect. The net additional cost to the Defence Forces for providing cash escorts for 2000 was €2.53 million, for 2001 was €2.82 million and for 2002 was €2.98 million.As the Deputy is aware the staff involved are permanent staff and would be paid for other duties if they were not doing this work. We supply cash escorts to the post offices and social welfare offices and they are included in those costs. Some element of the permanent pay costs should be met by the banking institutions. I am instituting negotiations to see what I can do to increase that amount. It would be very beneficial if we were in a position to do that. This is a matter I am seriously considering.These matters arose for security situations. For example, the fear that subversives would be in a position to derail cash escorts to post offices, banks and offices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The State has an obligation in that aspect of security to protect its people and its property. One needs to take the whole matter in the round, but such considerations will not prevent me from trying to negotiate a more favourable outcome in respect of the amounts of money available from the banks for this activity.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	548	Am I right in assuming that the financial institutions made no contribution for this service since it was initiated in the late 1970s until 1992, a period of 15 years? Am I also right in assuming that the contribution they make to the Department of Defence – the position in respect of Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is separate – merely covers the cost of diesel used and does not even cover the cost of depreciation of these vehicles? We know there are 44 such escorts every week, each costing about €6,000, they happen 52 weeks of the year and many millions of euro are involved. Despite this, financial institutions only pay slightly more than €2 million. I am glad the Minister has told the Dáil he will make approaches to these financial institutions to try to obtain a more meaningful contribution from them. It is past time that it should be done.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I know that, on Question Time, there is probably nothing wrong with exaggerating the position. However, to suggest that the funds provided by banks to the Department of Defence only pay for diesel is nonsense. I said, based on accurate figures, that all the marginal and net additional costs of this activity are recouped.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	552	On 15 January 2003 I approved in principle the report of the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the reserve which had reported to me in September 1999.The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly re-organised and restructured, and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This specific aspect will, in general terms, be retained in future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are being prepared within each brigade for the  amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report.The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of proposed newly amalgamated units, but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to take part in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force.Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the re-organisation process in terms of better clothing, improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the reserve, a better overall organisation structure, and opportunities for suitably qualified reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the reserve with the Army.I am mindful of the need to preserve and retain the many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.No final decision on the amalgamation of FCA units will be taken until I have had the opportunity to examine and approve the final amalgamation proposals which are to be submitted to me by June, 2003. However, the General Officer Commanding, Western Brigade, has proposed the amalgamation of the 18th Infantry Battalion with the 25th Infantry Battalion and a consequent reduction in the number of companies. This proposal will in effect concentrate efforts and training resources in Athenry where on average 75 members of the FCA attend annual training each year. The Reserve Defence Force will remain a vibrant part of the community in the Athenry area. No Reserve Defence Force location will be closed and no member of the RDF will be asked or required to terminate service.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I thank the Minister for his reply and note what he said. Will he clarify that, in the amalgamation to which he has referred, the local FCA unit in Athenry will not be disbanded, downgraded, demoted or relocated outside the town? I seek this clarification because Athenry has had a military presence since its foundation in 1242. It was one of the few places and maybe the only one outside Dublin that took part in the Easter Rising.The concern in Athenry is that, in the review to which the Minister referred, the association of the town with the FCA down the years will stand for nothing and the fact that the force has provided an environment for the development of local youth in the town and has nurtured a sense  of pride in the Defence Forces in general will be disregarded.What effect, if any, will the proposed amalgamation to which he has referred of the 18th and 25th infantry battalions have on FCA units within the region?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	554	The amalgamation of the 18th and 25th infantry battalions will have a consequent reduction in the number of companies. The proposal will in effect concentrate efforts and training resources in Athenry where on average 75 members of the FCA attend annual training each year. The Reserve Defence Force will remain a vibrant part of the community in the Athenry area. It would be difficult to improve on what I said in reply to the question.In the final part of his question, Deputy McHugh asked what would be the advantages. A significant review was undertaken involving members of the reserve to find out what was wrong with the force, how it needed to be improved and what should happen into the future. A number of items emerged. There was a difficulty in recruiting new members and training was far from adequate and varied throughout the country. I want to give an opportunity for members of the reserve to participate ultimately in overseas missions. Benefits have already been seen in training, accommodation and improvements in equipment and clothing.All these proposals arise from a significant review. We had recommendations from the steering group report and now we have the implementation plan over a six year period. This will place the reserve on a much stronger footing into the future. Athenry remains an integral part of all this development and should have no fears for the future.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	555	Will the Minister clarify his statement? He said amalgamations will take place but also that no locations will be closed. Perhaps I am not getting the message but I find that difficult to comprehend. If amalgamations occur, surely there will be a need for fewer locations. Am I misunderstanding something?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	556	No, because in the context of the reserve, I said I wanted to maintain the geographical spread. There are many isolated areas where people would be too far from the main centre and I therefore want to keep them as active and participating as much as I can. We do not foresee the need for closures.As has been the case with the Permanent Defence Force, some places need greater access to better equipment, centralised training and better opportunities to allow them recruit new members as a result of that. The "stay as you were, change nothing, keep everything we have together" policy, either in Government, the shop one owns, the farm one has or the business one  runs, is a recipe for decay and disaster. We must move on.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	557	The mission of the equitation school is to promote the Irish non-thoroughbred horse. The school has discharged this task with considerable distinction down the years. Through its participation in equestrian events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse. The school has also consistently provided horses and riders of the highest quality for Irish international show jumping teams and, allowing for the contribution of individual civilian riders, the Army riders have in many respects formed the backbone of international teams over many years and have made a major contribution to Ireland qualifying for the Nations Cup Super League in 2003.As with all services, additional investment is required occasionally to replace and upgrade facilities and to support further development. In this regard, I was glad to be in a position to provide funding for considerable investment in the school in recent years. Specifically, an additional provision of €330,000 in the 2001 Defence Estimate, which is a 46% increase on 2000, was maintained in 2002. This investment has reaped significant dividends, especially in 2002 when the school achieved 25 international victories, the largest number in almost 20 years.The equitation school is currently in a very healthy position with 55 horses, including 36 showjumping and eventing horses and has 37 personnel, including seven riding officers and one cadet officer in training. The provision in the 2003 Estimate for the equitation school reflects the normal annual level of expenditure for the school.The amount expended in the past two years involved additional investment in the school. As a result of this investment, I am satisfied that the school is now on a very sound footing to meet future challenges and to continue to develop its horses and riders, to effectively meet its objective of promoting the Irish non-thoroughbred horse, at both national and international level.

It seems to me to be a poor reward for such outstanding victories in  2002 to have its Estimate cut by almost one quarter.I am particularly concerned about the reduction in the Estimate for the purchase of horses which has been cut by €175,000. It seems that is ill-advised and for such a small amount we have over the years gained marvellous value and benefit from the equitation school. It has raised the morale of the Defence Forces and has raised morale nationally. I want to see the school being fully equipped and able to replace the horses to the highest international standard. I ask the Minister for a commitment that he shares this view.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	559	When I became Minister for Defence, it would be fair to say that the equitation school was under fairly mortal threat. I saw to it that additional resources would be provided for the very purpose which the Deputy has outlined. Buying good horses is the life blood of the equitation school.We took a number of other initiatives including the improvement of accommodation, bursary grants. Of necessity the purchase of additional horses led to additional veterinary, forage and other costs. We now have the highest complement of horses in the school for a long time and their work has been very successful.The Deputy can be assured and he knows from his own experience in Government that there are times when one has an opportunity to inject significant additional resources for a specific purpose. It is not necessary that those resources are maintained every year because it depends on opportunities. I have always told the equitation school that should an ideal opportunity arise for the acquisition of a particular horse, they should inform me and I will assist in whatever way I can. I have maintained a flexible approach to the acquisition of horses because the school was in very significant decline when I became Minister. The Deputy need have no fears for the future.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	560	Apart from the reduction in the moneys for the purchase of horses, there is also a reduction in the moneys set aside for maintenance and a reduction in the expenses for the teams at horse shows. These are worrying signals and I am glad to be given the Minister's assurances.If the Minister is saving money this year, there is a contrast between this and the other question I have tabled where the Minister has doubled the money for military entertainment, roughly the cut that he has made in the equitation school funding. I suggest it requires some explanation from the Minister in that I think the moneys provided for the equitation school bring far better value to the Defence Forces and the country than the moneys set aside for military entertainment which has gone up from €200,000 to €440,000.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	561	As far as the equitation school is concerned, I have a fairly significant role to play in terms of determining its Estimate. I do  not have the same role in determining the aspect which has been raised by the Deputy, beyond to say that apart from preparing for the presidency of the European Council next year, unfortunately this year we are obliged to hold a conference under OSCE and invite two members each from 54 countries and keep them for four days. The detail shows that the entertainment is not for individual members of the Defence Forces or for any splashing out but is part of the role—

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	563	That conference alone will cost €110,000. This is part and parcel of the responsibilities of Government which the Deputy will have experienced when he was in Government.There are times when we say that if we did not have to do this we would prefer to be doing something else but that is part of our role. I assure the Deputy that I am well aware of the interest shown in Cork in the equitation school and the school is in safe hands.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I will allow brief supplementary questions from Deputies Wall and McGinley.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	565	I compliment the Department on the success of its involvement with the Irish showjumping team which had major successes in competitions around the world. I hope the Minister's commitment given in the House today does not alter that.Did the Minister say there was only one cadet training in the equitation school?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I did not say there was only one cadet. There are two bursaries but I did not say there was only one cadet.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	567	The development of the equitation school depends on the number of people in the college. The equitation school is represented at local level in the local shows such as the Kildare show and also at national shows. I was pleased to see the participation of young horses in the national and international shows.What is the Department's policy on the leasing of horses for use in the school?
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	568	We all appreciate the major achievements of the Army Equitation School both last year and since the foundation of the State. It is not an exaggeration to say they have put Irish showjumping on the world map.Will participation in tournaments this year be affected by the cutbacks? Will they be prevented from participating in any tournaments that they participated in last year and previous years? In his negotiations with the banks, will the Minister suggest that the banks could assist by means of sponsorship of the equitation school if there is to be a 25% cutback in funding?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	569	As I explained earlier, this is not a cutback. There were a couple of years where I tried to lift the Estimate for the equitation school by a very substantial amount to do very specific work. We now have 55 horses and 37 personnel, seven riding officers. It is correct to say that there is one cadet in training but I was combining the whole lot together.Leasing of horses is an integral part of how it works. Quite a number of owners of very good horses do not want to sell them. They are quite prepared to lease them to the school because of its reputation and how the horses will be cared for and the opportunities it offers. Those arrangements will continue.I welcome any help Deputy McGinley can give me with the banks in this matter. I am not aware of any opportunity that will be missed because of the Estimates. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has just entered the House and he may help.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	570	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 16, 29, 47, 51 and 53 together.The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Per manent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. The White Paper also provided for the option of having 250 recruits in training at any one time. It is intended that an average number of 10,600 personnel will be maintained throughout 2003. There are no proposals to effect any change in the new approved numbers as set out in the White Paper and in the Price Waterhouse report. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces.The protection of vital installations throughout the country is primarily a matter for An Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces aids the civil  power by providing military guards at designated vital installations. The Defence Forces also provide mobile patrols to vital installations as required and are prepared to provide additional assistance as necessary. The military strength of armed guards and mobile patrols is a matter of ongoing review subject to a threat analysis of security matters both within and outside the State.The strength of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and the number of female personnel by rank within these services, as advised by the military authorities, is provided in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to publish in the Official Report. The figures provided are as on 31 March 2003 and are the most recent available.Strength of Females in the Defence ForcesLtGenMajGenBrigGenColLtColComdtCaptLTTotalOffersSMBqmsCSCqmsSgtsCplsTotalNcosPtesCadetsArmy0000013302871002110668020913Air Corps0000001230010056141Naval Service000000014140000000426Strength of Males in the Defence ForcesLtGenMajGenBrigGenColLtColComdtCaptLTTotalOffersSMBqmsCSCqmsSgtsCplsTotalNcosPtesCadetsArmy1373611933625017392534371402481,0511,5063,0164,10388Air Corps00121334235913284501012419939533910Naval Service00121342214512477741519014343641015Strength of the Defence ForcesLtGenMajGenBrigGenColLtColComdtCaptLTTotalOffersSMBqmsCSCqmsSgtsCplsTotalNcosPtesCadetsArmy1373611934928020199634371432491,0611,5723,0964,312101Air Corps00121334246113584511012420440135311Naval Service00121342215913877741519014343645221
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	571	I understand that the combined strength of the Defence Forces is currently 10,600. There has been a significant overall reduction in numbers in recent years but the Minister maintains he has a leaner and more effective force. Are there any plans to reduce further the numbers in the Defence Forces? Will the Minister confirm or deny a rumour which is circulating that there are plans to reduce the numbers by a further 1,000? Are there difficulties in regard to recruitment, particularly in the Naval Service?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I do not like dealing with rumours but I intend to maintain Defence Forces numbers this year at 10,600. Any question of reducing the numbers by a further 1,000 is nonsense and should be dealt with as such. There are no recruitment difficulties beyond the normal obstacles. In some of the technical areas such as mechanical and electrical artificers and some of the engineering areas, the options in more dynamic employment throughout the economy attracted certain people in these specialist areas faster than we could replace them. However, the numbers in training in all these areas more than match our requirements, even though some will not come on stream until this year, next year or the year after, but the spade work is being done. We also allow the Naval Service to independently recruit people from outside the country. All is not perfect but things are manageable.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	573	Have we been able to retain the number of female members in the Defence Forces? It seems we have been finding it difficult to maintain female numbers within the Defence Forces in the past year.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	574	As Deputy Wall knows we were coming from a hopelessly low figure. I am sometimes reluctant to say how much the situation has improved because of the very low base from which we came. The numbers have improved substantially to approximately 436 in total. Recruitment of female members began just 17 or 18 years ago and continues to grow. Female members play a significant role in the Defence Forces. To say  the numbers are adequate would be wrong. However, the numbers have improved and we are able to retain the existing numbers.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	576	Recruitment is open. We have had discussions with representative associations to extend recruitment outside the country. The negotiations have not been concluded but we do not have recruitment problems. In fact, we had a significant recruitment programme in the past couple of years. Approximately 77 new entrants joined up since the beginning of the year but I am not sure if any of them came from the North. I will check the details and let the Deputy know the position.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	577	A draft integrated personnel management system, or IPMS, has been prepared by the military authorities and is being considered by the Department's civil-military strategic management committee. The IPMS will encompass a new career development plan.The requirements which the IPMS must meet are set out in chapter 4.5 of the White Paper on Defence. The focus is on ensuring the availability of military personnel with the appropriate skills to undertake whatever tasks the State requires. In this regard, the IPMS will try to ensure that personnel policies and practices keep pace with current best practice to the benefit of the organisation and of the people in it.In simple terms, the IPMS will deal with the broad range of personnel and human resource management and development issues. These include manpower policy and planning, equality of opportunity and treatment and the right to dignity at work, recruitment, terms of enlistment, induction, training education and development, physical and medical fitness, career guidance management and development, promotion, the regulatory framework, retirement and pensions. Within that broad context, it is intended that there would be a career development plan for all Defence Forces personnel. It is important to note that the issues which the IPMS must address are complex and the details, including the details of the career development plan, have yet to be finalised and agreed.I do not want anything I say to pre-empt the discussions taking place in the strategic management committee. However, I can say in a general  way that a career development plan would seek to ensure that people joining the Defence Forces are aware of the career opportunities available to them and are also aware of the standards to be reached and maintained. The plan would be designed to give all personnel the right blend of skills training, education, work assignments and experience to equip them to carry out their tasks, enhance the quality of their work life and enable them to compete for promotion opportunities. There would be an updated performance management system and performance appraisal and feedback which would have an appropriate element of career guidance and management built into it. All personnel, Army, Naval Service and Air Corps, whether officers or enlisted personnel, would be covered by the plan.As I mentioned already, the IPMS is being discussed by the strategic management committee. Once these discussions are completed, I expect that a final draft of the IPMS will be submitted to me. Before any final decisions are taken, it is my intention that the Defence Forces representative associations will be fully consulted in a spirit of partnership in accordance with the system of representation. I hope to see the IPMS, including career development planning, finalised later this year.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	578	Obviously this has major implications for the morale of members of the Defence Forces. Given the personal nature of the scheme and the possibilities and opportunities which will arise for each member from the educational and promotional point of view, what is the timescale in this regard? What the Minister has said is of major importance to each member of the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps, Naval Service and so on. Members will have an opportunity to improve their position, whether in education or whatever, but when will this happen? The Minister said that the issue is being discussed but can he give any timescale in this regard? While I fully support the idea, I need to be able to tell Defence Forces members in Kildare when it will happen.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	579	When I launched the White Paper on Defence, I anticipated that we would be further advanced than is the case, even though intensive work is currently taking place to bring the matter to a fruitful conclusion. I dislike giving timescales. The most important aspect is not the timing but that the measure is correct, has lasting power, will be effective, well understood and will make a difference. While it is the outcome I want to achieve, I will be disappointed if the scheme is not completed by this time next year. I will certainly do my best to ensure that happens.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	580	I am advised that the Defence Forces have conducted studies and technical trials with a view to considering the requirement to replace the Browning 9mm semi-automatic pistol which is currently in service. The concept of a personal defence weapon such as a pistol is undergoing a radical reappraisal from a military perspective. New calibre weapons are currently being designed with a requirement to provide protection for an individual for up to 50 metres away.However, the Defence Forces are in the position that this requirement may be met with a short barrel version of the Steyr rifle currently in service and, therefore, a new personal defence weapon programme may not be necessary. Due to ongoing developments, it has been decided by the military authorities to defer a replacement programme until a common industry approach evolves with respect to newer systems under development and the full potential for the use of the short barrel Steyr rifle is developed.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	581	It could be argued that this is a method of reducing expenses in the Defence Forces. If our Defence Forces personnel are serving overseas, does having this type of weapon indicate that they are way behind developments in the defence forces of other countries? When will the decision in this regard be made or is the current weapon considered appropriate and acceptable internationally as a defence weapon for our Defence Force personnel, who have done so well in representing our Army and this country? Deputy McGinley referred earlier to the age of these weapons. Is something being done in regard to that?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	582	When Deputy McGinley and I were talking earlier, Deputy McGinley was shooting from the hip. The position is not as Deputy Wall suggests. Overall, we put all programmes under scrutiny, as we should. From time to time decisions are taken to develop a particular programme but technology changes and innovations occur and these must be examined. That is what is happening here. In the meantime, we are at no disadvantage. The equipment is perfectly operative. We do not want to see the use of these guns, nor do we want people to be put in a position where they have to use them. Thank heavens, it is not a big feature of our United Nations work. Otherwise, we would have many more problems on our hands.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Does the Minister not agree that a programme adopted to replace the pistols has been cancelled or deferred? The pistols are 40 years old and need to be replaced. What is the estimated saving as a result of this deferral?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	584	This is not a saving. Our Estimates provide for spending millions on equip ment and improving accommodation for the Defence Forces so this is insignificant in that context. In this case the military hierarchy is looking anew at its requirements and the changes that have taken place therein. It has nothing to do with a cutback. The Defence Forces are right. If there is further use for its existing resources in this area, as there is, and if new changes are coming, it would be nonsense to go forward with a programme which would be premature in terms of what is available. All our work and Estimates are subject to that type of analysis. One can spend or intend to spend in one area and change one's mind because one intends to do something else. I hope everybody would do that when it is not necessary to spend it in a certain area.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	586	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."This afternoon I have the privilege to present to the House and open the debate on this innov ative legislation on police co-operation on this island. The introduction of this Bill is timely, having regard to the events taking place in Northern Ireland. It is a key measure towards implementing the policing principles contained in the Good Friday Agreement. The Bill completed its passage through the Seanad on 9 April.The Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill 2003 is a firm indication of the real progress made in relation to North-South co-operation on policing matters and is an important milestone in the implementation of the Patten report. It represents a step forward into a new age and creates a formalised link between the Garda Síochana and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, which will bring benefits to both jurisdictions in the form of improved effectiveness in crime prevention and detection.The Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill is grounded in the agreement between Ireland and the UK on police co-operation which was signed in Belfast on 29 April 2002. The full text of that agreement is contained in the Schedule to the Bill and I will take this opportunity to expand a little on the historical background to the agreement which is set out in its preamble. The independent commission on policing for Northern ireland was set up pursuant to the Good Friday Agreement signed in Belfast in April 1998. That commission produced its report, known as the Patten report, in September 1999. The Patten report contained 175 recommendations. Nine of these related specifically to co-operation with the Garda Síochána and a further recommendation was that the community balance at more senior ranks in the police service should be addressed by lateral entry from other police services.Members of the House will recall that the Patten report led to much debate in Northern Ireland and in these islands generally. There were discussions between the two Governments in Weston Park in July 2001, which I attended as Attorney General, which led to the publication of an updated implementation plan for the Patten report in August 2001. The intergovernmental agreement which provides the basis for this Bill provides the legal framework for the implementation of certain Patten recommendations in so far as they involve the Garda Síochána, as well as providing for ongoing enhancement of police co-operation.While there has always been a comprehensive level of co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI, this co-operation has been enhanced in recent years. Closer communication and co-operation between our police services can only improve the effectiveness of cross-Border policing in the fight against terrorism, drugs, smuggling and other organised crime. It will directly assist in crime prevention and detection.The intergovernmental agreement on which the Bill is based provides for three levels of personnel "exchange". Under Article 1, members of  each police service are to be eligible to apply for certain posts in the other police service. Under Article 2, a programme is to be put in place to enable members of each police service to be seconded with full police powers to the other police service for periods not exceeding three years and under Article 5, a programme of placements is to be put in place to enable the transfer of experience and expertise, including in the area of training.A five sided group was established at an early stage to oversee the process of implementing these articles. Senior figures from the Garda Síochána, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Policing Board for Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Office and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been meeting on a regular basis to progress the various issues involved. The full implementation of the different categories of personnel exchange provided for in the agreement required detailed negotiation involving all relevant parties on a number of issues.This Bill provides for the implementation of Articles 1 and 2 of the intergovernmental agreement. The programme of placements provided for in Article 5 does not have any legislative implications as officers participating in that programme will not be exercising any police powers in the other jurisdiction. A formal protocol on these placements will be signed by the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable as soon as consultations with the Garda associations are finalised. Pending the signing of the formal protocol to provide for the placements, I am pleased to say that informal measures have already been initiated in this area and placements have taken place involving experts in police training.Before outlining the provisions of the Bill concerning Articles 1 and 2 of the agreement, let me briefly touch on what is happening regarding other provisions of that agreement. I welcome the ongoing strengthening of co-operation between the two services which is exemplified in the holding of the first annual conference in our National Garda Training College in March last year. The convening of annual conferences between the Garda and the PSNI is provided for in article 4 of the intergovernmental agreement and a follow-up conference is planned for later this year. I was also present at the Garda Representative Association annual conference and I was glad to see the representative associations on this island are also putting in place new ways to get together more frequently.Work is under way in joint emergency planning under Article 8 of the agreement in the form of a joint Garda Síochána-PSNI major disaster project. As part of a European Union Oisín project, co-funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a joint practical exercise will take place during 2003 on the Border involving the Garda Síochána and the PSNI. This practical exercise will simulate a disaster and responses by the appropriate agencies from the two juris dictions will be observed and analysed by experts from participating EU member states.Article 9 of the intergovernmental agreement provides for measures to be taken to facilitate joint investigations between the Garda and the PSNI having regard to EU developments in this area. In this regard, I am also pleased to inform Deputies that Second Stage of Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill is being debated in the Seanad. The purpose of that Bill is to give effect to the requirements of an EU Council framework decision. It provides for the setting up of joint investigation teams by mutual consent of member states for a specific purpose and limited period. The teams will carry out criminal investigations with a cross-border dimension in one or more of the member states setting up the team. Effective co-operation is of increasing importance in our efforts to combat transnational crime. Law enforcement agencies must actively implement measures agreed by Governments to ensure boundaries do not militate against effective co-operation. The establishment and operation of joint investigation teams represents such a measure.The provisions of the EU framework decision interact with a number of the recommendations in the Patten report on policing in Northern Ireland – such as that the PSNI and the Garda Síochána should have written protocols covering key aspects of co-operation, that there should be a programme of long-term personnel exchanges between them in specialist areas, to which I have referred previously, and that consideration be given to establishing a provision for an immediate exchange of officers and pooling of investigative teams after major incidents with a substantial cross-Border dimension.Returning to the Bill before the House, it builds on the co-operation to which I have referred and gives a legal basis and framework for a more enhanced and structured co-operation between the two police services by providing that personnel from one police service may move and work in the other police service in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the intergovernmental agreement. Specifically, the Bill provides that members of the PSNI may be appointed permanently to the Garda Síochána above the rank of inspector and that members of the Garda Síochána may be seconded to the PSNI, and vice versa, with full police powers for a period of up to three years. I should also mention that the UK Government will be putting the necessary arrangements in place to allow members of the Garda Síochána compete for positions above the rank of inspector in the PSNI.I mentioned at the outset that there was a novel aspect to this legislation on which I would like to focus. Since 1925 there has been only one police service in this State and there has never been any special provision for a member of another police service to join the Garda. We have experience of gardaí participating in police peacekeeping missions abroad with the United Nations,  but they have always remained part of the Garda organisation and subject to the direction and control of the Garda Commissioner.Occasionally, members of the Garda Síochána have gone to work with international organisations such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia pursuing war crimes in the Balkans. In those cases the members resigned with an option to reapply to the Garda when they had completed their work.The idea of transfers between police services is not such a new concept for the police in Northern Ireland. There are over 40 police services in the United Kingdom with broadly similar terms and conditions of service and well established arrangements for transfers and secondments. However, what is new for the PSNI is the concept of exchanges with a police service from an outside jurisdiction. From both our perspectives, therefore, the movement of personnel between the Garda and the Police Service of Northern Ireland provided for in this Bill is unprecedented.Before discussing the specific details of the Bill, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge before the House the commitment of the Garda Commissioner and the current and previous Chief Constables of the PSNI, and the positive involvement of both their services in this process. The new relationship between the two police services on the island will provide extended opportunities for police officers in both services as well as enhancing the safety of all of the people of Ireland.I also wish to acknowledge the role which the Garda associations have played in this process to date. We should not forget that the success or failure of the proposed personnel exchanges will depend on the individual members of the respective police services. These personnel exchanges will be on a voluntary basis so it is important that the associations representing the police are positively engaged in the process. My officials, together with Garda management, have held informal briefing sessions with the four Garda representative associations to keep them abreast of developments in this area and will engage in a detailed consultative process with them.Turning now to the detail of the Bill before the House, I would like to say that it serves two essential purposes. First, it provides for members of the PSNI to be appointed permanently to the Garda Síochána above the rank of inspector and, second, it provides for the secondment of members of the Garda Síochána to the PSNI, and vice versa, with full police powers for a period of up to three years. It also provides for a new disciplinary framework to deal with the secondments to and from the Garda Síochána.Section 2 provides that the Government may appoint members of the PSNI to specified ranks in the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, as is provided for in the intergovernmental agreement. For this to happen, eligible members of the PSNI will have to compete in a merit-based selection procedure with  Garda Síochána applicants for appointment to the ranks in the Garda Síochána concerned. The extent to which each such rank will be opened up to competition can be varied by regulation under the Bill.The implementation of this section will mean that members of the PSNI will be enabled to move to the Garda Síochána on a permanent basis. We will be encouraging Garda members to apply for posts in the PSNI but it is very much a decision for the individuals in question. I would hope that the programme of placements and secondments referred to above will facilitate an improved understanding and appreciation between the two police services and so overcome any reluctance to apply for a permanent post in the other organisation.Section 3 provides for the secondment of members of the PSNI to the Garda Síochána with full Garda powers for a period not exceeding three years. Secondees will continue to be paid by the PSNI but will be under the direction and control of the Garda Commissioner and have the powers, rights, duties and obligations of a member of the Garda Síochána of the rank to which they are appointed. A secondment under this section may be terminated by the Commissioner or the Government, where it made the appointment. The ranks in the Garda Síochána to which members may be appointed under this section and the number to be so appointed may be prescribed by regulation under the Bill. The section also makes certain technical amendments to the Garda Síochána Acts to reflect the position of secondees.Section 4 provides for secondments from the Garda Síochána to the PSNI with full police powers for a period not exceeding three years. Secondees will continue to be paid as members of the Garda Síochána but shall not be subject to the direction or control of the Garda Commissioner or be entitled to exercise in the State any Garda powers. Secondees shall continue to be entitled to claim compensation under the Garda Compensation Acts 1941 and 1945 and their service on secondment shall be regarded as service with the Garda Síochána for pension, promotion and seniority purposes. The number and rank of members of the Garda Síochána who may be seconded under this section may be prescribed by regulation under the Bill.The type of secondments provided for in sections 3 and 4 provide a mechanism whereby Garda members, who do not wish to leave the Garda Síochána, can make their experience and expertise available to the PSNI for an extended period of up to three years. It also allows for PSNI officers to be seconded to the Garda Síochána and hopefully we will see a two-way flow, enhancing policing standards in both organisations.Section 5 provides for the procedures which will apply regarding breaches of discipline by a member of the Garda Síochána who is seconded  to the PSNI. A standalone disciplinary framework is provided in this regard whereby the investigation of any alleged breach of discipline by a seconded member of the Garda Síochána is carried out under the law and procedure applicable to the investigation of breaches of discipline by members of the PSNI. Any appeal against or request for review of a finding of that disciplinary process is also made under the law and procedure applicable in Northern Ireland. However, no disciplinary action may be taken against a seconded member of the Garda Síochána by the Chief Constable of the PSNI. Instead, the findings of a disciplinary investigation or the outcome of an appeal or review of such findings will be transmitted to the Garda Commissioner, or the Government in respect of gardaí above the rank of inspector, for whatever action is deemed appropriate. The disciplinary action which may be taken by the Commissioner or the Government under this section is defined. A member of the Garda Síochána whose secondment to the PSNI has expired or been terminated will be obliged to co-operate with any such investigation as if he or she were a member of the PSNI and any failure to do so shall itself constitute a breach of discipline.Section 6 provides for the procedures which will apply regarding breaches of discipline by a member of the PSNI who is seconded to the Garda Síochána. Similar to the approach taken in section 5, the investigation of any alleged breach of discipline by a seconded member of the PSNI will be carried out in accordance with the Garda Síochána disciplinary regulations or, as may be the case, the Garda Síochána Complaints Board procedures. Any appeals or requests for review of the findings will also be determined within that process. No disciplinary action will be taken by the Garda Commissioner against a PSNI secondee. Instead, the findings of the disciplinary process will be transmitted by the Garda Commissioner to the Chief Constable for whatever action is deemed appropriate. Section 7 provides for the making of regulations for the purpose of giving full effect to the provisions of the Bill.These represent the key elements of the Bill. The Bill contains certain other procedural provisions as well as consequential amendments to a number of Acts to which I could also refer. However, I am conscious that I have already spoken at length and that there will be the opportunity to deal with any queries Deputies may have regarding those provisions in my reply or on Committee Stage. I hope that what I have said will assist the House in its task of considering the Bill.The Bill further strengthens the relationship between the two police services on the island. It will provide extended opportunities for police officers in both services and enhance the safety of all of the people of Ireland. In addition, and  most importantly, the enactment of this legislation is a key measure towards implementing the policing principles contained in the Good Friday Agreement and the Patten report, particularly regarding improving the level of cross-community confidence in the impartiality of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. It is further evidence of the determination of both Governments to continue to make progress in implementing the Good Friday Agreement.I should add that the issue of enhancing North-South co-operation was also addressed in the Joint Declaration issued by the Irish and British Governments on 1 May last. In that declaration, we gave a commitment that, "further progress towards normal policing will also include the prompt enactment of the necessary legislation by both Governments to allow for lateral entry and secondments."The Joint Declaration is part of an overall package which we have described as acts of completion. When briefing the House last week on the latest developments in the peace process, both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, reported that, despite considerable progress and advances across a range of issues in the recent talks, it has not proved possible at this point to achieve a final agreement on all outstanding issues regarding the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. However, the two Governments have agreed that those aspects of the Joint Declaration which are not contingent on acts of completion by others will now be taken forward. The Joint Declaration which is our template for the full implementation of the Agreement is now also the shared agenda for action between the two Governments. We are committed to doing all within our power to make rapid progress in the areas it covers. The issues addressed by this Bill fall into this category and can be taken forward with the approval of this House.It is in that spirit that I commend the Bill to the House.

Fine Gael will be supporting this legislation. As the Minister has explained it implements the recommendations of the Patten report on cross-Border police co-operation. Members of each police service will now be eligible to apply for certain posts in the other police service and there will be a programme for members of each police service to be seconded with full police powers to the other police service for periods not exceeding three years.It would be difficult for Fine Gael not to support this Bill. Its broad concept was shaped by the then leader of Fine Gael, Garret FitzGerald, 21 years ago. He came up with the idea of closer ties with the law enforcement agencies in the North in the early 1980s. At the time he explained  that an all-Ireland policing system would ensure that people who had committed crimes could not evade arrest and conviction by passing rapidly across the Border from one jurisdiction to another. At the time he explained that it was a complex idea and without international precedent but he pushed it and felt it was the right thing to do. He went on to say that we should be looking for a structure, however novel, that would enable the people of Ireland to tackle together things that could not be done as well separately, and how right he was. Fianna Fáil played the green card. Garret FitzGerald was taking an honest, constructive approach on the serious paramilitary threat that confronted Ireland.It was unfortunate that at the time Fianna Fáil played politics with the idea and the political notion was that if Garret FitzGerald had his way, the RUC would be policing the streets of Cork, Kerry, Waterford and Dublin 4, and it was conveyed skilfully, politically speaking. It was effective. He was accused of collusion with the British Government, of being a puppet and of conspiring with British spy masters at the time. Some people may recall the debate between the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and Garret FitzGerald in 1982. Charles Haughey started it and accused Garret FitzGerald of creating a British-Irish police force. Dr. FitzGerald retorted by pushing forward his policy document and asking Charles Haughey to pick out one instance where that was cited. Mr. Haughey backed down at that point. It was a pity that Fianna Fáil had to play politics at that time because it is probably the case that had it not done so, lives would have been saved. Here we are 21 years later and a Fianna Fáil Government is introducing that same concept and notion that Dr. FitzGerald bravely put forward.

Some Members will vote against this for their own reasons. We do not have any option but to take this approach with regard to the security of the State. It is still the case that we have dissident republican groups who remain active, and that organised crime throughout Europe is growing. The Government should reconsider this idea of an organised crime unit. Garda sergeants and inspectors have put it to the Minister. If he is not going to do that it is incumbent upon us to create closer ties with police forces in different jurisdictions. Last year some senior officers met at a conference to discuss the exploitation of borders or frontiers by organised  crime networks. Assistant Garda Commissioner Kevin Carthy stated very simply that the police are required to stop at borders, but the criminals are not and exploit that weakness. The shortcomings in co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda Síochána came to light in the post mortem of policing activities surrounding the Omagh bombing.A report was commissioned by the University of Limerick and the University of Ulster, the findings of which were fairly damning. It concluded that the failure to form joint investigative teams was brought into sharper focus by the events in Omagh in 1998. I know that the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003 was in the Seanad yesterday. We need to push the matter forward, and it is something that we can support absolutely. The report went on to state that the investigation that followed the bombing was limited to parallel investigations on both sides of the Border rather than employing any kind of joint investigative team. It exposed the superficial nature of co-operation, where serious legislative and procedural barriers had been largely neglected in the hope that informal, ad hoc police co-operation would suffice. If we wish to avoid another Omagh, we must pass legislation and move on initiatives such as this.Another major finding in the report was that the police forces on either side of the Border had no joint disaster plan. We are now more conscious of global terrorism, and the question of Sellafield has come up again and again, as has the possibility of strikes against chemical plants. Once again, we must get the two police forces working together on this.Under this legislation, gardaí will be able to apply for senior PSNI jobs and vice versa. It is conceivable that, at some future date, the Garda Commissioner will come from the North. Would that not be something? There has not been a bar on that since 1925, but the Bill would certainly make its occurrence far more likely. At present the Garda Síochána and the PSNI can second officers or agree long-term personnel exchanges, but their officers do not have constabulary powers, and the legislation will correct that.We can examine some practical examples of co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda. Such co-operation happened recently between the A1 and the M1, one of the most dangerous stretches of road on the island. The PSNI and the Garda have been working together in an attempt to reduce accidents on that route, and those kinds of initiatives can be very effective. It was interesting to read recently that the US Congress House Committee on International Relations had framed legislation that, if passed by Congress, would allow funding to go to the PSNI and the Garda Síochána for human rights and computer training. It is a State Department authorisation  Bill to foster greater co-operation and communication between the two police forces. That the Americans have identified that they would like to be able to assist in such initiatives and endeavours is very positive.Both my grandfathers were in the old IRA. One was from west Cork, and he was not terribly vocal about his time in the War of Independence. I recall my grandmother telling us about his tangles with RIC officers. He later went on to become a garda sergeant and was shot at by the new IRA, but I suppose that is another story. People such as my grandfather would welcome this Bill and would like to see this co-operation happening. Senator Maurice Hayes was right when he said in the Seanad that this is a new beginning. He is also correct to say that the two police forces' level of respect for each other has moved on. I understand why one Member of the Seanad might suggest that the Bill be delayed because of question marks over members of the PSNI, but the issue is much bigger than that. I remind him too that we have some beauties in our own police force. It is not a question of whether we should support this legislation for, if we wish to save our nation, we must do so. It was Garret FitzGerald who bravely advocated this concept more than 20 years ago – better late than never.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	593	I, too, welcome the Bill as a further step in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. As one who lives within a few miles of the Border and has served that area, not only in my days in this House but previously in agriculture, I know better than most that things do not simply stop at the Border. I have seen the Border spiked and parts of it blown up, and I have also seen some of the biggest bombs ever used in Northern Ireland carried across open fields in the dark of night. The Border is not like the Berlin Wall, it is a very open frontier. Under EU rules, it is now open economically too.I remember, way back in the early 70s when we were discussing EU entry, talking to a very affable Sinn Féin councillor about prospects under EU rule and saying that if we all worked together, the Border might in time disappear so that we might all come to live and work together. His retort at that stage was to ask who would get the thanks for it. Thank God we have come a long way since then, but many lives have been lost in the meantime. I welcome the concept that the Garda and PSNI members should be able to work within each other's forces in a legitimate manner. I also welcome increased involvement between the two forces. Unfortunately, I did not hear the Minister's full speech, but that is my fault rather than his.As Deputy Deasy said, we want to see much more involvement between the two forces in ordinary routine matters such as the traffic corps, for  example, on the Newtownbutler Road crossing the Border near Clones. Personnel on that road have very often contacted public representatives to complain that they can never enforce speed limits there since, if gardaí try to follow someone breaking the speed limit out of the town, the person has crossed over the Border before they have any chance of getting control of the situation.Those are the kinds of simple things that could save lives. Anyone who drives along the M1, M2 or M3 at around 60 miles an hour and sees a car flash by them quickly realises that it has a Northern Ireland number plate. We must rectify that matter if we are serious about saving lives and controlling traffic, for we have seen some horrific accidents, perhaps not directly involving people from Northern Ireland, but often caused by them. I am not saying that those south of the Border are great drivers or those north of the Border bad, for the opposite happens too. When some people drive through the North, they try to be less subservient.There is also the issue of drugs control. I remind Members that, when John Bruton was Taoiseach during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, he turned the need to control drug-trafficking into an important issue. If we are to deal with this and other issues on this island, we must have a high level of co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda Síochána.I would like to return to the foundation of the PSNI. Obviously, people have reason to be genuinely worried, especially in the light of all the recent revelations. We must realise that it is a new force. There may be old personnel therein but it is under new control. That a person from a different force in the UK is now the head of the PSNI is a breath of fresh air.I congratulate the Official Unionists and the SDLP on getting dug into that new body and trying to work from the inside to ensure the PSNI worked in a proper way. I urge Sinn Féin to do likewise. If the Agreement is to work we have to take the difficult decisions. Sometimes it is easier to hurl on the ditch than to get inside and work. Looking at the recent applications for recruitment to the PSNI I was amazed so many Catholics were prepared to apply in light of the background situation and all the difficulties involved. It can become a much more impartial force than heretofore. With the Garda Síochána and the PSNI working together over the three years, or whatever period the Agreement allows, minds can broaden and attitudes can change.Organised crime is still a major issue. One way to beat organised crime is to have people in the forces from different backgrounds. This will allow easier access to information and ensure such crime is brought to an end or to as low a level as possible. As one who was on the scene as quickly as possible after the Omagh bombing to see what could be done, I realise the seriousness of the sit uation. It was not just the deaths but the trauma and the horror for everybody concerned, from the children to the grandmothers, from the members of the police forces to the private citizens. Had there been closer co-operation between the two forces at that time we could have people under lock and key now. There is no doubt there are some people who know, and did know from the first day, who was responsible for that desperate horror. There are people in Omagh who will always carry the scars and who need to know that the police forces of this island are working together to ensure those criminals are apprehended and controlled. If not, there is no guarantee that some other splinter group will not act again, tomorrow or some other day. This is a matter about which we must be careful.As one who has supported the Good Friday Agreement from the outset, my support goes back to the Anglo-Irish Agreement when Dr. Garret FitzGerald was carrying the flag. There was criticism that he was selling us down the drain. Some of the people from minority religions, south of the Border, were sore that he did what he did and have never forgiven him for it. However, it moved the situation forward. Each Taoiseach since then has played a role in some small way to move that whole issue forward to where we are today. Nobody wants to go back to the bad old days of the deaths of in excess of 3,000 people and the thousands of others who died indirectly as a result of the pressures and trauma from cancer etc.There were two main chapters of the Agreement in which I had a major interest, those on the release of prisoners and decommissioning. I am happy enough at this stage that the prisoners were released although it was very difficult to say to a person whose brother had been murdered at his place of worship that it was right that the prisoner should be released. However, that happened and people have come to live with it through time.The issue of decommissioning has not been fully dealt with. I urge those who have control over it on both sides of the divide – the hardline Protestant groups and the IRA – to come to the table at this late stage to ensure that not only does this policing Bill do its aspect of the job of finalising the Good Friday Agreement but that the total Agreement can be seen to actually work. If we are to lead the way in international affairs, for which we have received much publicity, and show others how to deal with similar traumas and problems, it is vital that we finalise it. Nothing is finished until the last issue is dealt with.We are dealing with the policing issue, on which I congratulate the Minister. I congratulate him also on his ongoing work and that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach and all others who are in favour of the Agreement. For God's sake, let those who have issues to  finalise on either side get on with the job and finalise them in the same spirit as we are doing today.Over the years I have received various items in the post regarding my activities, including telephone calls suggesting I was not behaving myself in a way that was deemed proper by some of these organisations. I received a card the other day asking me if I was ashamed of myself and if I would condemn this, that and the other. I take serious exception to it because it was not properly signed but had a scrawl at the bottom and said that I condemned republicanism. As a member of a republican party, I have never condemned republicanism. I have condemned criminal activities and do not apologise for that. There are people who refused to condemn the murders and the catastrophes down through the years and recently condemned fairly minor issues regarding paint etc. I want to make it absolutely clear that I condemn murder from whatever side it comes. I do not carry any can for loyalists, Unionists, IRA-Sinn Féin or anybody else. Anyone who goes out and takes the life of another in the name of this country, as a terrorist, does not deserve any congratulations or roses. The only way this country will be united is through people sitting down together acting in a constructive, compassionate way, trying to understand each other's problems. There are still many problems in Northern Ireland and in this country. I say to those people who are afraid to sign their names to letters to stand up and be counted, to take a stand on behalf of this island home of ours and ensure those who deserve condemnation are condemned and those who deserve congratulations for their work towards peace on this island and the successful police force, be it the Garda Síochána or the PSNI, are congratulated. I will continue to do this in whatever way I can.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I, too, support this legislation. The establishment of formal links, ties and co-operation with another police force on this island is a milestone. It is a unique development that members of the Garda Síochána may be seconded to serve under the Chief Constable of the PSNI, with all the rights, duties and powers being exercised by him in another jurisdiction. The only difference is that pay and pension conditions will remain in this jurisdiction, and vice versa in respect of members of the PSNI serving under the Garda Síochána in the Republic.It is also a unique development in terms of fulfilling what was envisaged at the start of the peace process and the implementation of the structures agreed in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Following the establishment of the independent policing commission, chaired by Chris Patten, and the subsequent Patten report, very important decisions were taken on the basis that  unless the questions of security and policing were correctly addressed it would be very difficult to maintain a successful peace process.The Good Friday Agreement refers to North-South co-operation and the development of North-South bodies. The Bill is the ultimate manifestation of progress in this area. The Weston Park discussions and the intergovernmental agreement between this country and United Kingdom last year made specific provision for the appointment and secondment of members of the PSNI and the Garda Síochána. The Bill is the legislative outcome of these developments.The Minister referred to the discussions on 1 May regarding acts of completion. The strand of policing which began in 1998 has continued in all of the major intergovernmental meetings. Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill was debated in the Seanad yesterday. The Bill envisages a similar type of co-operation, not necessarily with the same structures, in the European Union to deal with matters such as trans-national and cross-border activities in dealing with criminal offences.The question of structures is very important in the process of implementing what was agreed on Good Friday 1998. It is important that all of the areas covered are addressed. Progress has been made on political matters in terms of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body and North-South co-operation. Progress has also been made in economic areas in terms of cross-Border co-operative activities. Various Departments are now co-operating strongly. There is also co-operation on social, educational and cultural activities.Last, but by no means least, there is co-operation on the question of policing, probably one of the most crucial areas for co-operation. Unless a community is prepared to accept a police body in which all traditions feel they are represented, outstanding problems will not be resolved and will continue to fester. That is the nub of the problem at present.The macro situation has been addressed in that many of the required structures have been put in place. However, there continues to be considerable community unrest and an absence of full acceptance of the existing police force in the North, the PSNI. There is also a considerable degree of paramilitary activity on both sides of the divide. There continues to be a high rate of punishment beatings with sections of the community continuing to take the law into their own hands. In addition, certain other activities continue, including smuggling, drug pushing and trafficking and cross-Border activities contrary to the kind envisaged by this legislation.Such activities cannot be tolerated in a peace process if that process is to be meaningful. There cannot be an independent army or police force and there must be an acceptance of structures in which people will participate. It is an integral part  of the peace process that this be done. It will involve pain on a number of sides, but all steps must be taken to ensure it is done.It is a shame that the Assembly elections have had to be postponed twice. Democracy cannot wait. In this regard the Government and the SDLP rightly opposed the postponement of the elections. They cannot be postponed at the behest of one political party which does not consider that the time is right to hold them. Once this begins to happen it indicates a lack of confidence in the structures that have been established. It is wrong when it appears that one political party in the North has greater influence than others over the British Government and that the British Government should take greater note of its views than those expressed by the Irish Government or the major parties of the other tradition.Close links have existed in the past between the RUC and the British Army and military intelligence, including MI5 and MI6. Recent revelations indicate the extent of the involvement by the RUC in paramilitary organisations and informers and the degree to which that activity was a licence to kill. That must leave a major question mark over a police force. When such revelations surface, a suffering community will always begin to believe the worst and feel that the police force cannot be trusted.Questions have also arisen regarding informers within the Garda ranks who seem to have a licence to import drugs because they say their Garda handlers knew about it. Such practices cannot be tolerated in any police force, certainly not where an informer has a licence to kill simply to protect sources. Such issues have arisen in connection with the recent reports on the Stakeknife issue and the Pat Finucane killing. Questions on the degree of involvement by the police force have raised concerns about credibility which will justify those who dig in their heels and refuse to join the PSNI on the basis that they still do not know the extent of the residue of these connections.We have still not been given answers in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in respect of which there have been allegations of considerable collusion between paramilitaries and British intelligence. It is nearly 30 years since perhaps the worst atrocity of the troubles took place and its anniversary is coming up this week. All sorts of allegations have been made with regard to the murky business of Omagh and the failure to make information available due to the manner in which intelligence services operated. These matters could delay the process of achieving cross-Border police co-operation.I hope we can put that aside and accept this legislation in the spirit in which it is brought to us. It is a coherent and integral part of the Good Friday Agreement. The Patten report has been valuable and the decision to establish a police  authority was extremely important. We have seen how the authority has operated in Northern Ireland with considerable input from elected representatives. Transparency and effective control by elected representatives has been introduced. The same principle extends to the operation of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in respect of which there is a degree of accountability at local level by local authorities. It is important to have this principle of drip-down accountability in any police force in the country. With the establishment of the independent ombudsman we have a body and a structure which can hold the police force accountable.The package of proposals for the new police force in Northern Ireland is second to none and I would welcome the introduction of such a package here. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform says he will do great things in that regard and I would like to see similar mechanisms introduced in terms of structures and the level of accountability and transparency. An independent policing commission made the proposals and I give my full support to their implementation throughout the island. We should examine the matter carefully.To get down to the nitty gritty, one of the proposals in the legislation before the House seeks to address disciplinary matters. The process is cumbersome since the Minister seeks to give to the Chief Constable powers of authority over people who are seconded to serve in the police force in Northern Ireland, without ceding the power to discipline. Powers of investigation into disciplinary matters are given, but powers of action to implement disciplinary proceedings are not. If similar disciplinary mechanisms and an ombudsman were in place, if we got rid of the outdated Garda complaints mechanism and took on board the complaints mechanism in Northern Ireland, we could get rid of the cumbersome provisions of the Bill which raise all sorts of problems. What will happen if someone is investigated within six months of taking up a position and is found to be in breach of discipline? The law says we will approve of recommendations, but nothing can be done until the term, perhaps three years, of the secondment is over. Will such a person be given full permission to serve in the force even though he or she has been investigated and found wanting?We need a tighter provision in respect of discipline and the two police forces must co-operate in that regard. If we could bring forward some provisions of the Garda Bill the Minister has spoken of, we could eliminate some of the cumbersome elements of the provisions in this Bill. We do not know what is in the proposed legislation, but we hope for great things.What are the provisions in respect of firearms? The Garda is an unarmed force and it is not part of its code of conduct or operations to carry  weapons as a matter of course. The PSNI is an armed body. Presumably, an officer coming from the Northern jurisdiction would be subject to our unarmed code which implies that gardaí who have sworn an oath to uphold the law without arms will be armed for the duration of their service in Northern Ireland. Will they receive training in the use of weapons? If so, it will represent a sea change in their service. Again, the Bill is silent on a matter which changes dramatically the nature of policing carried out by members of the Garda.The provision which allows members of each force above the rank of inspector to apply for positions in the ranks of the other is important. I hope it will represent a valuable levelling process of bringing people who have achieved a certain level of seniority in one force into the other. It will enable such people to bring their skills in a particular method of policing to the other force with beneficial operational effects. It is to be hoped that in the long-term the culture of unarmed activity which has operated in this jurisdiction since the foundation of the State comes to the fore and results in an unarmed police force in Northern Ireland also.There have already been a number of co-operative activities. We have mentioned before the football match which took place in Parnell Park and the first annual conference in Templemore between the Garda and the PSNI. Far more serious levels of co-operation are necessary. A significant amount of criminal activity is taking place in both parts of this island, some of which is terrorist related and some of which is drug related. The co-operation of police forces in both jurisdictions is of particular importance in addressing these matters. Credibility is the most important thing of all in a police force. Being able to see uniformed police on the streets, who are easily identifiable and have the confidence of the community, is the way forward in all circumstances. We must recognise that neither crime nor criminals recognise borders. Likewise, police co-operation, whether it is between Northern Ireland and the Republic or between Ireland and any number of EU countries, should be as strong as possible. As an island, Ireland is vulnerable to crime from outside the State along its huge border with the sea as well as that between North and South.Therefore, a co-operative approach is extremely important and, whether we like it or not, we must have a police service in Northern Ireland which is accepted as part of the structures that arise from the Good Friday Agreement. Some groups may not be able to accept it at present but it is inevitable. If it is not accepted, the Good Friday Agreement cannot be implemented because the question of security and policing is at the heart of confidence and par ticipation in the community. However, it must be seen to be representative of all of the traditions on the island and to be accountable and transparent. The levelling process that will come about from the Garda being part and parcel of the PSNI through secondment, recruitment and appointment at senior level, will assist in quelling the fears of people who are concerned about the new PSNI.I hope we pass this Bill and that we find it works well and provides co-operation to assist in the fight against crime and in bringing the peace process to its full completion.

The Green Party, North and South, supports the implementation of the measures in this Bill on an operational level. There has already been a considerable delay in bringing about the measures contained in the Bill, which is regrettable. It is annoying to hear from UK Government sources that they are not able to make as much progress as they would like in terms of reforming the Police Service of Northern Ireland due to delays they cite as being the responsibility of the Irish Government.The hope in this debate is that this Bill will see sufficient measures put in place to allow secondment to take place, rather than further delays being presented as other issues are thrown up which have not been taken into account in this legislation. I seek the Minister's reassurance that we will see the matter progressed after this Bill is passed and that it is not one of a number of Bills which still needs to be considered by way of regulations.There is no doubt that all is not well. There are many imperfections in the police services on both sides of the Border and list of serious accusations regarding collusion is outstanding. Nevertheless, many Nationalists have joined the PSNI and their courage, in the face of such unresolved issues, is to be commended and their expectations of reforms should not be dashed. It should focus the attention of both Governments on making sure that the Patten recommendations are fully implemented and that there is no break in the momentum.The spirit of the Patten report is also needed south of the Border. The Chief Constable of the PSNI made it known that he needs this legislation. He needs senior ranking officers to be seconded from other jurisdictions in order that he can carry out his work against the challenges facing him. Equal urgency needs to be brought to bear on the implementation of those recommendations south of the Border. Night after night, we hear reconstructions of the Abbeylara investi gation and it is difficult to listen to, given the loss of life that took place. There is also the issue of the regrettable and counterproductive police measures employed during the "reclaim the streets" fiasco last year, which did not enamour the police service to many civilians, and which is still unresolved. Many of the reforms need to be faced up to on both sides of the Border and, hopefully, this Bill will increase the momentum towards that.Equally, there are inconsistencies which are difficult to resolve north of the Border. The police ombudsman's position is something which is being called for south of the Border, yet here we are talking about a Garda inspectorate and the Government is telling us that it is more or less the same thing. In the eyes of the public, it is not the same thing and, unless the Garda has the full confidence of the public, we will have a problem. We should face up to the need for similar structures south as well as north of the Border in terms of the ombudsman position.We also need to come to terms with the promise of an extra 2,000 gardaí. This legislation refers to the secondment of members of the Garda Síochána to the North, as well as the other way around. Despite the lack of resources in my own constituency, in places such as Lusk and Oberstown – and I had a complaint about the lack of Garda resources in Clonmel – gardaí are on escorting duty. They are being taken away from their normal duties and one could argue we cannot spare gardaí for secondment, although we are referring to senior ranking gardaí. Nevertheless, there is a lack of resources which needs to be dealt with.Section 5 of the Bill relates to disciplinary action. Questions need to be answered regarding the time lapse between a charge of malpractice and the disciplinary action. Where do the officers stay? Do they stay where they are seconded or are they taken back? These questions may well be raised by way of amendment.The issue of collusion is even more pronounced now than it was a week ago, due to the weekend newspaper reports. There is a need to know that British military espionage in Northern Ireland has ended. That assurance must be secured from the British Government so that we can move on and ensure that all intelligence gathering is done through the police rather than the military. There is a clear and important difference in what is being said here.I hope the Government has received assurances from the British Government that it will deploy police intelligence and not military intelligence to fight crime. A debate is ongoing on in the Northern Policing Board on how sensitive information is to be dealt with. There is to be a representative sub-group to adjudicate on the sensitivity of information. Something similar is probably  needed south of the Border – Vincent Browne regularly reminds us about Seán O'Callaghan and his role. These are issues that are still in the public mind and need to be resolved.There is also a need for inquiries. We often deal with this during Taoiseach's Question Time; whether we resolve it is another matter, but we certainly air the issues of the many outstanding inquiries. There are so many inquiries now needed and demanded that the question arises of whether there should be an omnibus of inquiries. Perhaps we should move on to the South African model of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to deal with matters North and South. This Saturday is the 29th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and there are still many outstanding issues related to this.How well screened are members of both police forces? In the South, people will have questions about the PSNI and some of its long-standing members if they are to be offered secondment to the Garda Síochána. I have heard that there will be attempts to delay this matter; that members of one or other police service will hold out for pensions or other gratifications. The Government must state to us, as well as to the public, whether this matter will be dealt with through this legislation. I see similarities to the arrangement whereby members of the Garda work in Kosovo, for example. They go there, do their jobs and come back. It does not seem to affect pension rights or anything else, and it should be spelled out clearly that this is along the same lines and that there is no further need for negotiation. The legislation is badly needed and has been for a long time. We should get on with it.

It was also my hope that ordinary Irish citizens who have been to the forefront of pressing for police reform, together with Sinn Féin, could say that their daily experience of policing had changed utterly and for the better. This is not yet a reality.Dá mbeadh sin fíor, chuirfinn fáilte roimh an Bhille seo mar bheadh sé mar an chéad chéim i dtreo poilínteacht ar an dá chuid den oileán a nascadh le chéile, proiséas a theastaíonn uainn leis an an oileán seo – forsa poilínteacht amháin leis an chaighdeán is airde maidir le ceartaí daonna a chuirfeadh an dhlí i bhfeidhm ar bhunús chothrom do gach uile saoránach in Éirinn aontaithe. Cé gur mhaith le Sinn Féin tacaíocht a thabhairt do Bhille mar seo, ag an am seo ní féidir linn.The bottom line is that this measure is important, but it is entirely premature and will be seen as a distraction from the ongoing debate about the PSNI, lending respectability to it and  exonerating it, in its present and past incarnations, of its human rights abuses. It would not be appropriate for this House to enact the Bill until such time as a proper policing service is established in the Six Counties, one that, at the very least, fully reflects the Patten recommendations. Sinn Féin regards these as a compromise, an absolute minimum standard. They are not at all the ultimate guide to creating the world-class police service to which we aspire, and which Irish citizens deserve. What we have in the PSNI does not even meet the Patten threshold. Just as Sinn Féin cannot sit on the policing board for this reason, neither can we support this Bill. I urge Members not to fall into the SDLP trap of setting their sights too low and settling too soon for too little.Let us look at the implementation of the Patten report to date. The Patten commission made 175 recommendations. The Mandelson Bill of 2000 explicitly rejected 89 of those recommendations. Only 11 Patten recommendations were definitively adopted. Due to the deliberately vague and imprecise nature of this Bill and its implementation plan, it is impossible to determine the status of 75 of the recommendations. Despite subsequent amendments, the Police Act 2000 needs significant further amendment to bring it into conformity with the Patten report. The British Government has acknowledged this since the 2001 Weston Park talks.Deputies should not be confused by the fact that the SDLP broke the broad Nationalist consensus by joining the police force on foot of a still outstanding promise that the Patten report would be fully implemented. The fact that we have yet to achieve implementation of the Patten report is one reason that this Bill cannot be supported at this time. I urge Members of this House planning to support this Bill to reconsider that support in light of recent events. The British Government has not only suspended the Assembly, a democratically elected institution, but it has gone a step further in its interference in the democratic process by cancelling the elections of 29 May, in the face of overwhelming opposition expressed on both sides of this House last week. Perhaps the most important consideration, however, is the recent confirmation in the Stevens report of collusion between the RUC Special Branch and the loyalist death squads. My colleagues will deal with this in more detail later. To support this Bill at this time effectively gives endorsement to the PSNI as it now stands – a cosmetically reconstructed RUC, with the wholly discredited special branch intact, complete with serving officers who have been involved in collusion, murder and human rights abuses. This is a bridge too far.This Bill wrongly presumes that the much needed police reforms are complete. I draw Members' attention to section 2, subsections (3)  and (4) of the Bill, which set out eligibility requirements for members of the PSNI to serve with the Garda Síochána. It lists equivalent qualifications including experience and rank and specifies a merit-based selection process, but nowhere does it explicitly set out procedures for screening for past involvement in human rights abuses in the course of duty, nor indicate that eligibility will be predicated on human rights training or skills improvement. Indeed, given the history of policing in Northern Ireland, human rights training should be a minimum requirement for members of the Garda Síochána so that they may eventually serve in an acceptable policing service in the North. Not a single line of this Bill mentions human rights standards and this in itself is a fundamental flaw.There is nothing in this Bill to stop internationally discredited special branch officers from serving in this State. There is also nothing to screen out serving officers of the PSNI who are subject to investigation or legal proceedings in relation to abuse of powers. This cannot be allowed to happen and must be explicitly safeguarded against.We also believe that the passing of this legislation is fundamentally inappropriate until such time as policing and justice powers have been devolved and are no longer vested in a foreign power in a foreign country – an occupying power. Full justice and full self-determination for the people of Ireland demand bringing policing back under local democratic control and shaping it as an effective, trusted community service, not as a tool of oppression and sectarianism. At a minimum, policing and justice power must be devolved to the Assembly, the Executive and the All-Ireland Ministerial Council as an interim prerequisite.The RUC was the armed wing of unionism. It was sectarian in its make-up and nature. It was routinely involved in collusion with Unionist paramilitaries. It engaged in a shoot to kill policy, intimidated lawyers and operated within the framework of repressive emergency legislation.The Good Friday Agreement, therefore, promised a new police service that would be impartial, representative, free from partisan political control, efficient, infused with a human rights culture, decentralised and democratically accountable at all levels, but the British response was to gut Patten and to try to convince us that the PSNI is an acceptable substitute for the real change promised. It was not and is not.Five years on we still need root and branch reform of the policing and justice systems. We need the transfer of powers on policing and justice to the Assembly as an interim measure and we need effective inquiries into the murders of solicitors Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson, the Brian Nelson affair and multiple allegations of collusion between the Unionist police force and  Unionist paramilitary groups. What we do not need is premature legislation such as this Bill before the House, which will work at cross purposes to the goal of resolving the policing issue that is so important to all of us on this island. I ask even at this late stage that the Governments delay fully enacting this Bill until such time as there is movement on Patten and until we get what the Irish people voted for when they voted to accept the Good Friday Agreement.

It indicates just how far we have travelled along the road to a more peaceful co-existence when in this House we are speaking on a Bill that will provide for the implementation of co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. A few years ago this Bill would be the stuff of illusions. It would belong to the realms of "if only", yet today it is a reality. As a citizen and public representative, it is encouraging, hopeful and indicates that the future cannot only be different from the past, but perhaps it can be better. No single Bill can ensure that better future, but there are signposts on the way. This is one of them and it is pointing in the right direction.This Bill will legislatively allow that members of each police service, the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, will be eligible to apply for certain posts in the other police service and can also be seconded with full police powers to the other police service for specified periods. This is a positive and courageous move. It breaks new ground and puts flesh on the bones of the aspiration that will help to provide a more open, accessible, broadly-based and acceptable police force in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland. This legislation cannot guarantee all of those aspirations, but it is a step in that direction.In this context, we should have a Garda ombudsman in the South with powers similar to those of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. Bearing in mind the most recent serious revelations which indicate the insidious and pervasive influence of certain dark forces which governments may not always control, it is essential that the greatest care must be exercised to ensure that the placing of personnel in the police forces, North and South, does not provide an opportunity for any so-called intelligence service to cause problems and, consequently, impair the progress of the peace process.There can be mutual enhancement of the capabilities of the two police forces. For example, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, due to the particular circumstances in which it has operated, has developed expertise in certain areas. For example, in the Abbeylara situation, there was expertise available in the PSNI which might have helped to avoid the unfortunate outcome of that  situation. However, in the final analysis, the more the two police services relate to each other, and this new measure will help considerably, the greater will be the opportunity to assist each other. That is in the interest of all of the people on this island.As an Independent representative on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I have on several occasions advocated integrated education as part of an overall response to the situation in Northern Ireland, not because I know it will guarantee instant success, but as a former teacher, I believe that when young people spend time together while going about their daily business, they can reach an understanding that is valuable and they can sometimes learn to accept, and even value, difference and diversity and can recognise the truth in the maxim, "United we stand; divided we fall". Equally, the co-operation proposed in this legislation has the capability to deliver a more acceptable police service and the potential to strengthen morale by virtue of delivering a better service because ultimately for all of us as citizens an equitable, just, fair and acceptable police service is a basic requirement.I watched a video in the audio visual room of the Dáil along with 50 students from Mercy College in Sligo, my former school. This video outlines the history of the Dáil from the early 1990s and a visible thread running through it was the history of the peace process. Albert Reynolds, Dick Spring, the late Gordon Wilson, Deputy John Bruton, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the former President Clinton and the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, were some of the images on the screen and I also recognise that many others who contributed centrally to the peace process were not on that video. The words of Tony Blair still resound in my mind. He said, "We have come too far to turn back."  Indeed, we have. I believe that today we are turning a corner on that road. I commend this Bill to the House and give it my full support.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	598	One of the principal aims of the Patten commission under the chairmanship of the EU Commissioner, Chris Patten, was to engage in the aggiornamento of the former RUC, which we all agree was in urgent need of a major root and branch overhaul and a decided change of direction. The Patten commission set about this task with a will and recommended sweeping changes to the former RUC, not least of which was a change of name, insignia and the revolutionary measure of cross-secondment between the two police services.In order to make the new PSNI more representative of the two communities in Northern Ireland, recruitment was weighted on a 50:50 basis and initial responses have been disappointing with the lack of Nationalist confidence evident. Accordingly, the cross-fertilisation of  both police services should mark a major step forward in increasing mutual respect for the Garda and the PSNI in the eyes of the publics they serve. However, the involvement in the Troubles of undercover agents such as Fulton, Nelson and the latterly unmasked "Stakeknife", will have to be seriously addressed before public confidence in the brave new world of policing on the island of Ireland can be solidified.The level of criminal activity which has spiralled in recent years, the importation of drugs and the requirements of the road traffic control are merely some of the various areas where police co-operation will come into its own with mutual benefits accruing to both sides. The recently introduced penalty points legislation is a case in point where similar criteria should apply in both jurisdictions and points should apply to offending drivers, North and South. This would result in a further reduction in the number of road traffic fatalities.Recent events such as joint attendance of the PSNI Chief Constable and the Garda Commissioner at respective passing out parades and the football challenges between the two police teams are further evidence of the mutual respect and friendship which already exists between them. In the past, officers serving in a variety of British constabularies were appointed to senior positions in the former RUC. Among them is the current Chief Constable, Hugh Orde. The joint opening of senior positions to gardaí and PSNI officers with equivalence of recognition of training courses will mark a further step on the road to cohesion of policing on the island.Policemen and women from both services who participate in this secondment will be the principal purveyors of mutual understanding in the communities and largely instrumental in helping to build bridges between North and South and within the respective communities. I am aware that members of the Garda Síochána and the PSNI have served with distinction in policing missions in Bosnia Herzegovina and Croatia as part of the OSCE operation in the Balkans.Both police services have gained invaluable experience while training in US police departments in a number of cities. PSNI officers and gardaí have participated in joint training courses in the respective training colleges. It will be possible for young people to identify with gardaí on secondment in the North, thus enhancing respect for what may previously have been perceived as an alien police force.I welcome the Bill as sending out positive signals to both communities in the North and both parts of the island. Positive results will flow from this level of co-operation to both parts of the island with the growth of mutual respect and confidence for both police services among the public.

We often speak of historic days. This is a unique day. I am glad to be able to contribute to the debate on the Bill and see the various issues addressed under the Good Friday Agreement, including policing, and the aims everyone had at the time being implemented. It is important that there will be a formalised link in this legislation between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI. I hope the Bill will result in improved crime prevention and detection and more effective apprehension of offenders in both jurisdictions.The Patten report made 175 recommendations, nine of which specifically related to co-operation with the Garda Síochána. It is important the Government shows where it wants to go. We could wait forever for situations to be ideal. The question is when will they become ideal. Should we go ahead instead and take the lead? It is important we welcome the Bill because it will bring a balance into the community and senior ranks in the police service.Given that the enactment of the legislation is a key measure in implementing the policing principles within the Good Friday Agreement and the Patten report, I want to see it improving the level of cross-community confidence, especially confidence in the impartiality of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. There is no doubt that this will be difficult to achieve. There is a great deal of history. Members have already alluded to Brian Nelson, Stakeknife and others. A great deal of history must be overcome but unless we make a start, when will we ever reach the position to which we aspire? In this regard, this day is historic.We must take on board that this legislation will lead to gardaí at some ranks working on an all-Ireland basis and facilitate the PSNI in working alongside the Garda. If someone had said to me when I first went to college in Belfast in 1986 that we would have a peace process, a new police service, significantly fewer killings and maimings, much more practical co-operation between local authorities on both sides of the Border and similar levels of co-operation between community groups, I would not have believed him or her, yet it has happened. There are practical examples in many parts of the province in which I live. For example, the car ferry crossing the Foyle linking counties Antrim and Donegal carried 198,000 passengers in the first six months. This may possibly offend many in Derry city because Donegal folk now go directly to County Antrim rather than through Derry. It is probably doing the same the other way around.In terms of community groups, Farcet links people from the Shankill Road with those in Inishowen. When I met them in Belfast recently, they asked me would I have ever believed that I would be in a position to see the two groups  working hand in hand so well with common goals. Every time they seek assistance from funding agencies or others, they are asked what the Shankill Road and Inishowen have in common. On face value, perhaps it is not a lot but if one examines and works at it, it will be seen that they have much in common and in need of resolution. That is the case for all communities.This is not to say life in Ulster is rosy. It has a long way to go but has also come a long way. It is important to use every opportunity to commend the successes as well as be aware of what yet remains to be achieved. I remember the small things, the inconveniences, such as being stopped at the door of the larger shops and shopping centres waiting to be searched before going in; sitting in a queue at one of the many Border checkpoints on a Sunday night hoping the delay would not leave me late for the bus back to college in Belfast; having the bus return to its base after bricks came through the windows on certain nights, especially after marches, and wondering when or if we might reach our destination safely; walking around Derry and being very aware of, but taking as normal, the huge army presence amid the community which was about its regular business; and walking through Belfast to get the bus or train to Derry to hear, on arrival in Derry, that some of the very buildings I had passed by were blown up and I had just missed being caught up in the incident by minutes.I remember the stories of how my late grandfather's pub was blown up in the early 1970s and knowing the devastating blow that that was for him and his family. I remember the time he and my grandmother, when they were in their late 70s-early 80s, were held at gunpoint in their home and their car – my grandfather's pride and joy – was taken and the trauma that was for them.These are incidental points and not huge compared with the inconvenience, discommoding, terror and the many other words one can use to relate the horror people endured over the past 30 years on many different fronts, so much of which has become history. It is with great clarity I recall the first time I drove through the Culmore checkpoint and realised there were no soldiers present, although they had been that morning. With great clarity I recall my sense of concern and pure fear as I finally drove on without having been given the formal approval I was so conditioned to receiving. With a sense of optimism I have often thought of the number of children at primary school and going into secondary school in places such as the Creggan, where I taught, who never saw those days and I trust will never see them in the future.It is time to put the past behind us and move on, something I know is easier to say than do. A great deal of history is involved. Some might say it is recent history. If that is the case, it needs to be dealt with. It is important to me that the Bor der continues to blur and that locations such as the north-west proceed and progress in the only way they can, namely, in unity and harmony.We have faced the same difficulties to different degrees through our geographical location – from the traditional east--west bias that occurs on the island of Ireland through to the external perception of the "danger" of coming into the north-west with either a tourist or business venture. We have much shared history to overcome and many infrastructural deficiencies to remedy and the solutions lie in our working together. Inishowen has recently been traumatised by the decline of the textile industry which has also happened in Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh. The loss of Desmonds in the recent past has shown that we have the same difficulties in maintaining and gaining any sort of employment opportunities other than in the textile industry.This Bill expands the formal links between the new PSNI and the Garda Síochána to yield real co-operation on the ground. The old gut reaction and old memories of what the RUC name provoked from very many Nationalists and republicans will take time to overcome but it is up to us all to ensure that the PSNI evolves into an organisation of all the people for all the people. It is vital that everyone respects and trusts their police force. This can only be achieved by the participation of all sections of the people to ensure that true community policing can be achieved. Confidence building will take time but I am sure that for some, the Garda moving into all parts of the island will also cause unease for some elements.I am speaking in the debate on this Bill because I am a public representative for Donegal North-East and the issue of cross-Border crime remains high on the agenda particularly for Border towns and villages. I want to see a blurring of the Border as crime does not recognise borders and I believe criminals should not be harboured or facilitated by partitionist mentalities.Donegal has had many murders and experienced crimes such as minor robbery. I remember people such as Breege Porter and Oliver Boyce who were murdered in Birdstown, Burnfoot, County Donegal on 1 January 1973. A number of years later, councillor Eddie Fullerton was murdered in Buncrana. Many minor robberies have been committed over the years and there have often been proven or unproven connections of a cross-Border nature. Some work has been happening in respect of co-operation and sharing of information and this has yielded, in some cases, results in the form of returned goods and-or convictions. In other cases, the Border has proven a safety net for some offenders and therefore the expansion of co-operative measures, in my opinion, has a huge potential for good in my constituency.Types of crime and types of criminals do not vary much internationally. There are many com mon threads and much shared psychology. The Garda Síochána has its own experience and specialist knowledge as mentioned by other speakers and I note the criminal assets legislation and the effect that has had on tackling the "big guy", for want of a better expression. I think of how much of the extortion rackets in the Six Counties could be tackled should the experience of the Garda and the legislation of the Republic expand into or be enacted there. Similarly, the Police Service in Northern Ireland will have its own expertise and special focus from which we too can learn. Last weekend I travelled from Coleraine to Belfast and passed seven separate patrols checking for speeding over this relatively short distance. This is not something seen in Donegal or on any other stretch of road that I have travelled for quite some time.

There were at least three patrol cars and three separate motorcycle patrols. Whatever about the three cameras we have, they were putting the resources where they thought problems could arise. The cross-fertilisation of ideas and approaches to crime can yield a better standard of living for all communities on our island.There are resource implications attached to any Bill. We all have our own issues about Garda numbers in any given location. My sister's car was stolen in Belfast recently. The police there told her that they, too, were under pressure through lack of manpower. We seem to have common problems in that regard. I have difficulties in relation to the Garda numbers and Garda visibility in lnishowen that I have documented in many fora over the years. In 1980, the Garda strength in the Buncrana district was 103; now in 2003 we have 77 gardaí with a number of others due to return.I received a letter recently from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding my belief that the Border Garda stations are disappearing in terms of numbers of personnel. While this letter states that gardaí are not disappearing from rural stations in Inishowen, I take issue with that. The reason given for the drop in numbers is that of the changed needs of the Border. The threat to the Border regions may have changed post the Good Friday Agreement but Border crime, in my opinion, has not decreased and could be said to have increased given that the there is an economic boom in my area, particularly because of the difference in petrol and diesel prices. The dormant villages are now on  the other side of the Border and we have gained from the changes.While I welcome an initiative set up by the Garda in Donegal to have a special unit to assist in fighting the particular problems facing Border businesses in places such as Muff, Bridgend and Lifford due to the petrol and diesel price differential, I worry about the strength of the force in the Buncrana district.Muff is a very busy Border village whose population has increased by some 200% in just a couple of years and has a very high turnover in the mainly fuel-generated businesses located there. Figures supplied by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform state that this village is served by just one Garda sergeant and two gardaí. Given that there are four shifts in a day, we can imagine what stress that puts on these members of the force. Their plight is undermined further by the lack of a Garda station. It took the Office of Public Works two years to complete the purchase of a house and it looks like it could be months more before it becomes a station. The speed of progress is simply unacceptable and unfair. As this village is a focal access to and from Derry, cross-Border activity – of which there is plenty – leaves this community vulnerable and the Garda have relied on co-operation with the police in Derry to apprehend perpetrators and recover goods.In the past two weeks, a Garda car was rammed in a chase in Bridgend caused by cross-Border crime. This village is served by the station in Burnfoot. Despite the burglaries and the ongoing incursions, to borrow a phrase, we are threatened with closure of the station at night. This would be more acceptable if we could see people on the ground at night. We have eight stations in Inishowen and six of those are no longer open at night. I remind the Minister that I was told officially in October 2002 that there is only one vehicle, sometimes two, on patrol in Inishowen. There are officially eight members of the Garda on duty on Sundays in the peninsula, despite it being a social focal point for many people in Derry and even County Antrim. It is a bit like saying that there are only three speed cameras in the whole country, even saying that can cause more problems than it solves because people do not believe they will be caught and they take the gamble.

Without co-operation from across the Border in the recent past, we would be in an even more serious situation than that in which we  currently find ourselves. Co-operation has been a vital support, regardless of whether people realise it. I ask the Minister to assist me in setting up some forum with the commissioner so that I can relay to him the facts and statistics coming from both the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his office. I am not particularly proud of these statistics.I come from an area which includes Buncrana. People spoke about the atrocities which have not been resolved. I knew Rosemary Nelson very well and I am familiar with the families of some of the children blown up in the Omagh bomb. It is important that co-operation at every level continues in order to ensure that those responsible for the older atrocities, including the Omagh bombing, are brought to justice.On a lighter note, someone mentioned the unification of the penalty points system, a development it would be possible to achieve. There has been a great deal of co-operation in the north-west on many cross-Border issues. I wish the Executive was in place and that the elections had proceeded. The fact that they did not go ahead is a great drawback for me in Donegal. While we are debating legislation to increase co-operation, I reiterate that we cannot move in respect of legislation on the Foyle because the Executive is not in place. We must bypass the Executive and get the British Government to update the legislation on the Foyle. There are problems in regard to roads, rail, gas, broadband and electricity – including the issue of a wind farm. All these matters could be advanced significantly if the Executive was in place. As stated previously, we have worked with Ministers of every political shade to try to advance cross-Border co-operation. Local interaction achieves results and, therefore, I would like to see the Executive in place as soon as possible. It is important to advance the issues to which I have referred.Moving personnel from one police service to another so that people can work in co-operation is very important and the resources for this must be put in place. It will not undermine the co-operation which is currently taking place. A lot of good work is being done by the Garda and at cross-Border level in my area. I would like this to operate as positively as possible. I agree with screening people engaged in either police force to try to establish their background.

As previous speakers said, Garret FitzGerald was vilified for this principle in the 1970s just as Collins was vilified for his principles in the 1920s. When ideas are first mooted, they take a considerable period to perco late down to communities and, in particular, to some political parties.Everyone can have confidence in the Bill. It is about having confidence, North and South, in the system of justice that obtains and in the police forces that will uphold the laws in both jurisdictions. It is not just the issue of a united Ireland, but one of a unity of purpose between North and South, even though it is a unity we in the South would ultimately like to see. It will be an historic and important day, the arrival of which we must encourage, when both communities in the North have confidence in the police force. The Bill will help us flesh out some thoughts on the issues concerned.The recent question of "Stakeknife" has created much comment and concern in my constituency in County Louth. It reflects memories of when people in County Louth were tortured and savagely murdered by paramilitary organisations. People expressed to me this week their deep concerns about these events which happened not so long ago. One point which has been made very strongly is that all this must end. The fact that the IRA has been on ceasefire for five years and that Sinn Féin in the South and North has made political gains is welcome. However, one further step must be made. It has been brought to mind again this week that there must be an end to all paramilitary activities, including gun-running and targeting people, North and South. I want to stress that if and when that happens, we will have a true unity of purpose, North and South, in terms of working peacefully for our different political aims.I congratulate Deputy Crawford on his contribution, which was particularly impressive. He spoke about his grandfather and I can talk about my granduncle, who fought with the IRA and then joined the Irish Army. My wife's grandfather was a member of the RIC and later became a member of the Garda Síochána. We can recall the commitment all our families and the different generations have given to their politics and views.The Bill will ensure that our grandchildren will be able to say that this generation shaped their future, the peace in their country and brought about a unity of purpose – including a unified police force with independent control, North and South. The country is changing radically. As Deputy Deasy said to me earlier, we have come an awful long way in the past 20 years. This is one of the most important points in our history. We must encourage everyone to extend the hand of peace, North and South.Like Deputy Keaveney, I can speak about my experiences coming from a Border county. When my children were young I would drive across the Border into Newry and they would ask, "Daddy, is this soldier town?" or say "We will go up to soldier town", because there were soldiers everywhere. I recall one occasion which was quite  frightening at the time but which, looking back, was actually quite funny. I was travelling across the Border with the late councillor, Micheál O'Donnell, to attend a conference in Donegal. British Army soldiers jumped out of the ditch, pointed their guns at us and asked for our names. I told them my name was Fergus O'Dowd. They then turned to Micheál and asked, "What is your name?". "Micheál O'Donnell is ainm dom", a dúirt sé. I said, "God we'll be shot, you're an awful man, Micheál". The soldier asked us where were we going and I gave him the directions. Micheál gave out to me and asked why I provided the information. I was damn glad to get out of the place. I drove Micheál O'Donnell to Donegal but I did not bring him home again – I left that pleasure to someone else. I thank God that those days are over and that things are progressing so much.I want to reflect also on gardaí in Border areas. There was a very large Garda presence in Dromad, County Louth. While it had to be there, I am glad it will be significantly reduced and that gardaí will be redeployed from the Border, where they did a fantastic job, to work in our towns and cities where they are so badly needed.I also remember the members of the Garda who sacrificed their lives during the struggle. In particular, I remember Garda Sergeant Morrissey, from Drogheda, who was murdered in County Louth. It was a tragedy for his family and the community. There is an international association of policemen in Dundalk and I discussed this with its members. I can only speak from my knowledge of the South but mention must be made of the tremendous work, commitment, dedication and patriotism of gardaí during the years, particularly the Troubles. Few people, when they leave home each day for work, think they might never return. It happened to Garda Gerry McCabe and Garda Clerkin. I also remember when Garda Fallon was murdered in the 1970s during the bank raid on the quays. I remember the spot, although it does not appear to be marked by a plaque. I have often looked but as there is a railing, I cannot see it clearly. The Garda has done a fantastic job.I was most impressed by the Stevens inquiry. Everything is not perfect and the report contains many unanswered questions but I was particularly impressed by Sir John Stevens when he addressed the press conference. The new chief constable in the North is also impressive. Things have changed radically and well. Tony Blair made a significant contribution to the peace process. I cannot relate him in history to any previous Prime Minister. When one reads the history books, Mr. Gladstone comes across well but Tony Blair will probably be a significant and powerful figure in Irish history. I have the greatest respect for him.On the political front, in the South there has been unity of purpose on this issue. When we say we praise the Government, we are mirroring the views of the people. All parties in the House have been together on this. It is not a politically divisive issue but one where we are acting with the force of history and the unity of our people to bring about these changes. I welcome the Bill and this debate.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	605	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It is historic legislation which traces its roots to Garret FitzGerald who, a number of years ago, suggested that there should be closer co-operation between the two police forces, North and South. It is great to see it come about eventually.It was poignant of Deputy O'Dowd to mention the death of gardaí who were protecting the State and its institutions. They lost their lives serving the State. We should accord them recognition in the context of the debate on this legislation. I hope we will not return to past experiences or see again the huge and tragic loss of life experienced, North and South. County Roscommon experienced a number of incidents and a number of Garda personnel from the county lost their lives. A neighbour, Garda Hand, comes to mind in that regard.This legislation deals with police co-operation, North and South. It is about unity of purpose between the two jurisdictions. One of the key aims of the Bill is to increase cross-Border co-operation for dealing with crime and enforcing legislation across the Border. However, it does not go far enough in that regard.A number of speakers mentioned road safety, on which there could be close co-operation between the authorities, North and South. Currently, the penalty points system in the South cannot be applied to the licences of drivers from Northern Ireland or any other jurisdiction. There should be mutual recognition, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, of the system and the benefits that can come from it with regard to road safety. This will require an agreement between the Republic and either the authorities in Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom on the creation of a comparable list of offences and attaching penalty points to them which apply on either side of the Border and can be totalled together. The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body has produced a report on this. It suggests that a person who collects 12 penalty points, regardless of which side of the Border they collected them, be put off the road. We need to be conscious of cross-border co-operation not only with regard to the Border between the North and South but also with continental Europe in the context of the application of the penalty points system.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in Brussels on 8 May to agree the principles for the mutual recognition of financial penalties. In a statement following that Council meeting the Minister said that if somebody received a fine for a road traffic offence in the Republic, they could be pursued in the North. However, we really need to see this happen in relation to penalty points also. There is a correlation between the road accident statistics and the fact that Northern drivers coming south of the Border cannot be apprehended. I was speaking last evening with a former Member of the House, Brendan McGahon, who lives north of Dundalk on the Dundalk-Newry road. He has told me he has never seen a speed trap on that section of the road. The reason is that it is pointless for gardaí to do so because the people they catch are from Northern Ireland and cannot be pursued. This is something that must be examined.There are also continental European drivers on our roads who sometimes drive on the wrong side of the road and become involved in road traffic accidents. In fact, 15% of all accidents happen on the wrong side of the road. In other words, one car is on the wrong side of the road. Nearly 12% of all accidents involve a foreign driver. The figures in relation to the North and the United Kingdom show that 3.6% of fatal and injury accidents involve either Northern Ireland or UK drivers in cars. However, this increases to 5.7% in the case of heavy goods vehicles. The big statistic relates to heavy goods vehicles coming from Northern Ireland. A total of 4.5% of all fatal and injury accidents on Irish roads involve a Northern driver of a heavy goods vehicle. This will bring to mind the accident in September 1998 when two children and three adults were killed in a head on collision in County Wicklow when a lorry ploughed into their minibus. In that case the driver was prosecuted.There is a mindset among Northern drivers that once they cross the Border, they are free. I was talking to a friend recently who lives in Belfast and often travels to Dublin. He has told me that until he reaches the Border and sees the sign welcoming people to County Louth, he watches the speedometer because he can have penalty points attached to his licence. As soon as he reaches that sign, however, "I put the boot to the floor from there to Dublin."  That is the attitude of all Northern drivers when they travel south of the Border. The statistics show that 4.5% of all accidents which result in somebody being hospitalised involve a heavy goods vehicle from the North of Ireland.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	606	I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House but I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, has not taken the time to come in to address this Adjournment issue.I am raising the case of the Beneavin De La Salle College in Finglas. It is a scandal that in 2003, school pupils and staff are expected to function in a school that is totally inadequate, overcrowded and unsafe. Beneavin De La Salle College is a 40 year old building that was not of particularly good quality when it was originally built. The problem is that it has been left in its original state with little or no refurbishment since then. It is overcrowded and needs to be extended and totally upgraded.It is wrong to expect pupils to operate in a building like this. These pupils come from low and middle income families – they are not well off by any means – and many of those families would be struggling to keep their sons in school. In these circumstances, and in all circumstances related to young people, we should show them respect and try to encourage them to respect education. That is difficult if the State is not prepared to provide adequate school buildings and expects young people to operate in dilapidated, outdated conditions that would be more appropriate to the 1950s.It is also wrong to expect staff to work in such conditions. No other group of workers would put up with the substandard conditions staff in Beneavin and many other schools are expected to tolerate. All of the school's roofs are leaking and the windows are draughty and need to be replaced urgently. The heating system is completely inadequate – the boiler is 40 years old. When the school was extended in 1981, the same boiler was used and it cannot provide adequate heat to meet even the minimum standards set down for schools.The toilets are a disgrace, again like something from the 1950s. We should not expect people to put up with such conditions. The science rooms are the original rooms from 40 years ago, completely dilapidated with the original furniture still in place. One of the science rooms was seriously damaged in a fire in 1998. One of the walls was badly burnt and it has not been replaced or repaired because the school was told to wait for the full refurbishment job. The school now, therefore, has a science room with a fire damaged wall, ancient furniture and equipment. This is at a time when we are trying to encourage young people to take an interest in the sciences but it is clear to them that the Government is not interested in  teaching the sciences in a modern environment. Mixed messages are being sent.The computer room is in a converted toilet, the technology room in a converted football changing room and the library in a converted cloakroom. All of those conversions were carried out over the years by the teaching staff in their own time at the weekends or during holidays with no assistance whatsoever from the Department of Education and Science.The construction studies room is a health and safety nightmare. I was in it myself recently and it is a tiny room that cannot accommodate the class, never mind the materials and equipment. There is no proper storage and it is seriously overcrowded and undoubtedly unsafe. The geography room is also unsafe. It is inaccessible to students with disabilities as there is no lift in the school and it is upstairs. There is no art room, music room or facilities for drama. In spite of that, the school stages an annual show with the latest taking place in a local football club during the past week.Incredibly, in spite of the appalling conditions that everyone in the school endures, student numbers are rising, with an enrolment of almost 400 at present and a steadily rising trend in the past five years. That is a credit to the staff and the quality of teaching provided.Umpteen meetings have been held between the board of management and officials in the Department, including two that took place in Tullamore to which people had to travel. Negotiations have been ongoing since 1999. In December 2002, planning permission was obtained for phase one, half of the work. The Department has now told the school to seek planning permission for the second half of that work. I am seeking an assurance from the Minister that this is not another delaying tactic. I ask the Minister not to trot out the usual statistics and tell us what he will do in the coming years, but to tell us what he intends to do for the students and staff in Beneavin De La Salle College in Finglas because they urgently need the modern conditions conducive to learning that they deserve to be put in place. The Minster of State's colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, will testify that current conditions are completely inadequate and unfair.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to discuss the position regarding the upgrading of school accommodation at Beneavin De La Salle College.To date, the Department of Education and Science has invested heavily in Beneavin de la Salle College. In 1999 the school hall, which was originally built in 1961 as a concert hall, was subject to an arson attack. The hall was badly damaged  and, as a result of the fire, had to be completely demolished. A design team was appointed to rebuild the hall. Although funding was obtained from the school's insurers, the bulk of the funding came from the Department. The school was granted a new sports hall in the area of 608 square meters plus ancillary, giving a total approved area of 806 square metres at a cost of €1,574,152. The Department of Education and Science provided funding in the amount of €915,667. Additionally all the design team fees for the project were paid. Funding was also provided in the amount of €24,125 for the provision of screening to the balcony area.An examination of the school's accommodation at the time of the commencement of the PE hall project noted that the school was in need of refurbishment. Consistent with standard practice in the Department's building unit, a schedule of overall accommodation was prepared, based on a long-term projected enrolment of 450 pupils, comprising a total area of 3,990 square metres. This was duly agreed with the school's board of management. The design team that was appointed for the PE hall project was retained for the proposed refurbishment-extension project. A number of options for the refurbishment-extension at the school were advanced – refurbishment of the entire school and an extension with the demolition of the administration building, part new build, part refurbishment or a new school building.A meeting was held in the Tullamore office of the Department of Education and Science in December 2000 with officials from the building unit, the school management authority and its design team to discuss the possible options. It was agreed by all parties at this meeting that option two – part new build, part refurbishment – was the most feasible because it represented the best value for money. The school management authority welcomed this choice since it meant that some of the original buildings would remain as a link with the past history of the school. The design team was advised to progress the project to stage two – outline sketch scheme – based on option two.When stage two was submitted to the Department in August 2000, it was noted that projected costs for the project exceeded the European Union thresholds for the appointment of a design team. To comply with procurement procedures in the matter of the design team appointments, it has been necessary to split this project into two separate phases.The phase one works consist of demolition of the science block and canteen block, construction of a new two storey classroom extension to the existing main classroom block to the front of the school and associated landscaping, car parking and ancillary works. All remaining works will be addressed as part of phase two.Phase one has progressed through architectural planning and the design team is currently in the process of preparing stages four and five – detail design-bill of quantities – of architectural planning. The project is included in section six of the 2003 schools building programme, which includes large-scale building projects that are at an advanced stage of architectural planning, the pre-tender stage. The timing of when the phase one works at Beneavin de la Salle College can progress to tender and construction is dependent on the funding in 2004 and subsequent years.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	608	I wish to raise the issue of the stay in school retention initiative in Coláiste Mhuire, Johnstown, County Kilkenny, which is to have its funding cut before the completion of the programme. The programme commenced in 2000 with funding of €50,800 per annum and the school completion programme was introduced in 2002 for the 53 schools not included in the programme. The SSRI funding is to be phased out over three years with full funding this year, half funding next year and a quarter funding in 2004-05. This funding is critical to the development of many of the services and initiatives that help to retain pupils in the school. Since its inception the scheme has been beneficial in several ways. It has succeeded in retaining disadvantaged students over the past two years and has enabled the staff to provide smaller classes, homework clubs, meals, extra curricular activities such as music, dance, summer camps for incoming first years, revision courses at Easter and so on.The staff inform me that they were beginning to make inroads into the poor attendance record for some students at junior cycle but continue to have serious problems at senior cycle. The number of students doing the leaving certificate is approximately 50% of the first year intake. Only 6% of the children's parents sat the leaving certificate and the SSRI was helping to break the cycle of poverty. The region is classified as disadvantaged in north-west Kilkenny in several respects – agriculturally, economically and socially.Scrutiny of the school records reveals that early school leaving had been a tradition in the local community which the SSRI was addressing. Many parents have expressed a desire to see the homework clubs continue. They realise how beneficial they have been to their sons and daughters. Many of these parents did not complete second level education and now realise the mistake they made and do not want this to happen to another generation. Johnstown community college serves a wide geographical area. Its feeder school is Urlingford national school.Urlingford has category 5 status in health board terms in that it has the highest number of  medical card holders per head of population of any town in County Kilkenny. The entire allocation of SSRI money was used for the benefit of the students only in the Johnstown area. The programme addresses disadvantage and social exclusion – we hear a lot from this Government about what it is doing for social exclusion. It assists in the process of community development through the involvement of students and their parents in developing and devising the SSRI plan. The plan has helped the community development group in Urlingford, one of the feeder school areas, to develop a homework club for sixth class students in that school.There is disappointment at the announcement and the letter to the school authorities from the Department of Education and Science, that funding is being slashed for the next school year by 50%, in spite of the benefits I have outlined to the educational attainment of the students and to the presence of an initiative which helps them to stay in school. It is disappointing that the Department has seen fit to make this draconian cut in funding for a scheme that was successful and it demonstrates once again that cuts in public expenditure are hitting people in disadvantaged areas hardest. These are the people who can least afford to bear these cuts if they are to better themselves through educational attainment. If we have any social values they should enshrine equality of opportunity in education. The SSRI and the school completion programme are important schemes to ensure that children stay in school, that they better themselves through education and that they have the best chance of getting suitable employment at the end of that scheme. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that he makes the necessary recommendations and brings to the attention of the Minister of Education and Science the need to retain full funding for Coláiste Mhuire in Johnstown, in the interests of the pupils and their future careers.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding this matter.As he may be aware, the school completion programme has been implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of the Department of Education and Science's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The school completion programme is a new and significantly expanded programme to deal with early school leaving, building on the experience and best practice derived from two previous pilot early school leaving initiatives, the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative at second level.Early school leaving is a key indicator for subsequent difficulties including long-term unem ployment, poverty, homelessness, substance abuse and criminal activity. At present, our retention rate to completion of senior cycle remains at 81.6%. While the achievement of 90% retention rate has been a long-standing policy objective and is a headline target of the national anti-poverty strategy, it is important to stress that early school leaving is not a simple matter to resolve and that by their nature, preventative interventions require time to make an impact.The evidence from the two pilot initiatives demonstrated that the most effective way of addressing educational disadvantage is through an integrated, cross-community approach based on the development of local strategies aimed at maximising educational participation levels. The school completion programme is based on the recognition that a wide variety of home, community and school-based factors can contribute to low school attainment and early school leaving.The programme seeks to target individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, by arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. It necessitates the establishment of local management committees to oversee the projects at local level, comprising representatives from statutory, voluntary and community agencies, RAPID, CLÁR and city or county development boards, where appropriate, in partnership with schools. The local management group is, therefore, required to assess the needs of marginalised educationally disadvantaged young people at local level and to devise an integrated, costed, focused and targeted retention plan that will support these young people in their school, home and community life. Representatives of schools and agencies on the local management group must engage school staff and parents in a consultative and planning process in order that the retention plan supports the needs of all young people at risk.The programme focuses on the areas of greatest need. Sites for participation were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department of Education and Science's post-primary pupils database. This analysis also identified the main feeder primary schools. A total of 82 projects – 65 Clew project sites together with the existing 17 early school leaver initiative projects – were selected to participate in the school completion programme.In addition to the 82 school completion projects, the Department of Education and Science continues to support 53 second level schools which were funded previously under the SSRI but were not selected for the project phase of the school completion programme. At that time, it was decided to support these 53 schools, which include Coláiste Mhuire, Johnstown, County  Kilkenny, under an SSRI strand of the school completion programme on a phasing out basis to 31 August 2005. This involves providing 50% funding for the school year 2003-04 and 25% funding for 2004-05.However, the Department is currently reviewing the position regarding the SSRI strand. Any decision to include SSRI strand schools in the school completion programme will be based on a selection process which will take into account the latest available analysis of pupil retention rates at second level. The 53 SSRI schools will be notified of the outcome of this review shortly. I assure the Deputy that I will bring his views to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science. Deputy Kehoe and I have already had similar discussions in regard to Enniscorthy vocational school and are very much aware of the importance of continuing the programme.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I speak tonight in my capacity as tourism spokesperson and also as a bog standard Deputy from Dublin Mid-West constituency, which has fast-growing areas such as Lucan and Clondalkin and more rural areas such as Newcastle, Saggart, Rathcoole and Brittas. I constantly receive phone calls from people in all those places about rubbish, dumping, litter and all sorts of things. As tourism spokesperson it has been brought to my attention that guidebooks such as Lonely Planet describe Dublin as filthy.We all know about the dumping problems throughout the country and action needs to be taken to tackle them. I am not the environment spokesperson, but there is a solution to alleviate some of the problems with litter. I could not help but notice that quite a few people are observing this debate and, without meaning to insult anyone in the Visitors Gallery, I presume that most of them are over the age of 18 and will therefore remember when we had money-back bottles. I remember as a child that I collected them at every chance I got, because one used to get 5p on a bottle. It was a very good way for a young fellow to make a few pounds, but it was also a very good way of recycling.Sadly, money-back bottles were thrown out. It was considered progress to have one and a half or two litre plastic bottles, which bring with them a number of environmental problems. They are difficult to recycle, and the rings sometimes become caught up in the gullets of birds, fish and mammals. My main point is that there is no reason money-back bottles cannot be reintroduced. The same is true of the idea of money-back cans, which are in use throughout the European Union – in Sweden, Finland, Germany, Denmark and other countries.Denmark is a case in point. The Danish went one step further. Until 1996, the Danes would not even allow cans to be used in their country. They insisted that everything be reusable rather than recyclable. The European Commission, in its packaging directive of 1998, said that the Danes had to use cans. Now the Danes have a levy on cans, with a 10% to 48% deposit payable on recyclable items such as cans and bottles. The same is true of Sweden. I had the opportunity to visit Stockholm where one enters a supermarket with one's beer can or bottle and shoves it into a machine which prints out a receipt allowing the bearer to a certain amount off groceries.We have the reputation of being a clean, green country, but at the same time we are in danger of throwing out the baby with the bath water and discouraging repeat tourists at a time when the economy is going down the Swanee because of the dirty – increasingly, filthy – nature of our country as a tourist destination. It would make sense to do anything in our power that would not impose any cost on the Exchequer to ensure that we become a little cleaner.Every town has its drinkers, whether under age or not, going down to the fields with their cans. I will not get into a conversation about under age drinking tonight. However, if all the people of a certain age around the country had to pay an extra 20 to 50 cent on their cans, I guarantee they would not be leaving them at the bottom of a field or in the local park. They would collect them and even look for those of other people. The same is true of bottles. We might have the opportunity to make the recycling of bottles viable again in this country. The Greens maintain that the closure of the Irish Glass Bottle plant at Ringsend was a tragedy as now we must export the majority of our glass across the Border to Fermanagh.A market will exist as long as the Government commits some of its legislative power to making it work. To help the country to be a little cleaner regarding cans and bottles, I ask the Minister of State to pass on to the Minister, Deputy Cullen, the fact that there is support in schools throughout my constituency and elsewhere for recycling. Local councils sometimes charge for the privilege, but if the Minister were to introduce a charge for glass bottles and cans at whatever level he felt equitable, I guarantee that he would solve some of the dumping problems overnight and encourage recycling which I believe would double or treble. I ask the Minister to consider the suggestion, given that its administration would not incur significant cost for the Exchequer.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	611	As Deputy Gogarty says, his idea is not new. I am surprised that he can remember when one got one's money back. I thought that it was  reserved for such fellows as myself, who might have been around for a little longer. It was something of a bonanza at that time. I am not entirely sure that young children nowadays would be as dedicated to chasing a few bob as we might have been a few decades ago.The image of Ireland as a clean environment is important to us all, but particularly to those in the tourism sector. We all have a role to play, not only in maintaining that image, but also in actively promoting its profile both nationally and internationally. Article 15 of EU Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste permits EU member states to use economic instruments to facilitate the achievement of their targets thereunder regarding the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The use of economic instruments has now become more widespread in EU countries as a means of improving waste management practices.As the Deputy knows, my Department introduced an environmental levy on plastic bags on 4 March 2002, something that some other EU countries will by now regard with awe and threaten to imitate. The levy's primary purpose was to influence consumer behaviour directly with a view to minimising the use of plastic bags dispensed at retail outlets and lessening their impact on the environment as a highly visible component of litter. The imposition of the environmental levy on plastic bags has been an overwhelming success, with a reduction in excess of 90% in their use and a subsequent corresponding impact on the visible environment.An Agreed Programme for Government states that consideration will be given to the extension of the levy on plastic bags to other areas such as non-reusable packaging. I am actively considering the issues involved, but final decisions have not yet been taken on the items which should be targeted as a priority in that regard. A decision to introduce a levy or, as the Deputy suggests, deposit and refund scheme, on any material would require considerable analysis and evaluation and would need, inter alia, to take account of the life-cycle analysis of the material in question and effects on the operation of existing successful initiatives, such as Repak. I will, however, keep the use of glass bottles and cans under review and will consider whether further arrangements are required to improve their collection and recovery and minimise their use where possible.I also bring Members' attention to the new Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, which revise or replace previous regulations made in 1997 and subsequent amending regulations made in 1998. The new packaging regulations are intended to facilitate Ireland's achievement of the 50% packaging waste recovery target by the end of 2005, as set out in the EU directive on packaging and packaging waste.  The regulations came into effect on 1 March 2003 and introduced a requirement that all producers participating in bringing packaging on to the Irish market must segregate packaging waste arising on their own premises into specified waste streams, such as waste glass, paper, aluminium, steel, fibreboard, wood and plastic sheeting, and have it collected by authorised operators for recycling. That provides that such specified waste can no longer be landfilled and will have a significant impact on future expansion of our recycling efforts.I am sure Deputy Gogarty is already aware of most of this information, but I will pass on his comments to the Minister, Deputy Cullen, although I am not sure if he will take us right back to the days the Deputy spoke about.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue. I appreciate the attendance of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern.The disabled persons and essential repairs grants schemes administered by the housing authorities throughout the country are of crucial importance and have enabled the upgrading of many homes. The disabled persons grant scheme has made a major positive contribution to the quality of life enjoyed by many elderly and disabled persons. The grant has enabled many disabled persons to continue to enjoy the comfort of their own homes with dignity, self-respect and the maximum attainable independence and it has saved the State huge expenditure that it would otherwise have incurred in providing hostel and residential places.A factor in the increasing demand for disabled persons grants has been the success of medical advances in extending the lifetime of persons who have some form of disability and, indeed, in the advances in areas such as rehabilitation of accident victims. These people can now return to the community rather than, as in the past, remaining in hospital.Applications for essential repairs grants have again risen by enormous leaps over the past three to four years in particular. In some cases, the number of applications received in 2002 has been over six times the number received in 1999. As with the disabled persons grant scheme, with the circumstances of today and people living longer and more people able to live in their own homes, the demand for the essential repairs grant scheme  has increased enormously. The investment made by the State in this grant represents, in the vast majority of cases, money well spent as it has precluded the need for a significant higher expenditure under different headings that would otherwise have been required to meet the same need. In many counties such as Cavan, where 300 essential repairs grants are processed and paid in any given year, this prevents significant numbers being added to the housing waiting lists and has solved the basic problem at a fraction of the cost.A few weeks ago I discussed with officials in Cavan County Council and with the county manager, Mr. Brian Johnston, the difficulties facing local authorities in funding these worthwhile schemes and the possibilities for improving them. It is sad that, in the meantime, Mr. Johnston, who was an outstanding county manager and an exceptional public servant, died suddenly. He was passionately committed to the need to provide proper housing accommodation for all our people with a particular emphasis on the needs of the disabled and the elderly.In County Cavan, there were 96 applications under the disabled persons grant scheme in 1997. By 2002 the number had risen to 316. In 1999 there were 99 applications for the essential repairs grant scheme and by 2002 there were 648. The grants paid out in 1997 in County Cavan under the disabled persons grant scheme amounted to €349,869 and in 2002 the figure had risen to €1,615,846. In 1997 no essential repairs grants were paid out in County Cavan and in 2002 the expenditure under that heading was €1,507,862.Between 1997 and 2002 the total expenditure paid out by Cavan County Council under both schemes amounted to €6,658,463. While significant expenditure has been incurred in County Cavan during the years in question, it should be noted that this has ensured the adaptation and the improvement of over 1,023 homes at an average cost of €7,400 per home.I am also aware that in the period January 2003 to the end of April 2003 almost €1 million has been paid out under both headings with disabled persons grants and essential repairs grants commitments standing at over €4 million. This is a significant expenditure and it is particularly onerous on a local authority such as Cavan to ensure the means to provide the necessary local contribution. The local contributions arising from a commitment of €4 million, and the €1 million already invested, would be of the order of €1.4 million, not to mention the value of grant applications on hand which have not yet been processed.In order to continue the good work carried out under these schemes, it is necessary to refocus on the criteria which govern the processing and payment of the grants. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider amendments to the 2001 regu lations – S.I. 607 – at an early date in order to manage successfully these grant schemes on an ongoing basis. These amendments could include, at national level: a provision for applicants to provide a local contribution from within their own resources; a provision for a structured method of means testing of applicants similar to any tests applicable in the case of other State funding systems; and a mechanism that would enable local authorities to make, on a county by county basis, provision for hardship cases to be measured against a locally devised and adopted scheme. I am of the view that these changes would have the desired effect of controlling and preventing any unwarranted grants being paid under the essential repairs grant heading.I am not suggesting that persons who have a genuine disability that qualifies under the provisions of the scheme and who do not have the means to accommodate their own needs would be precluded from benefiting from the appropriate element of State funding. I am pleased the Minister of State who is extremely knowledgeable on all housing issues and has progressive ideas has initiated a review of these schemes. I hope the issues I have raised can be considered by him and his Department.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I thank Deputy Brendan Smith for his comments and for giving me the opportunity to speak about the review of the disabled persons grants scheme. The operation of the scheme is currently under review in my Department. On completion of the review, which I envisage will be finalised within a few months, I will be in a position to determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme. The essential repairs grants scheme will also be examined, as the regulations concerned cover both schemes.Officials from my Department met representatives from the Irish Wheelchair Association on 28 April 2003 and discussed their concerns in respect of the disabled persons grant scheme. The views and comments of the local authorities and other relevant voluntary agencies will be taken into account in the course of the review. I encourage Deputy Brendan Smith to tell his local councillors and the local council that if they have deeply considered this matter and they have a submission, they should forward it now to enable those comments and views to be considered in the review.The administration of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes is a matter for the individual local authorities. The framework for the operation of the scheme is laid down in the statutory regulations and, as far as is practicable, is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities. It is a matter for the authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the schemes in their areas from within the combined allocations notified to them  for this purpose by my Department. Notification of capital allocations to local authorities in respect of the payment of disabled persons and essential repairs grants for 2003 will issue shortly.My Department also recoups to local authorities two thirds of expenditure on the payment of individual grants. It is the responsibility of the authorities to fund the one third from their own resources, from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.There is no doubt that the significant improvements made in recent years to the disabled persons grant and the level of recoupment available have resulted in a substantial increase in the level of demand for assistance under the scheme. Deputy Brendan Smith gave some of the figures from his county's perspective. The effective maximum grant has doubled to more than €20,000 and recoupment is now two thirds, as against 50% six years ago.Expenditure on the scheme increased nationwide from €13 million for 2,455 grants in 1998 to €52.6 million for 5,932 grants last year. In line with this very significant increase in the Department's capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs also increased from €6.3 million in 1998 to almost €31.5 million last year. That is a fivefold increase in recoupment, which is considerable.The position is the same with regard to the essential repairs grant scheme. Significant improvements have led to increased levels of demand for assistance. Expenditure on the scheme increased from €2.2 million for 957 grants in 1998 to €16 million for more than 3,000 grants last year. Recoupment costs have also increased from €764,000 in 1998 to almost €8.8 million last year. This is more than a tenfold increase in recoupment in four years.These are significant increases in the levels of funding for both schemes. They are a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the disabled person's and essential repairs grant schemes. The review is under way and we will examine the regulations to see if they need to be amended.Given the increased level of spending by the Department and that a number of local authorities are finding it difficult to make provision for their one third contribution, changes will have to be made. We cannot continue to meet the growth in the number of applications at the rate that has occurred in the past couple of years. Deputy Brendan Smith referred to some of the measures we are considering, including a possible means and medical test, the question of providing loans rather than grants and whether there should be a claw-back if the house is sold within a short period, as often happens.The allocations for next year indicate that some counties use the scheme far more than others.  That is good provided a county makes provision in its estimates for its one third contribution. In the case of the two counties which Deputy Brendan Smith represents, County Cavan uses the scheme far more than County Monaghan. I am aware that people in County Monaghan are fit and agile and will beat teams from County Cavan in football matches. Given the expenditure by the different counties, it is difficult to understand the  reason some use the scheme four or five times more often than others, although it is acceptable provided they make provision in their estimates for their one third contribution. I ask the Deputy and his councillors to submit any views they have on the matter to the Department as quickly as possible.The Dáil adjourned at 7.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 15 May 2003.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	616	The Air Corps operates a number of different helicopter types, which in turn operate in a wide variety of roles. The operational demands on these helicopters increase in intensity as the summer months approach with the attendant arrival of more favourable weather and longer hours of daylight.Accordingly, the Air Corps tends to arrange routine annual and programmable maintenance procedures in the winter months due to these months featuring poorer weather and longer hours of darkness. This plan can, and does, ensure that the maximum number of operational flying hours are available when most needed.Maintenance falls into three broad categories: scheduled, unscheduled and routine-daily. The broad annualised maintenance plan as outlined will see somewhat more helicopters on the ground during scheduled maintenance during the winter months. This number can then grow when unscheduled occurrences arise in the operational fleet. These events then cause the number of helicopters unserviceable on any particular day to grow. However, most of these issues are readily resolved, resulting in the helicopter being rapidly returned to service.I am advised that no helicopter is despatched on air operations without satisfying a rigorous routine-daily maintenance programme to ensure that it is airworthy.I am also advised that the General Officer commanding the Air Corps is satisfied that none of the helicopters in the current fleet suffers from what is described by the Deputy as a serious reliability problem.

To date 40 of these vehicles have been received and a further 25 are scheduled for delivery in 2004. The total cost of the programme is in the region of €84 million.In addition to this programme, the Defence Forces has a requirement for a smaller light armoured vehicle, designated as a light tactical vehicle which can be used to protect troops engaged in peace support operations in areas where the larger Mowag APC would be inappropriate. For instance, the movement of one to three personnel in high risk confined areas and general surveillance work are among the key roles of the vehicle.Funding for this programme must be considered in the context of the larger APC programme and the changed financial situation and it has been agreed with the military authorities that the programme for the acquisition of the vehicles will not proceed for the present. In the meantime, the Defence Forces will continue to conduct further studies on the type and specification of vehicle required.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	619	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 89 to 91, inclusive, of 2 April last, when I reported on the discussions which had taken place at the informal meeting of Defence Ministers held in Athens on 14 March 2003. Since that date I have not had any further discussions with my EU colleagues.

There are, however, more than 50 married quarters presently being overheld by former members of the PDF or their families. The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married military personnel have an equal claim on such housing as other members of the community in the same income category.Meetings have been held between officials of the Department and the overholders as well as with officials of Kildare County Council.In cases where houses have been offered for sale to overholders, the Department has requested the co-operation of Kildare County Council in ensuring that mortgages are made available to eligible applicants and some progress has been made in this regard.My Department is continuing to examine all options, including affordable housing and voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, in the re-housing of those overholders who would in the normal way be eligible for local authority housing. Co-operative schemes are financed under the terms of the capital loan and subsidy scheme operated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities.The Department will be in further contact with the overholders in due course.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	621	There are no proposals to put in place an ongoing system of health monitoring for former members of the Defence Forces.Recently retired members of the Defence Forces, who had served either in the Balkans or in Kuwait, were offered health screening in 2001, specifically in relation to any anxieties they may have had in the light of the previous deployment and use of depleted uranium munitions during earlier conflicts in those particular areas of operation.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	622	On 15 January 2003 I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the Reserve, which had reported to me in September 1999.The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its country-wide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are currently being prepared within each brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of proposed newly amalgamated units but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to take part in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force.Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the Reserve, a better overall organisation structure, and opportunities for suitably qualified Reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the Reserve with the Army.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The Defence Forces do not posses armaments of the type referred to by the Deputy.It is an inevitable fact that in war, the use of all armaments by combating forces can result in horrendous consequences for both combatants and, unfortunately, for non-combatants. Recent images and reports from the war in Iraq have illustrated these consequences in very stark detail.During 2001, Deputies will recall that concerns were raised about Irish troops serving in Kosovo who might have been exposed to depleted uranium in their area or operations. At that time, a Defence Forces investigative team was sent to the Balkans and their findings confirmed normal levels of background radiation and, on the basis of the available evidence, that the threat to the health of Irish troops serving in the Balkans was negligible.A similar opinion on depleted uranium, published on 6 March 2001, by a group of experts established under Article 31 of the EURATOM Treaty also concluded, with some qualifications, based on realistic assumptions of the doses that might have been received that exposure could not produce any detectable health effects. This opinion provided further reassurance to troops who served in the Balkans during that time.The EU is engaged in developing capabilities for Petersberg Tasks, that is peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. Such peace support operations are, of their nature, grounded on the use, in the first instance, of consultation and mediation to achieve the operation's objectives. The use of military force is only considered when absolutely necessary and then usually only in self defence.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	624	The Government decided to replace the Gulfstream IV and the Beechcraft King Air in the ministerial air transport role. The decision was necessary to meet the ever increasing demands of Government business, not least in the context of a significantly enlarged European Union. The tender competitions for the acquisition of the aircraft are now in train. The closing date for the receipt of tenders for both competitions is 30 May 2003.The tender competitions allow for the submission of both new and pre-owned aircraft. All options such as outright purchase, lease, lease purchase, or other alternatives will be considered. The highly competitive nature of the aviation market at present should result in competitive packages being offered.In tandem with proposals for the supply of the aircraft, tenderers may also outline offers for the Gulfstream IV aircraft as at the proposed date of hand-over of the tendered aircraft or in mid-July 2004, following the EU Presidency. Offers for the Beechcraft King Air will also be considered in tandem with proposals for its replacement.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	625	A contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers APCs, initial spares, special tools and training courses. The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, included 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract spread over five years was in the region of €50.8 million, including VAT. The final stage payment of that contract was paid in January 2003. All 40 APCs have been delivered to the Curragh Camp.Training of Defence Force personnel on the APCs has been continuing apace and the first overseas deployment of the APCs has taken place with six APCs in service in Eritrea. I am advised by the military authorities that the APCs are performing exceptionally well in the mission area.The original contract contained an option for the supply of up to 40 additional APCs by Mowag. This option has now been exercised albeit for a reduced number of APCs because of the changed financial situation. I signed a contract on 9 December 2002 for the provision by Mowag of 25 additional APCs. The contract value is in the region of €33.2 million including VAT. Deliveries will commence in March 2004 and are scheduled to be completed by September 2004. Payments under the contract will extend from December 2002 to September 2005 due to the budgetary situation.The signing of the contract is another significant boost for the Defence Forces and a further indicator of my commitment to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are fully equipped with modern equipment which enhances their safety in carrying out their various roles.

The IED was disarmed by a Defence Forces explosives ordnance disposal (EOD) team. Sections of the IED were taken away for forensic examination by the Garda. The remainder was destroyed in situ by controlled explosion by the EOD team.I am advised by the military authorities that separate investigations into the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the IED are currently being conducted by the Military Police and the Garda.Security in all military posts is reviewed by the Defence Forces on an ongoing basis.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	627	On 9 April 2003 I launched the revised Defence Forces Administrative Instruction A7 Chapter 1 entitled, Interpersonal Relationships in the Defence Forces. A guidance booklet and easy reference card were also launched and are being provided for each member of the Defence Forces. The aim of this new administrative instruction is to set down policy and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces in order to deter unacceptable behaviour and promote a service environment based on mutual respect and professionalism.The instruction outlines Defence Forces policy in six areas of interpersonal relationships giving specific definitions, broadening definitions where necessary and giving examples of what is regarded as unacceptable behaviour.The instruction also provides detailed procedures for an individual who may wish to make a complaint of unacceptable behaviour. It explains how the individual can use either an informal or formal approach. It explains the methods by which a formal complaint can be dealt with using either the legal-disciplinary process, the existing military legal system, or the administrative action process for less serious complaints.An important feature to note is that the instructions protect the individual from intimidation or victimisation for making a complaint or assisting an investigation of a complaint. They also state that retaliation against a person for making a complaint or coming forward as a witness will be treated as a disciplinary offence. There is also provision for third parties to assist the individual in making a complaint.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	628	The position on this matter has not changed since I replied to this question six weeks ago. A total of 31 non-commissioned officers have been commissioned as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service in the past five years.Potential officers courses (POC) are held for non-commissioned personnel from time to time within the Defence Forces. Personnel who successfully complete such courses are commissioned as officers in the Permanent Defence Force. Participants on such courses are selected on a competitive basis. In addition, from time to time non-commissioned personnel who hold appropriate qualifications are commissioned to fill specialist appointments where vacancies arise. Eligible non-commissioned personnel may also apply for the annual cadetship competitions. The requirement for potential officer courses and commissioning from the ranks (CFR) competitions is reviewed from time to time and is being specifically addressed in the context of the integrated personnel management system (or IPMS) which is one of the major policy initiatives provided for in the White Paper on Defence. The IPMS will make specific and ongoing provision for the introduction of regular schemes to commission enlisted personnel as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. A proposed IPMS has been prepared by the military authorities and is now being considered by the Department's civil-military strategic management committee. I hope to see the IPMS finalised later this year.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	629	My position on this matter has not changed since I replied to this question six weeks ago. For the Deputy's benefit, I will repeat what I stated on 2 April last, namely that I believe to amend the Defence Act to allow the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to apply to members of the Defence Forces would be wholly inappropriate.I know that PDFORRA has placed a certain stress on the concept of the soldier as a "citizen in uniform" with the implication that the soldier's conditions of employment should largely replicate conditions in the civilian world. However, in a professional military organisation, this approach is simply not practical and this is widely recognised internationally. The position is that when an individual decides to join the Defence Forces, he or she voluntarily accepts, inter alia, a range of obligations and responsibilities which do not normally arise in the course of civilian employment. The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.I am satisfied the mechanisms available to the representative association through the Defence Forces' conciliation and arbitration scheme – with its access to facilitation and arbitration and parallel discussion during national pay talks – provide a framework within which issues of concern can, are and should continue to be addressed.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.The Deputy is aware that efforts were made in the recent past to acquire medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps with the holding of a tender competition. However, the tender competition was cancelled in July 2002 because of the budgetary constraints which meant that the level of Defence expenditure had to be reduced. Any decision to acquire medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps in the future can only be taken as the financial resources permit.The decision to cancel the tender competition was an extremely difficult one for me. I am also aware of the acute disappointment felt by Air Corps personnel when the decision was announced.However, having consulted the military authorities in the matter at that time the main priority outlined for the Air Corps was the purchase of fixed-wing training aircraft to ensure that cadets continued to be commissioned, trained as pilots and retained in the Air Corps. In that regard, I was delighted to sign a contract with Pilatus of Switzerland in January 2003 for the supply of eight turbo propeller training aircraft which will be delivered in 2004. The value of the contract, including VAT, is around €60 million. These aircraft are a very realistic response to the needs of the Air Corps at the current time.When the decision to cancel the tender competition was made, I asked my officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopters services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue (SAR), while taking account of the current financial position.An interdepartmental working group was established to seek alternate solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is also involved in assessing possible solutions. A report on this is currently being finalised.I am committed to maintaining the Air Corps role in the provision of SAR services and, in this regard, an S61 helicopter has been acquired for the Air Corps to operate in the North West region as a replacement for the Dauphin Helicopter. The S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coast Guard from CHCI pursuant to existing SAR contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coast Guard to the Air Corps. The Air Corps will provide the flight crews and the aircraft will be maintained by CHCI. The S61 will operate out of Sligo Airport where training is currently ongoing. It is expected that the helicopter will go operational for daylight hours in July 2003 with a full 24 hours service operational from October 2003.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	634	Drug abuse has long been recognised as a serious and escalating problem in our society. While there have been relatively few instances of drug related problems within the Defence Forces, it is recognised that the Defence Forces, as a component of the wider community, mirror the community at large. The implications of drug abuse in an organisation where personnel have access to firearms are too obvious to require elaboration.On 1 February 2002 a compulsory substance testing programme was introduced as part of a Defence Forces substance abuse programme. It followed a long consultative process involving the office of the Attorney General, the Deputy Judge Advocate General and the Defence Forces representative associations.Prior to the launch of the programme an education programme and awareness briefings were conducted throughout the Defence Forces. All personnel were issued with a booklet devised to inform them of the purpose of the new CRDT programme, the administrative procedures involved and the sanctions for those who test positive. All necessary measures, including pre-enlistment screening, education, compulsory random drug testing, monitoring and sanctions, will be taken to maintain a drug free environment within the Defence Forces.

Such meetings are normally held on one occasion during each EU Presidency, usually in advance of a meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in the format of Defence Ministers. It provides the EUMC at Chiefs of Defence staff level with an opportunity to discuss military aspects of the ESDP and to endorse reports being prepared by the EUMC for submission to the Political and Security Committee in advance of ministerial meetings. The Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Colm Mangan, attended the meeting and he reported to me on the proceedings. This was the first meeting at this level where the ten EU accession states participated as observers.The meeting included briefings on ongoing military aspects of ESDP. These included: the first EU led peace support operation, Operation Concordia, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the development of arrangements between the EU and NATO; initiatives of the Greek Presidency in relation to common training and space; and the development of civil protection initiatives in the event of terrorist attacks.The meeting reviewed progress on the military aspects of ESDP under the Greek Presidency and endorsed a report on military capabilities. Next Monday I will attend the capabilities conference where I expect this document will be discussed.

Following a survey of the fleet in late 1999, a small quantity of asbestos was found in the machinery spaces of the four offshore patrol vessels – LE Deirdre, LE Emer, LE Aoife and LE Aisling.In December 1999 specialist firms were contracted to remove the hazardous material under the supervision of a firm of environmental consultants. The work was carried out in late December 1999 and early January 2000. The asbestos was removed in accordance with standards approved by the Health and Safety Authority.With regard to buildings, the Department of Defence has been operating an asbestos management programme in all military posts, including the naval base at Haulbowline, County Cork, through the Office of Public Works. It is carried out by specialised contractors approved by the HSA under the guidance of consultants appointed by the Office of Public Works. It has been completed in respect of all buildings at the naval base.

Its main day-to-day role is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. It is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive fishery limit covering 132,000 square miles. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by two CASA maritime patrol aircraft. Fishery protection activity accounts for more than 90% of all service patrol time.The service supported by the Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft provides Ireland with an effective fishery protection service in accordance with our EU obligations and the requirements of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which has primary policy responsibility in this area. Recently a memorandum of understanding incorporating a service level agreement was concluded between the two Departments. It sets out agreed commitments in relation to fisheries protection and provides for the effective discharge of the Departments' respective obligations.

The agreed arrangements for the implementation of this recommendation provided, subject to certain conditions, for increases in pensions and gratuities to take account of MSA in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, the day following publication of the commission's report. This approach was consistent with settled public service pensions policy whereby the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.

These supports are allocated on an assessed basis and in line with my Department's criteria for the allocation of such supports. Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities receive the enhanced capitation grants and operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Special needs assistant support is also provided where required.There are currently 115 such classes for pupils with autism in the primary system. These include three special classes for pupils with Asperger's syndrome which is on the autistic spectrum. My Department allocates additional resources to individual second-level schools to cater for special needs pupils enrolled in those schools. Applications for resources are referred to the National Educational Psychological Service and each case is considered on its merits.There are seven facilities in the State delivering educational services on a pilot-project basis using alternative educational methods for teaching children on the autistic spectrum. The Government is committed to continuing to build on the unprecedented development of special education services, including services for pupils with autism, which has taken place in recent years.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	671	As I outlined in my previous answer, the conclusion of the NEPS representative who attended the case conference referred to by the Deputy was that it was not appropriate to allocate further resources to the child at that time. This was in the context that it was felt that an alternative school placement that might be more appropriate should be sought for the child. As reported by the Deputy, the Midlands Health Board autism team had recommended that he receive 15 hours per week resource teaching. The outcome of the NEPS recommendation has been that he receives five hours per week resource teaching plus full time support from a special needs assistant, pending the identification of a more suitable  educational setting for him. In other words, the child has been receiving one-to-one support for the entire school week.The midlands NEPS team has initiated a project to support schools where children with an autistic spectrum diagnosis are placed. The team has made great efforts to promote the welfare of this child and has monitored his progress on a regular basis. It has arranged in-service seminars for the teachers in these schools and has made follow up visits to them.On April 28, a meeting was held between two NEPS psychologists from the midlands region, the child's parents and the principal of the school that he attends. At this meeting, the child's mother stated that she did not wish him to transfer to an alternative placement and that she wanted him to stay in his present school. It was therefore decided that parents and school would liaise closely over the management of the child's behaviour and that NEPS would recommend an increased allocation of resource hours to my Department's special education section. This process is now in train.

Accordingly, the level of special needs assistant support they require is correspondingly reduced and is met through the allocation of part-time hours support. The duration of the service provided is based on the professionally-assessed needs of the individual children involved.Part-time special needs assistants are contracted to deliver a specified number of hours service per week in the schools in which they are employed and are paid at an hourly rate. The terms and conditions of employment for all special needs assistants is currently under review within my Department and, when the issues have been finalised, my Department will ensure that guidelines are issued to schools on the matter.

Subsequently, my Department agreed to extend the secondment for a further two years until the end of the 2002-03 school year to allow that person to work on promoting the manual and building links between teachers catering for children with special needs and the health service providers involved in this area. The extended period of secondment will conclude at the end of the current school year and my Department has advised the parties involved that a further extension will not be approved. In arriving at this decision, account has been taken of the imminent commencement of recruitment of staff to the National Council for Special Education. Among its duties, the council will undertake work of a similar nature on a national basis.

The school authorities were advised at that time that the question of permanent recognition would be considered when the Department was satisfied that long-term viability had been demonstrated and that the school was operating in accordance with the rules for national schools. Until such time as permanent recognition is granted to the school, my Department will not consider purchasing a site to permanently accommodate the school. If and when permanent recognition is granted, budgetary factors will then determine the rate of pro gress on the acquisition of a site and on the delivery of permanent accommodation for the school.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	687	I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 to 103 together.I presume the report referred to by the Deputy is that of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services, which was published in March 2002. Following the report's publication a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.Given the key role of the Health Boards Executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of: service imperatives; funding priorities; and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers.In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.Given these constraints, my Department, together with the directors of human resources in the health boards, is prioritising support for the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review group's report relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional post-graduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase from end-1999 to end-2002, from 26 to 83, in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services. This development, in enhancing graduate output, will help maintain an improved balance between demand and supply in human resource and service provision.My Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis, with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology, consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services as detailed in the joint review group's report and the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the Action Plan for People Management, published in November 2002.

However, health boards and specialist agencies in the health field have over the years developed some specialist pre-school services for children with disabilities and also facilitate, where possible in certain circumstances, children with disabilities or those from disadvantaged backgrounds in accessing community and private pre-school services.The development of policy and services for pre-school children, including those with disabilities, is a matter for the Department of Education and Science. I assure the Deputy that my Department, together with the health boards and specialist agencies, will provide whatever assistance they can to that Department in this matter.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	692	The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation here attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.As the Deputy is aware, I established the forum on fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was launched on 10 September 2002 and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. It also came to the following conclusions: water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that, at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected; dental fluorosis – a form of discoloration of the tooth enamel – is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	693	I presume the Deputy is referring to charges for long-stay accommodation. Charges for long-stay care in a health board institution can be made under two sets of regulations. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended bythe Health (Charges for In-Patient Services)(Amendment) Regulations 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. The regulations provide that a charge is made at a rate not exceeding the person's income. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges.Charges may also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1965, where the person receives "shelter and maintenance" rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all persons who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants.In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship. My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I can confirm that an appli cation was recently received in my Department from Kilkenny Youthlynx for funding for a proposed new young offenders development programme. I arranged for the views of the probation and welfare service to be sought on the proposals which were outlined in the correspondence. Senior officials from the service visited Kilkenny Youthlynx on 26 February 2003 and discussed the application with the manager of the centre.The probation and welfare service recognises the commitment that staff currently employed at Kilkenny Youthlynx display in undertaking their work. They also consider that the drop-in facility provided meets a real need as a place where persons with chaotic lifestyles can be comfortable and where they can begin the process of working on any problems they may have.In regard to the proposal itself, the probation and welfare service is of the view that the proposal as currently framed is somewhat general in nature and sets very ambitious targets which could well be difficult to attain. They consider that a more specific and narrowly focused approach, which has regard to the existing responsibilities of other agencies, and which would outline the contribution that a body such as Kilkenny Youthlynx could make, might be more realistic.Consideration by my Department of any recommendation from the probation and welfare service for funding for new proposals has to take into account the current availability of resources. On that point, there is, unfortunately, no realistic prospect of funding being available in the 2003 allocation to enable the probation and welfare service to support a new project such as that proposed by Kilkenny Youthlynx. A letter to this effect was issued from my office to Kilkenny Youthlynx on 9 May 2003.

Consequently, it is likely that the application of the person concerned will be finalised towards the end of this year. As soon as I have reached a decision on the matter, I will inform both the applicant and the Deputy of the outcome.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	707	Two sets of allegations of bullying and harassment made by employees of my Department at Glenveagh National Park are being processed at present. In both cases the persons making the allegations have named a number of individuals against whom the allegations are directed. One individual who has made allegations is himself the subject of allegations. It is estimated that the investigation will be completed by mid-July but this is contingent on the availability of both the independent investigator and all parties who are required to make statements.In so far as the overall time taken to conduct this investigation is concerned, I would refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 185 and 189 of 7 November 2002, in which I indicated that a suitably trained officer of my Department had been appointed to carry out the investigation. This arrangement had subsequently to be changed at the request of the person who made the first allegations on the basis that he should be treated no differently than a colleague whose allegations are also being investigated by independent experts. This change of investigators and the submission on 17 February 2003 of an additional list of incidents to be investigated caused unavoidable delays in the process.Up to the end of April the investigation has cost €2,570 on the basis of a daily rate and expenses. The total cost of the investigation will be dependent on the number of consultancy days required for its completion and the expenses involved.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	708	Since the enactment of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the making of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, guidance notes have issued to planning authorities by my Department on the implementation of the legislation. These included advice on the making of submissions by public representatives in relation to planning appli cations and the payment of the appropriate fee. Further guidelines on development control will be issued by my Department in the coming year, having regard to the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000.As regards codes of conduct, a comprehensive new ethics framework for local authority members and staff has been provided in the Local Government Act 2001 and came into operation on 1 January 2003. This framework will be further reinforced by separate statutory codes of conduct for staff and councillors of local authorities. These are currently being prepared and drafts will be available later this year.

As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department has a responsibility to ensure that all criteria are adhered to in administering grant schemes, particularly in relation to the submission by applicant groups of satisfactory accounts and documentation in respect of grants paid. With regard to the delay in processing the application from the organisation referred to by the Deputy, my Department has initiated an inspection of the books, records and returns of that organisation, relating to the usage of grants paid in 2000 under the scheme. Pending the resolution of the applications and accounts process for the year 2000, consideration of applications for subsequent years from the organisation has been deferred.Due to discrepancies in the material supplied, it is not possible to confirm the precise number of outstanding applications which relate to the years 2000, 2001 and 2002. However, having regard to the level of discrepancies, the likely number of applicants is estimated to be in the region of 2,000. When the result of the current inspection has been finalised, consideration will then be given to processing outstanding applications from the organisation concerned.

The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides assistance to people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. In determining entitlement to a payment under the scheme the health board must be satisfied that a need exists which cannot be met from other sources and the need merits the award of a payment under the scheme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	712	The person concerned applied for old age contributory pension on 7 April 2003. She has been awarded pension at the 75% rate on the basis of a yearly average of 15 contributions over the relevant period with effect from 21 November 1997.Arrears of pension for the period 21 November 1997 to 5 April 2001, less the amount already paid to her husband in respect of her for this period, will be issued to her shortly. From 21 November 1997 to 5 April 2001 she was financially better off in receipt of a contributory pension in her own right. However, from 6 April 2001, the allowance in payment to her husband in respect of her as a qualified adult was greater than the pension to which she is entitled. In these circumstances, the allowance will continue to be paid to her husband in lieu of her pension as this is more advantageous to the couple.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-15 00:00:00	Prelude	713	The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 17 September 2001 and during the periods from 18 February 2002 to 27 March 2002 and from 8 April 2002 to 31 May 2002 while she was a full time student. As a result a deciding officer decided that she was not entitled to payment for these periods. Accordingly, she has been assessed with an overpayment of €1,661.49.The person concerned has appealed this decision and the appeals officer is of the opinion that an oral hearing is necessary. This will be arranged as soon as possible. Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.
