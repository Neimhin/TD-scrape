#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	0	In recent months members of the Government, including the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, have travelled around the country and abroad, and have made perfectly plain that it is the Government's intention to take out €1.3 billion from the public sector pay bill without compromising services.  Is the Taoiseach still committed to taking out €1.3 billion from the public service pay bill without compromising services?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1	It remains the objective of Government to effect savings of that order vis-à-vis the public sector pay bill for 2009 compared to 2010.  The Government has made clear that the public service pay bill must make a substantial contribution to the fiscal adjustment required for next year.  This is a structural adjustment and, therefore, the savings will be permanent.The public services committee of ICTU proposed to the Government that this adjustment could be made without imposing cuts in pay rates.  This would be based on commitments to a smaller, more efficient and more flexible public service to be achieved in line with the objectives set out in the Government Statement on Transforming Public Services.  Discussions on these proposals have been continuing with the trade unions, which have proposed as a bridging measure pending completion of the various efficiency measures involved in transformation that there would be an agreed reduction in pay rates in 2010 and that this commitment to change would be recognised by permitting staff to take 12 days of unpaid leave over a period of years on a basis that it did not disrupt the delivery of services.Proposals emerging from the discussions were considered by the Government yesterday and it was indicated to the unions that they did not in their present form provide a basis for the Government to confirm that it would not consider other options to effect the necessary savings.  The public service unions responded by indicating they wished to continue to develop their proposals and I welcome the fact that in that context the planned day of industrial action for tomorrow has been postponed.The Government will consider any further proposals emerging from current discussions.  I want to make clear, however, that a basis for agreement will only exist if the scale of reduction in the public service pay bill is sufficient, if it is clearly seen to be permanent in character and if any transitional arrangements do not impact negatively on services as assessed by public service management.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	3	It seems as if the Government has abdicated its responsibility to sort out the economic mess into which it has led us.  It is not possible to get permanent savings by having a further 12 days' holidays.  It is not possible to give the same level of service with 5% less man-hours.The detail available to Opposition parties, such as it is, leads me to believe that what the Taoiseach is talking about is grossly unfair.  Where is the fairness in a situation where a person on the minimum wage will have the same proportion of cut as somebody on €100,000, and give up 5% of his or her income?  How is it fair that ordinary families with children at school will suffer as a consequence of this?  How is it fair that the unemployed will have less chance of getting a job when the capital budget is cut?  How is it fair that children who are vulnerable will be at risk now because of fewer social work hours being worked by social workers and those in the social services?  There is no sense of fairness in what the Taoiseach is talking about and it seems as if the commitment given by himself and the Minister for Finance has been nothing but words again.  Even ten days ago the newspapers reported that the Taoiseach was not for turning on pay.How many gardaí will be taken off the beat as a consequence of this?  How many operations will be cancelled?  How many classes will be left without teachers?  How many children will be put at risk because of fewer social workers working 5% less hours?  Where is the sense of fairness in what the Taoiseach is talking about?

If Deputy Kenny's wants to promulgate some other version of events, that is obviously for his own political purposes.  What I am interested in, and this Government is interested in,——

The level of savings that we seek to obtain remains of the order of €1.3 billion in terms of a reduction between the cost of the public service pay bill this year compared to next year.  That remains our position and we wish to discuss with the trade unions on that basis.  Those discussions are not complete.  As I stated, proposals still must be discussed and developed.  However, I made clear what the Government's position is and we reserve our position until we see if we can find an agreement.  Otherwise, we must consider other options.

Some of the strident voices that appear to wish for conflict are not helping the situation.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, the Labour Party has been arguing for quite some months that the reductions in the public service pay bill should be achieved by way of a negotiated agreement which would involve significant public service reform.  The difficulty the Taoiseach is in is that he did not engage in those discussions until the eleventh hour.  There was not serious engagement until after the first strike.  The Taoiseach appeared to be too interested in listening to some of the hardline commentators who appear to be pumped up on the steroids of conflict rather than in engaging seriously at an early stage.  He is now in a situation where there is a very narrow period of time within which agreement can be reached.What is the Taoiseach's intention here?  Does he intend to conclude an agreement before the budget?  Does he accept that any agreement which is negotiated will have to be put to a ballot?  He is now in a situation that such a ballot will have to take place after the budget and may, in turn, be influenced by its content.  Has the Taoiseach considered what his position will be if an agreement is not accepted in a ballot?  I heard his reply to Deputy Kenny, that he is still seeking €1.3 billion in savings, which presumably will be reflected one way or another in next week's Budget Statement.  How will the Taoiseach achieve that €1.3 billion in savings if there is no agreement?Can the Taoiseach explain his point about unpaid leave being taken over a period of years?  I understood from his reply to Deputy Kenny that the formula he is now proposing to agree is one whereby there will, in effect, be a cut in pay in 2010.  However, the corresponding leave which is to be negotiated to allow that to happen may be taken over a number of years.  Is the Taoiseach saying that the pay reduction will take effect in 2010, but that the leave arrangements might not be taken until 2011 or 2012?  I heard one trade union leader say this morning that it might even be out to 2013.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	15	It has always been the position of this Government that it is preferable, if possible, to obtain an agreed way forward, in the interests of maintaining services, by proceeding with adjustments which are necessary in the budgetary context and to which the Government remains committed.As regards these negotiations, it was at the unions' request that they sought to put before the Government policy options, other than a cut in basic rates, as a means of providing the necessary savings.  Those discussions are continuing.  I have been in discussions and have kept a close brief on all these negotiations.  As regards the proposals based on the review the Government undertook yesterday, I want to acknowledge the progress that people have made, the effort that is being made and the good faith in which people are seeking to proceed.  None of that is in question.  As an employer, the Government has a duty to see if there are proposals that are capable of meeting its objectives and doing it on an agreed basis.

Until they do, we do not have the basis for an agreement, but we want to continue with those discussions.The third point is that the savings will be in 2010.  They will be permanent on the basis that the Government is not in a position to continue with a public service pay bill of the quantum that currently exists given our current budgetary position.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	22	As regards the proposals, which are emerging from the continuing discussions, on how to ensure that one does not disrupt services, it may be required in some instances — if this were to be developed into a proposal that provided the means of an acceptable solution — for people to take that leave back over a period of years.  That would be precisely to avoid a disruption of services.If we are to provide an agreed way forward, it will have to be before the budget because the Minister for Finance will be coming into the House with his budget on the basis of what amounts he will have available for public service pay and pensions next year.  I have said that there will have to be a reduction in the 2010 figure for that particular bill, substantially less than it is at the moment, of the order of the €1.3 billion we have sought as an objective.  That remains the position.  In the meantime, efforts are being made to see if there is an agreed way forward on how to do that.  In the meantime, the Government is reserving its position.

He does not know whether he will get an agreement with the trade unions between now and budget day on 9 December because he has left the negotiations far too late.  Second, he has not been able to tell me what will happen if he secures an agreement on paper before budget day, but that agreement is subsequently rejected in a ballot.  He has now boxed himself into a situation where the ballot on any agreement that is concluded will take place in the aftermath of the budget.  Third, the Taoiseach is also telling us that while savings will be made in 2010, the impact on services arising from those savings may not take place until 2011, 2012 or whenever the staff concerned decide to take the unpaid leave.  That would appear to compromise the Taoiseach's prospects of securing longer-term reform in the public services in the years ahead.

I would like to get some clarity on this because this day week, presumably, we will hear from the Minister for Finance that there is a reduction in the public sector pay bill of €1.3 billion.  At the moment, however, there does not seem to be any basis for that.  The Taoiseach may or may not have an agreement by this day week.  Even if he has, he has left it so late that he does not know whether that agreement will be confirmed in a subsequent ballot.  While the Taoiseach might get the financial savings in 2010, there may be a longer-term impact on services in the subsequent years.  From what he is saying, he does not appear to have a position on what will happen if there is no agreement.  How will he get €1.3 billion in savings if he finds himself this day week either with no agreement or with one that he is unsure will be confirmed in a subsequent ballot?

It is a question not only of dealing with the 2010 issue, but also of dealing with the need for an integrated public service that will be smaller over a period of time.  It will have all the flexibility on redeployment that we need in order to effect modern public services as envisaged in the Transforming Public Services document.  There is no lack of clarity about it.  The position is very simple.

Through facilitating a "whole of Government" approach it seeks to add value to social policy considerations and actions by promoting co-ordination and cohesion across sectoral policies and strategies.  This is pursued particularly through the management of the work of the various Cabinet committees and senior officials groups across a range of social policy issues such as social inclusion, labour market, health and disability.In addition, the social policy unit represents my Department and actively contributes to several interdepartmental groups covering a range of social policy matters including the national women's strategy, positive aging strategy, national drugs strategy and Travellers.  The unit maintains ongoing liaison with Departments and contacts with stakeholder interests such as the community and voluntary pillar of social partnership.  In addition, the work of the steering group on active citizenship is supported from within the social policy unit.The unit is also involved on an ongoing basis with a wide spectrum of activity covering social policy matters, including the preparation of briefings for me on proposals in Government memorandums for meetings and correspondence as well as the range of administrative responsibilities relevant to Government offices.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  He has said the social policy unit works closely with other Departments to advance social inclusion.  Is the Department of Finance one of the Departments it works closely with and if so, has the social policy unit had an input into decision making as regards the social welfare provisions of the budget next week?  If it did, what weight did it carry?  Was it a case of it just saying, in effect, "We need to be careful about the social inclusion aspect of the removal of the Christmas bonus and its impact on pensioners, children and so on".  Was this conveyed strongly by the social policy unit to the Minister for Finance, to emphasise the enormous negative impact this will present for pensioners and children, in particular, around Christmas time?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The social policy unit deals with all of these issues and there are Cabinet committees that some of its personnel attend, as I do.  The unit interacts on an ongoing basis with various groups representing stakeholder interests on all of these issues.  The question of the budget, obviously, is determined ultimately by the Minister of Finance based on consultations and discussions with colleagues.  I am proud that over many years we have seen social welfare budgets increase way in excess of the cost of living, as the budgetary position allowed.  We have to look at all areas of expenditure in the context of next week's budget to meet the €4 billion savings objective necessary in the present circumstances.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I have a brief supplementary question.  Is it just a token unit?  We know it was established as part of the social partnership initiative.  Is it just there for the purpose of ticking a box, or does it have any weight?  Does the Taoiseach require the other Departments to have any regard for what the social policy unit in his Department says to them?  I specifically ask this about the Department of Finance, because that is the most critical one.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The role of the Department of the Taoiseach is to co-ordinate, in many instances, various policy strands or interdepartmental responsibilities in terms of evolving policy and preparing memorandums for Government and so on for the various Ministers in charge of particular areas.  The social policy unit is an active participant in all of that work.  It is very well regarded and has done excellent work.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Has the social policy unit produced any assessments of the proposals that have been floating around in respect of the social welfare measures that might be taken in the budget?  Has it, for example, done an assessment on the proposal I understand the Government intends to proceed with, namely, to cut in some form or other the levels of child benefit?  Did it carry out any assessment of the Government's decision to abolish the Christmas bonus for pensioners and others?  What assessment has it done on the rapid rise in unemployment over the course of the past year?While I am on that subject, I understand the live register figures are due to be published at 11 a.m.  Could the Taoiseach please tell the House what the live register figures are, which will be published in the next few minutes and what assessment the social policy unit has given of that level of unemployment?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I do not have those figures with me, this morning.  From memory, however, having looked at them last night, I understand there is an increase of 7,000.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	47	An increase of 7,000.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I believe so, but I shall have to check.  It might be less, but I shall have to check, because I have been reading quite a number of documents in the last while.  In any event, the live register figures will be published at 11 a.m., as the Deputy says.In the Department of the Taoiseach a "whole of Government" approach is adopted.  When assessing impact on social welfare measures, for example, this will be done in the normal manner by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and such data will be provided on the day as part of the budgetary documentation in many instances.On the question of the Christmas bonus, that was a decision which was taken and outlined in the last budget.  Taking into account the increases that have been made in social welfare in the past two budgets, the net increase has been well in excess of the decrease in the cost of living, which has been witnessed this year for the first time in many decades.  Those points will have been made.  One must also take into account a background since 2004-05 of inflation of less than 12% where the increase in the pension has been more than 51% in that period, equivalent to 4.5 times the increase in the cost of living.On basic rates, the percentage there for inflation at the rate of 11.9%  for that period is more than 37%.  Quite rightly, at times when resources were available, we sought to assist those on welfare payments, significantly.  Whatever decisions have to be taken on welfare rates now or in the future will be taken against a background of that significant advance during times when resources were available.For the accuracy of the record, I understand that the November live register will see a month on month increase of 1,100 or 0.3% since October 2009.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	49	It is very disappointing to hear again that there is an increase in the level of unemployment.  Last month's figures suggested that there might be some bottoming out in the unemployment level and job losses.  Now we are hearing again of an increase — 1,100 on last month — and we have had announcements of job losses in recent weeks.  It is a story of continuing economic difficulties here, while there are some signs of recovery in other economies.I am unclear as to what the social policy unit in the Department of the Taoiseach does.  What does it do that the Department of Social and Family Affairs cannot do?  Will the Taoiseach give the House some idea as to the size of the unit, and what it costs?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I do not have the cost of it.  It is a unit in the Department headed by an assistant secretary.  She and her staff do excellent work and are well regarded in the whole social policy area.  She advises me, as Taoiseach, on social policy matters and helps in the preparation of Cabinet committee meetings in the areas of responsibility that come under the aegis of the unit.She also provides, ensures and seeks to promote a whole of Government approach to all issues such as the national disability strategy or the question on how Travellers' policy is dealt with.   There has been much improvement on the disability issue and the bringing forward of offices led by Ministers of State to provide cross-departmental functions has been a success.  I refer in particular to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the office pertaining to disabilities.  Issues regarding the labour market or broad social inclusion are obvious areas for which any Department of the Taoiseach would be obliged to have a competence and capacity.  It does its work well.As for the live register, the year-on-year increase continues to fall.  The year-on-year increase was 194,000, 189,000 and 146,000 in June, August and November 2009, respectively.  While one would wish to see a continuation of this trend, it is taking place against a serious rise in unemployment rates, as has been evident in the past 12 months.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The point is that when seasonal factors are taken into account, the month-on-month increase is 800, whereas it is important to note that the equivalent month-on-month increase for November last year was approximately 16,200.  If the Deputy is asking whether something approaching a bottoming-out is evident, thankfully we are not experiencing the rate of job losses that took place this time 12 months ago.  This of course constitutes a continuing challenge for this country as it seeks to regain competitiveness in a context in which international markets are less buoyant than was the case previously.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	53	One stated aim of the social policy unit within the Department of the Taoiseach is the identification "of emerging trends and policy issues and proposing new initiatives and responses".  What evidence has the social policy unit provided to the Taoiseach of emerging trends and what policy issues have been identified?  What new initiatives have been proposed by the unit?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	54	As I stated previously in respect of issues such as disability, health, the fair deal scheme and the national drugs strategy, the social policy unit has played a role in this regard.  It ensures the views of the Department of the Taoiseach are inputted into all the aforementioned areas.  Basically, that co-ordinating role, using the authority of the Department of the Taoiseach is its function.  Policy regarding social and family affairs or health and children is dealt with by the relevant line Minister.  However, the job of the social policy unit of the Department of the Taoiseach is to advise the Taoiseach on all these issues as they arise and to use its office and position as a means of bringing together a whole of Government approach, where necessary, in the event of initiatives being taken in a particular area.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I was interested in what new initiatives the unit has proposed to the Taoiseach, as one of its stated aims is to propose new initiatives to the Taoiseach.  Has the unit provided the Taoiseach with new initiatives or has it made proposals in that regard?  Following on from the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Gilmore, I am sure he is aware of the difficulties that so many people now face.  It appears as though the words of the Minister for Finance no longer will have any meaning.  On the issues of social inclusion and social welfare, it is clear that some categories of welfare recipients simply cannot work because of their circumstances.  I refer, for example, to children, pensioners, the disabled, carers and so on.  Has the unit within the Taoiseach's Department identified the pressures on such people to ensure they will not receive a savage hit in the budget next week?  At the same time, has the unit advised the Taoiseach that, in view of the increase in the numbers of unemployed people, unless some fiscal stimulus is injected into the economy for the protection and creation of jobs, the position will worsen?  Has the unit proposed new initiatives to the Taoiseach in this regard, which is central to its supposed aim?  Unless the Government gets this right, the numbers of unemployed people will continue to grow.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	56	The Deputy will hear from the Minister for Finance next week on all these issues regarding Government decisions and plans.  This particular unit has been involved in the activation of areas pertaining to enterprise supports and support for the unemployed.  It has an input in such questions and has helped to bring together various Departments, such as the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as a means of bringing forward proposals for the Government to consider in the context of what is an extremely tight budgetary situation.  Moreover, to suggest that the policy unit is in some way superfluous to requirements is to miss the point completely.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I did not suggest that.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I am making the point——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I am asking the Taoiseach what new initiatives it has proposed.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	60	As for the initiatives it has dealt with, it was, for example, centrally involved in the disability strategy, as well as in the policy for travellers and so on.  It also has been involved in implementing such initiatives and ensuring that they can be dealt with by liaising with Departments to ensure that such issues continue to be part of their policy goals and how resources are spent.  While it has that brief, it is not in the business of initiating the policy of the Department of Social and Family Affairs or of doing everyone else's job.  It is a question of co-ordinating the jobs of various Departments in order that a coherent position exists across all these issues with regard to disability and social inclusion generally, as well as assisting with that process of policy development.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	61	This unit within the Taoiseach's Department could play an important and useful role if, for instance, it was to address the issue of the growing rate of unemployment of young people.  I understand that at present, somewhere between one fifth and one quarter of those on the live register——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Can we have a question please?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Allow me to continue.  Between one fifth and one quarter of those on the live register are young people under 25, most of whom are male.  A crisis also exists regarding the governance of FÁS, to which €1 billion will be allocated in next week's budget.  The Taoiseach referred to this unit as being cross-cutting and as identifying emerging trends and policy issues.  It is able to give the stamp of a Taoiseach in power to efforts to pull together different Departments, which is not a bad idea.  Should the Taoiseach not lead a drive against what is happening to young people who are only being offered the dole by the Government?  There are very few places, no internships, no training and nothing for the private or public sectors or NGOs to take on young people and give them a chance for working opportunities.  Would this unit not be the ideal mechanism under the Taoiseach's leadership to further such a drive?  I note that Professor Blanchflower of the IMF was in Dublin two weeks ago.  All the evidence from the last recession and recessions globally is that if a young person, particularly a young man, goes on the dole at 18 or 19, six months of unemployment turns into a year, which then becomes a year and a half.  Those affected do not build up experience and consequently cannot get work, even when the upturn comes, because they are not fitted for it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	64	It has been suggested that no training is available.  There has been a substantial increase in the number of places provided this year.  As for FÁS, the agency now is under the leadership of a new chief executive and is proceeding with its work.  It is dealing with the issues that arose in respect of the governance questions and is getting on with its business.  The new incumbent should be allowed to do so and I am sure he has the support of all Members in bringing forward that organisation in a way that will assist public confidence in it.  Since the beginning of the year, there has been a reallocation of substantial additional resources to boost job search, training, work experience and educational opportunities.  The Government effectively has doubled the job search referral capacity from 6,500 to 12,250 per month, bringing the total number of places for referral by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to 147,000 per year.  The Government has increased the total number of training places provided by FÁS for this year to a total of 128,000, as against 66,000 cases taken up last year.  Specific provisions have been made for apprenticeships to further their apprenticeships and provision has been made of more than 6,000 additional places in further and higher education.  There has been significantly improved access to supports for individual enterprises through back-to-work and back-to-education schemes, which the Deputy is aware have seen a good take-up.  It is not correct to claim initiatives have not been taken in this area.  They continue to be taken——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Taoiseach should walk around some housing estates to see young men outside on the roads.  It has not been like that for years.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Deputy Burton please.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I am explaining the facts.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I am making the point. I am not suggesting that everyone who wants a place gets one.  There has been a serious increase in resources in this area which Deputy Burton is not prepared to acknowledge.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	71	There are massive social problems in these housing estates.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	72	In his reply to me earlier, the Taoiseach sought to put a gloss on the live register figures by representing them as though they were an improvement.  I have the new figures released just a few minutes ago.  The seasonally adjusted figure for the numbers on the live register for November 2009 stands at 423,400.  That is the highest November figure ever.  It is 236,000 more than were on the live register at the time of the general election.  There is no basis for the Taoiseach putting a gloss on these figures or trying to suggest to the House that somehow they represent some kind of an improvement.  It is a disgraceful and scandalously high level of unemployment.  This large increase has taken place on the Taoiseach's watch.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I did no such thing.  The Deputy asked a question unrelated to the subject of the original questions——
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	74	It is not unrelated.  What is the social policy unit to do if it cannot deal with unemployment?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	75	These were not specific questions to unemployment figures.  I accept the Deputy is entitled to ask a supplementary question, which he did about unemployment, but I did not put any gloss on the live register figures.  I explained them when I got them from the Chief Whip.  I gave the Deputy the figures as presented in front of me.  I have never suggested there is a gloss to be put on unemployment figures.  Anyone out of work is one too many as all Deputies know.  I gave the figures as was requested by Deputy Gilmore.  If I did not give them to him, it would be another problem.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I am sure the social inclusion unit in the Taoiseach's Department makes some valuable recommendations.  Deputy Catherine Byrne reminded me of the Liberties recycling programme which trains those who were once involved in drugs.  When the community employment or FÁS scheme for these trainees ends, no other programmes are available to them.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Deputy Kenny, it seems to me that some of these questions are more appropriate to the line Ministers.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	78	A Cheann Comhairle, it is in cases such as this on which the social policy unit of the Taoiseach's Department should be focused.  Those in the Liberties recycling programme have been weaned off drugs, received an element of re-training and have a new focus in their lives.  When their programme finishes, however, no other programmes are available to them and the danger is that they will drift back into their previous cycle of drug misuse.  Does the social inclusion policy unit focus on groups such as the Liberties recycling programme, highlighted on television the other evening, and the value of such courses?  Does it make recommendations to the Taoiseach that such programmes have real impact on people's lives for their benefit and should be continued?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The national drugs strategy was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, on 10 September last.  Its overall objective, which was developed following an extensive consultation process, is to continue to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  The strategy's budget of €275 million is spent directly on drugs services and programmes across a range of Departments and State agencies.  There have been 100 drug-specific projects in 24 local and regional drugs taskforce areas covering the country.  The new Office of the Minister for Drugs, in operation since 1 September, streamlines service administration and further improves co-ordination across the statutory, community and voluntary pillars.Significant moneys, €275 million, have been allocated in tackling this serious problem for many communities.  A strategy is in place after extensive consultation with all groups and stakeholders involved.  The policy approach is extensive, updated and relevant to the needs identified by the stakeholders.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.The question relates to the findings of the Quigley report, published in 2005.  It highlighted the need for special care in cases where a proposed consultancy comprises an element of direct service to a Minister or Minister of State, particularly in the public relations or communications area, and where a Minister or a Minister of State suggests the name of a person or enterprise as being suitable.Following publication of the Quigley report, additional guidelines to be followed in such cases were approved by the Government and are published on my Department's website.  The guidelines were brought to the attention of all Secretaries General, who were asked to implement them and to bring them in future to the attention of all newly-appointed Ministers, Ministers of State where relevant, in their Department or office.The guidelines give the Secretary General to the Government and the Government secretariat a role in examining certain procurements.  However, there is no special committee in my Department to oversee the awarding of public relations contracts by Ministers.  Any workload arising from the application of these additional guidelines is handled within existing resources in the Government secretariat.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	81	In July 2008, the Minister for Finance said all expenditure by Department and State agencies on consultancies, advertising and public relations contracts would be cut by at least 50%.  I note radio advertisements costing over €23,000 were recently put out by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announcing the special protection of seven areas in County Dublin.  This was one of several campaigns run by his Department which has spent over €3 million on advertising in 2009 alone.Were these contracts, and others like them, approved by the public relations contracts committee?  Is there ever an evaluation of media advertising campaigns as to their impact, how many people were reached, whether they made sense to people or had consequential benefits?  Has the public relations committee any capacity to evaluate the effect and the value for money of advertising campaigns carried out by Ministers, Ministers of State and Departments?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	82	No, those assessments are carried out by the line Departments.  There are many public information notices and campaigns which are necessary to bring to the attention of citizens.  They cover issues such as statutory requirements and matters of public importance in particular areas.In July 2008 the Minister for Finance announced a 50% reduction in departmental consultancy expenditure.  It should also be noted that in February 2009 he announced a further reduction across Departments of €25 million in expenditure on advertising, public relations and consultancies.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	83	If the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, wants to launch a campaign about, say, new sports facilities and wishes to award a contract to a public relations agency for it, what process must he go through?  Does he have to contact the Taoiseach's Department?  Does he just consult with his Secretary General and award a contract on the basis of tenders received by his Department?

Has the Taoiseach put his oar into other Departments?  Must they obtain authorisation and permission from the Taoiseach's Department before awarding or renewing public relations contracts?  In other words, what is the current procedure in this regard?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I refer the Deputy to the Quigley report and the recommendations and conclusions therein which set out the advice and procedures to be adopted in various circumstances.  The purpose of this report was to bring clarity to the issue and to ensure that Ministers and officeholders are aware of arrangements for the future.  I refer the Deputy to the conclusions of that report.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Does the Taoiseach have the overall figure for expenditure in 2009 by members of the Government on public relations contracts?  If the work of the committee is to oversee the awarding of public relations contracts, does the Taoiseach have an overall figure for what will be spent be end 2009 by line Departments and the Government in general on public relations contracts?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The guidelines given to the Secretary General of Government and Government secretariat relate to the examination of certain procurements.  As such, there is no committee overseeing the awarding of public relations contracts by Ministers.  The matter is dealt with by the secretariat.  I do not have available the figures requested by the Deputy.In July 2008, the Minister for Finance sought a reduction of 50% in consultancy expenditure and, in February 2009, brought in an additional requirement for a further €25 million reduction in expenditure and advertising in respect of public relations and consultancy contracts.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	91	My understanding of the guidelines published in 2005 following the Quigley report is that the appointment of a particular person, consultant or public relations firm by a Minister would be referred to the Government secretariat for consideration and that if it had some issues it wished to raise in that regard, the Secretary General would make a recommendation to the Taoiseach as to whether any special procurement procedures should be observed in the procurement process.On how many occasions has the appointment of a particular person or public relations firm been considered by the Government secretariat in line with the guidelines published in 2005?  Also, on how many occasions has a recommendation been made to the Taoiseach in regard to whether any special procurement arrangements should be applied?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I do not recall any instances having been brought to my attention.  The guidelines are being observed.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.As my predecessor indicated to the House on 3 October 2007 and on 8 April 2008, and as I indicated on 12 November 2008 and on 27 May 2009 in response to similar questions, the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Nally report in regard to the reorganisation of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor was completed in 2007.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	94	In regard to the Director of Public Prosecutions——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I remind Deputy Kenny that questions in regard to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are outside the scope of questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	96	How many people are currently employed in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor?  What is the position in terms of that office meeting the Taoiseach's demands for a reduction in staffing levels?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The following is the situation in respect of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor as a result of the Nally report.  Approval was given in January 2007 for the recruitment of 16 additional staff.  The office currently has an authorised staffing level of 249 full-time equivalents and has a total of 233 full-time equivalent staff serving in the office and is carrying two vacancies.  Like all Departments and offices, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is subject to reductions in expenditure, staff numbers and retirements under the early retirement scheme.  The office has reduced its staff by 14 posts and is currently carrying two vacancies.  As such, 249 less 14 plus the two vacancies equates to 233 serving staff.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Is work from the Chief State Solicitor's office being outsourced?  Is all of the body of work carried out  by that office undertaken in-house or is it being contracted to outside agencies and so on?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The Deputy will be aware that much work in a solicitor's office is dealt with by counsel in terms of the preparation of briefs where cases in litigation are being taken and that this may require the employment of barristers and so on.  Obviously, this type of work — if one wishes to call it that — is outsourced.  The office conducts its own administrative arrangements and legal requirements, as in the case of any other solicitor's office.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	100	An bord snip nua made recommendations in respect of the Office of the Chief State's Solicitor to the effect that savings of €400,000 be achieved through the suppression of vacancies and efficiencies in external legal services and other administrative expenses.  What consideration has been given to this recommendation and how will its implementation be squared with the conclusions of the Nally report?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	101	All of those issues are considered in the context of there being fewer staff than authorised in that office.  A reduction by way of 14 qualified staff, depending on their grade and work, would equate to that amount.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	106	In an effort to facilitate a request from the Opposition yesterday, we reduced the time for debate on this Bill on the basis that it would allow more time for statements on climate change.  I am now surprised to hear, having explained that this Bill had to be enacted prior to Christmas for the reasons outlined, which are well known to the spokespersons, that there is a problem in this regard.  So much for co-operation.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	107	So much for not bringing it in on time.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Could we have some ciúnas in the House, please?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	109	May I ask the Taoiseach two questions?  This year, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, Deputy Seán Barrett, and the committee produced a worthy offshore renewable energy development Bill.  However, it has not appeared on the Government's implementation agenda.  Does the Government intend to include it, in light of its importance in terms of jobs and potential development?No. 51 on the Government list is a climate change Bill.  The Government will be sending representatives to the Copenhagen conference, but the Bill is not expected to be published until 2010.  In light of the importance attached to climate change and its implications by the EU, in view of the statements of Ministers in the House and if we are serious about these matters, will the Bill's production be given extra priority?Yesterday, I mentioned the Committee of the Regions to the Taoiseach.  Since the current committee's remit has ended, will the Taoiseach have consultations on a fairer and more representative membership of the new committee, given the change in numbers arising from how people voted in the June elections?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The latter is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Regarding the climate change Bill, it is expected next year.  The other Bill mentioned by the Deputy is a Private Members' Bill, which is its status at the moment.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	111	On that point, will provision be made in the Government's legislative list for Bills produced by all-party committees?  They do not conform to normal Private Members' Bills.  The Bill in question is not a Private Members' Bill.  Rather, it is a Oireachtas joint committee Bill produced via an all-party approach.  There is no provision in the manner in which legislation is presented to show that our Bill is hovering around the place.  Could I respectfully suggest that some provision be made in the legislative programme for legislation produced by committees, which would allow Bills' progress to be monitored?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Whether the Government supports any Bill from whatever source depends on the Government giving consideration to those matters.  There are many all-party recommendations from committees on a whole range of issues, reports, etc., that must be considered by Government in due course.  It does not denote prior approval by Government in every respect of the issue involved, whether it is legislation or otherwise.  The only point I can make to the Deputy is that we can take up the matter with the Minister concerned to see what is the situation.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	113	Only four sitting days have been scheduled after the budget, which will be announced this day week.  Four days is a short period for a debate on a budget, particularly one that we expect will be exceptional.  In addition, the Taoiseach replied to me to the effect that it may be necessary to have a social welfare Bill brought through the Houses and enacted before the Christmas recess if any changes to social welfare payments are to take effect at the beginning of the year.  In response to the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill last night, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs confirmed to the House that there will be cuts in social welfare, which would appear to necessitate a social welfare Bill before Christmas.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	114	We cannot discuss the budget now.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I am discussing arrangements for the House's sitting.  Is there clarity on whether there will be a social welfare Bill before Christmas?  Does the Government plan to allow sitting days before Christmas in addition to the scheduled four?  It is a small number.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I am not aware of any other plans beyond what is scheduled at the moment.  Clearly, if there are any changes in social welfare, a Bill would have to be enacted in time for them coming into operation.  This would have to be done and is the normal position.  A budget debate can be resumed in some instances beyond the period in which we are at the moment.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	117	We are going to have to discuss the arrangements for the budget debate and for any social welfare Bill that is introduced.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	118	That is a matter for the Whips.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	119	No, it is about——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	120	They are going to deliberate on that.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	121	With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, I am entitled to ask questions about the arrangements for sittings and the conduct of business.  The Government has created a set of circumstances in which the date of the budget has been put back to 9 December, thereby leaving a very short period of time for a debate on the budget.  It appears there may be a political strategy to get the budget, and possibly the social welfare Bill, done and dusted by Christmas in the hope that people may forget about them, or get over them, during the Christmas period.  In any event, four days is not a sufficient period of time for a debate in the House on the budget.  It is certainly not a sufficient period of time for a debate on the social welfare Bill, if such a Bill is to be published before Christmas.  With just a week to go until budget day, I ask the Taoiseach to outline the consideration the Government has given to the sitting arrangements between now and Christmas.  The Government has decided that the Minister for Finance will give his Budget Statement on 9 December, rather than 2 December which would have been the expected date.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I have indicated the position to the Deputy.  The budget is taking place on 9 December.  We will have a budget debate.  A social welfare Bill will also have to be enacted, to bring the budgetary decisions into operation.  The Government's only strategy involves making the budgetary adjustments that are necessary to maintain a credible budgetary strategy and enacting legislation in a timely fashion on the basis of the decisions that are made.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	123	We have spent a long time on this issue.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	124	In fairness to the Taoiseach, this is the first time he has acknowledged that there will be a social welfare Bill before Christmas.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	125	The Deputy is wrong.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	126	We now know what that means.  It will not suffice to provide for four sitting days on which to debate the budget and the social welfare Bill.  I would like the Taoiseach to set out, before we break at the end of this week, details of satisfactory sitting arrangements for the rest of this session.  If he is not in a position to do so today, perhaps he will direct the Tánaiste to do so tomorrow.  A satisfactory amount of time will have to be provided for a debate on the budget and the social welfare Bill that has now been promised.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I am sure the Whips will consider the matter, as they do every week.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	128	It is not the Ceann Comhairle's job to answer that.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	129	As I have said, the budget debate often continues beyond the immediate aftermath of the budget, or the week of the budget.  In my experience, that has been the normal practice in the past.  A social welfare Bill is always required in the aftermath of a budget to provide for any social welfare changes that may be demanded.  We will have to do that in a manner that is consistent with the budgetary strategy that will be outlined by the Minister for Finance next week.  If legislation is needed after the budget has been passed, that will have to happen.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	130	During the course of this Dáil session I, like several other Members of the House, have asked about the degree of priority being accorded by the Government to the introduction of a Bill to provide for the collection and exchange of information relating to the endangerment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Is the Deputy referring to promised legislation?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The Ceann Comhairle can be sure that I am.  When I finish my sentence, he will have heard it.  I was asking about the Bill that will provide for the exchange of information relating to the endangerment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse, or risk thereof, of children.  The Bill in question, the child care (collection and exchange of information) Bill, is No. 60 on the Government list.  It has been promised repeatedly in this House that the Bill will be published in 2010.  Is the introduction of that legislation in this House, to facilitate a full debate on this issue and its implications, not a matter of urgency for the Government in the current climate?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I am sure the Deputy will be aware of the statements made in the last week, following the publication of the Murphy report, by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, about the status of the legislation in question.  The heads of the Bill are being prepared in the Department of Health and Children as a matter of priority.  The Minister of State hopes to bring those heads to the Government for its approval within the next month or so.  He will continue to work on the detailed drafting of the Bill thereafter.  He will introduce the legislation as soon as practicable and possible.  During yesterday's debate on the Murphy report, I outlined in detail the considerations that will have to be taken into account as the legislation is being prepared.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I want to try to facilitate the large number of Members who are offering.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	138	With all due respect, this issue has been raised by virtually everybody on all sides of this House.  While I fully accept what the Taoiseach has said, there is one thing missing.  Even though this issue was flagged and heralded many months ago, there is no degree of urgency.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The Deputy is going to have to find an alternative way to raise this issue.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	140	The need for the information is obvious to everybody.  I know that the Taoiseach means what he says to the House.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The Deputy has made his point.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I have given the Deputy a lot of latitude on this matter.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The Ceann Comhairle will be glad to know that I am finishing with my latitude now.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	145	If he wants to pursue it, he can do so on the Adjournment or in several other ways.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I merely wanted to ask the Taoiseach again if he will give particular or specific instructions to those involved in preparing the Bill to complete their endeavours as a matter of urgency.  Will he do that?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The process is under way, as I have said.  The question of whether these matters should be dealt with constitutionally or legislatively was referred to the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, which is chaired by Deputy O'Rourke.  The legislative route has been taken and progress has been made.  All I can do is reiterate what has been said about this legislation on a number of occasions in the past week, both inside and outside the House.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The Garda Síochána is operating within the strictures of cutbacks.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I am coming to it.  In some cases, criminals are better equipped with modern technology than the Garda itself.  When will the Garda Síochána (amendment) Bill, which will provide for amendments to existing legislation that have been sought by the force, be published?  This important legislation, which has been on the clár for a long time, should be brought forward as soon as possible.  If it is not possible to do that before Christmas, it should be done early in the new year.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I understand that while the heads of the Bill have almost been finalised, there is no date for its introduction.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	154	When does the Government plan to publish the mental capacity Bill?  I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform originally said it would be published last Easter, but we are still awaiting its publication.  This legislation is important because it will protect the most vulnerable people in our society.  It is essential because it will update extremely archaic legislation that dates back to 1871.  The 1871 Act urgently needs to be updated so that we can fulfil our obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I understand it is hoped to bring that legislation forward early in the new year.

The education (patronage) Bill has been promised for a long time.  As it is a very small Bill, I cannot understand why it has not been published.  Second, there is deep unease in American circles about the continued failure of the Department of Education and Science to meet the commitments that have been made in our name to honour Mr. George Mitchell.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House whether the commitments that have been made by Ireland will be honoured before Christmas?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I understand that the Bills in question, which are due for publication at the start of the next session, will be published at that time.

I am not sure whether it is before the Seanad at present.  The Bill in question will amend the Child Care Act 1991.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	160	Did the Deputy say that the Bill is in the Seanad?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I am not sure if it is in the Seanad.  It may have been published with the intention of being introduced in the Seanad, but that may not have happened yet.  The Murphy report said that the powers of the HSE are not adequate to deal with child sexual abuse by non-family members and suggested specifically that the 1991 Act needs to be amended to address this issue.  When it deals with the Bill that is already published, will the Government take the opportunity to address the giving of extra powers to the HSE with regard to child sexual abuse by non-family members?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The line Minister would be much more appropriate.

It concerns legislation.  I merely asked the Taoiseach when legislation is promised to address a matter on which the Supreme Court decided Ireland was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, a convention that has been incorporated into our legislation.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Legislation has been promised in this area but, as the Deputy said——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	170	A question to the line Minister would be the best way of dealing with it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I call Deputy Seymour Crawford.  Deputy Costello has had a good innings on this.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	172	It is part of the new programme for Government so surely the Taoiseach should know something about it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	173	Is it promised legislation.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	174	It clearly is promised legislation so I believe I am entitled to expect an answer.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	175	It can be dealt with by an Adjournment matter or a parliamentary question.  There are many other ways.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	176	Perhaps it was a Green Party proposal.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	177	As Standing Orders stand at present, on the Order of Business Deputies are entitled to ask about matters that are in the programme for Government and about promised legislation.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I am allowing very considerable latitude on these matters.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Questions must concern promised legislation and this legislation does not appear to be promised.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	181	We do not need the Ceann Comhairle's latitude.  We just want him to enforce the rules.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I simply wish to get an answer.  If something was put into the programme for Government two months ago, surely there must be some indication of when the legislation will come before this House.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	183	The matter will be taken forward by the relevant Minister now that it is in the programme.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Who is that?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	185	It is usually the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	187	In light of the ongoing difficulties in the housing market and the fact that many people are going into situations where they may rent rather than own their houses, when will the landowner and tenants Bill be brought forward so that the issue may be discussed?  Prices cannot now be lowered for tenants and that is not suitable for businesses.The ongoing situation is that people are under tremendous pressure with regard to their incomes and obviously the budget will create more pressure.  Will the Taoiseach ensure the inclusion of judges in this situation?  Will he also ensure that the legal costs Bill promised in this House years ago will be brought forward in order to control the extraordinary costs that are being paid to barristers and others through tribunal mechanisms and others?  It is long past time that was brought to heel.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Both those pieces of legislation are due next year.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	189	For the Taoiseach's information, I preface my question by saying that people have come to me reporting that their credit unions were letting them down with regard to financial difficulties——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	190	That is not really appropriate for the Order of Business.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	191	It is very much so.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	192	It concerns promised legislation.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Section 35(12) (a) of the Credit Unions Act 1977 has inhibited——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	194	That is not promised legislation.  It was passed in 1977, some time ago.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I ask the Ceann Comhairle to bear with me.  The section has inhibited credit unions from extending the term of a loan from five years.  In April, the Minister for Finance promised——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I ask the Deputy to table a parliamentary question on the matter to the Minister for Finance.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I am sorry, but in April this year the Minister for Finance promised he would look at section 35(12) (a) of the Credit Unions Act.  As it stands now, credit unions cannot extend loans and are driving people to illegal and unlicensed money lenders.  I do not believe this is where we want people to go three weeks before Christmas.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	198	Please table a parliamentary question, Deputy.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	199	This concerns promised legislation.  The Minister for Finance promised it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	200	There is no promised legislation here.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The Minister for Finance promised it in April.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	202	At the annual general meeting.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	203	According to the Deputy, the Minister for Finance said he would look at the situation.  I am not sure that constitutes a promise to amend the legislation but I will take up the matter and get back to the Deputy.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I thank the Taoiseach.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I have three brief questions.  First, we dealt with Second Stage of the Merchant Shipping Bill.  When will it reappear?  Second, regarding the threat to 3,500 jobs in Aer Lingus, when will the Minister for Transport answer questions in the House?  The Ceann Comhairle facilitated a short debate on the matter last week but the Minister was missing.  The Minister who turned up did not have a clue about the issue.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	206	We cannot revisit this now.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	207	The Minister for Transport is present now.  There is a major crisis and he has nothing to say.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	208	The opportunity still exists, as last week.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I have a third question.  Is it intended to introduce legislation to change the regulations governing jobs initiatives and community employment?  As the Taoiseach will know, in all our community development areas people are frantic about what they believe is a major threat to their jobs, training and access to training.  All the local services such as youth work, senior care, meals on wheels and so on will be affected by the measures the Taoiseach's Government apparently will bring forward next Wednesday.  Can the Taoiseach calm the fears of the community sector?  I believe he is familiar with it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	210	One way to calm fears is not to speculate on an issue, as the Deputy did by suggesting what he did.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The Taoiseach's officials told them this.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The Merchant Shipping Bill is awaiting Committee Stage.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I have questions about two items of legislation.  The first is the Multi-unit Developments Bill which will be of considerable interest to people in my constituency who are affected by management companies, as I am.  It is particularly relevant after the loss of a roof from an apartment building in south Dublin.  That Bill has been published.  Will it come to the Dáil before Christmas or during the next session?  When can we anticipate that Bill being discussed in the Chamber?Second, legislation has been promised concerning competition and consumer protection that would merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority and make some changes to section 4 of the Consumer Protection Act to allow certain professionals such as general practitioners and pharmacists negotiate with the Government for their services.  I understand that Bill has been held up because of disagreements between the two agencies involved.  May we have an assurance the Bill will be published in the new year, or when will its heads be agreed?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	214	The heads of that Bill are being worked on at present.  It will be some time next year before all the issues are resolved.  Regarding the other matter, which was queried before in the House, I understand the Bill is on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  Amendments are being worked upon.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	215	When does the Taoiseach expect the Control of Dogs Act to be enacted?  Is it likely to be in this session?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I understand that matter will be before the Cabinet soon
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	217	Regarding legislation for the protection of children, we must start doing something very practical.  We all agree that parents, or those in charge of children, cannot be with them 24 hours a day and therefore things happen.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	218	Does this concern legislation?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Concerning such legislation and a referendum in respect of children, will the Taoiseach consider putting in place an advertising campaign, such as those that featured measles, swine flu and other such matters?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	220	That is not promised legislation.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	221	We must start moving forward with regard to protecting our children.  Such a campaign should be about allowing children to have information by which they would be able to protect themselves.  I ask——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	222	There are several ways of approaching the line Minister on this matter.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Might it be inserted into legislation as it is being worked on?  Every right-minded person——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Is there promised legislation in this area?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	225	——thinks we should move on and ensure our children can be protected——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I am sure a parliamentary question would elicit the information.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	227	——better than they are at present.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I can only refer to recent statements by the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, on this matter, which concerns all the various recommendations he is working on arising from the Ryan report.  It is important to have effective public information and access thereto.  The Children First guidelines set out many of these issues.  The Minister of State has indicated his intention to put them on a statutory basis ultimately.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	229	With regard to the arrangements for the budget, bearing in mind that there is to be a social welfare Bill, it has been the custom on the afternoon of recent Budget Statements and in the following days and week for Ministers to hold ministerial press conferences to outline the impact of the Estimates on their Departments.  Since we only get the Estimates when the Minister rises to his feet to deliver the Budget Statement——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	230	This is not an appropriate time to make that point.  There are other ways of raising it.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	231	——what arrangements will the Taoiseach make for the Opposition to obtain information on how the Estimates will operate?  Will Ministers run press conferences at the same time as the budget and social welfare Bill are being debated in the House?  We have no way of getting the information except through the ministerial press conferences.Given that the budget is a week later than usual and so close to Christmas, how will information on the Estimates and the programme for each Department be made available?  Has the Government discussed this?  We receive the Estimates only after the Minister has risen to make the budget speech.  They comprise an appendix to the budget.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I am sure no one will mind the Government seeking to represent to the public the factual position on decisions it has taken.  That is normal procedure and I am sure the Opposition will have views on the matter also.  It is a question of the Minister for Finance bringing forward his budget.  The documentation will be circulated in the normal way and a debate will ensue.  Ministers and many other Members will have points to make on it.  We will simply be representing our position.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	233	This is important.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	234	It is important, I agree.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Last year, we received information on the withdrawal of the medical card for people over 70 only through the ministerial press conference and information from the HSE.  Similarly, we only received information about the schools capital investment programme several days after the budget.  Given that the timeframe is now so short, is the Government willing to make the relevant information available?  In the past, when Ministers were making announcements——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Why does the Deputy not bring this up with the Minister for Finance?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	237	——about spending moneys, they were happy to hold press conferences.  What will they do this year when it is likely that circumstances will be more curtailed?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The Deputy should raise the matter with the Minister for Finance in order to obtain the information.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	239	No, the Taoiseach is the leader of the Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	240	The position will be the same as every other year.  If the Minister for Finance were to stand up in the House and announce every aspect of the Estimates, in addition to making a budgetary statement, he would be here for many hours.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I agree——
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	242	The Minister should make a written submission.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The complaint from the Opposition would then be that the Minister was not allowing a debate to take place.  The issue is that the Minister for Finance will outline the budget and refer to the various documents that will be provided to people.  Ministers, in line with their responsibility, will convey the situation as it applies to them.  A democratic debate will ensue both inside and outside the House.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Sorry, but they do it by press conference.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I cannot do any more for the Deputy than that.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	246	With regard to the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is ordered for tomorrow, I understand there was no agreement among the Whips that there should be a closure of that debate on Second Stage or that all Stages should be taken tomorrow in the House.  The communication on the Bill states the Department wishes all Stages to be taken in the House in plenary session and that the Bill will not be referred to the appropriate committee, the Select Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I will not delay the House other than to give notice that this is a very serious issue because what is proposed in the legislation affects five foreshore Acts, the Harbours (Amendment) Act and the ports legislation.  Most important——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	247	The Deputy should raise that on the Order of Business on the appropriate day.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	248	The issue concerns promised legislation and its appropriate treatment in the House.  The issues that arise are issues of State property.  They concern the foreshore of the State, which extends seawards for 12 nautical miles.  The arrangements, as circulated——

I will explain as I move to the specific sections of the Bill the urgency attaching to them.  This is the second Bill this Government has introduced this year to amend the Companies Act.  Like its predecessor, the Companies (Amendment) Act 2009, this Bill focuses on making a small number of timely, focused changes to company law.  These amendments are required immediately so that company law remains dynamic and responsive to emerging opportunities and challenges.As Deputies will be aware, work on drafting the consolidation Bill, which will incorporate all existing 14 Companies Acts into a single text, is currently under way.  I expect to publish that Bill, which will have some 1,300 sections, in September 2010.  The provisions of the Bill we are debating today will be incorporated into the consolidated Bill.The measures in today's Bill can be summarised under four headings.  First, it will allow for the use of US generally accepted accounting principles, known as US GAAP, in the preparation of the accounts of a specified category of companies.  It will also give the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the power to prescribe other internationally recognised accounting standards should this become appropriate in the future.  The second measure will allow the Minister to make regulations recognising stock exchanges outside the State for a specified purpose.  Third, the Bill will limit the potential exposure of the Exchequer to costs that could arise from court appointed inspectors carrying out investigations into the affairs of a company.  Fourth, the Bill will ensure continuity of membership by directors of committees of inquiry established by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.The Companies Acts should respond swiftly and appropriately to emerging opportunities.  To meet this goal, I am currently finalising another significant company law proposal which is at an advanced stage.  I hope it will be brought to a point where it is ready for inclusion in this Bill and I therefore wish to advise Deputies that I intend to seek the permission of the House to include it by way of Committee Stage amendment.On the first of the Bill's provisions, which I will refer to as the US GAAP proposal, I wish to make some introductory comments.  Attracting and developing foreign direct investment in the State is a major strand of the policy of this Government.  Foreign direct investment has played a pivotal role in Ireland's economic growth over the past decades and will continue to do so into the future.  The nature of the investments we have attracted has changed significantly over the years.  While in the past, we were a location that concentrated primarily on manufacturing, we have become a centre for educated young Europeans.  Ireland now plays a key role in the smart economy, which is built on the dual strengths of our innovativeness and entrepreneurship. The appointment last week of Ms Maire Geoghegan Quinn as European Commissioner for Research and Innovation clearly demonstrates that Ireland's commitment to the innovation agenda is well-recognised internationally.I offer my best wishes to future Commissioner Ms Geoghegan Quinn.  We look forward to the role she will play in promoting research and innovation, which is a key component of the Irish strategy and of the Lisbon agenda in the context of job creation and making sure we move Europe forward in terms of investment in research and development, innovation, commercialisation and other such areas.Ireland's readiness to adapt and respond to changing circumstances has contributed significantly to the fact that, notwithstanding the economic downturn, we continue to be an attractive location for foreign direct investment.  To date the IDA has made 48 announcements, with a combined investment in excess of €650 million and a potential to create 3,300 jobs.  It is encouraging that so many companies are prepared to undertake and announce these investments in Ireland given the current global economic environment.  The more optimistic economic forecasts for 2010, globally and for Ireland, should help the IDA to make a significant contribution to economic recovery and continue to secure foreign direct investment for Ireland.However, to attract investors, industrial promotion policy needs to be agile, flexible, imaginative and continuously evolving.  This is particularly the case where the attraction, integration and retention of foreign investment projects in Ireland are concerned.  This is paramount at times like now where the global economy is facing almost unprecedented challenges and where there is intense competition for a restricted pool of foreign direct investment.  In times like these foreign investments do not come easily and there is intense competition, so we should try to remove as many obstacles as possible while at the same time making sure our integrity is protected.Multinational companies also face challenges as they seek to adjust and adapt to a changed and changing economic situation worldwide.  Those who wish to survive, not to mention prosper, simply cannot afford to stand still.  For many, this means restructuring and reconfiguring their global operations to the best advantage.  Such strategies have the potential to result in opportunities or disadvantages for investment locations around the world.  This is the challenge facing Ireland.  It is possible that in the context of the reconfiguration of multinationals globally we may be the beneficiary of such moves or the companies concerned may move elsewhere.  That is something of which we have to be conscious.  The pool is currently shrinking.  Multinationals are experiencing difficulties.  They are realigning all their operational bases, and consolidation and takeovers are taking place.  We have to be responsive to their needs.Ireland does not have the luxury of passively watching as multinational investment disappears to competitive destinations which have kept up with or anticipated new trends and developments.  We cannot afford to miss out on these possibilities if we are to work our way through our current economic difficulties.  The Government is aware that openings must be created and availed of and it is committed to doing all that is possible to meet this goal.The US GAAP proposal is the broad policy context in which the US GAAP measure, contained in the Bill before us today, can be seen.  The Bill is designed to facilitate multinational companies which have operations in Ireland to continue to add activities and substance to such operations.  This will further contribute to economic activity here and provide valuable employment opportunities.  This measure will assist in attracting specific categories of companies from abroad to establish in the State.  Certain multinational companies, which already have a substantial investment presence in Ireland, have further integrated their activities here by transferring their parent undertakings to Ireland.  As these companies are listed on US stock exchanges and report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, they will continue to have to prepare US accounts using US accounting standards to remain compliant in the United States.In addition to this obligation, as Irish registered companies, these multinational parent undertakings also have to prepare Irish accounts.  The accounting standards followed by most companies in this State are Irish generally accepted accounting practices,  known as Irish GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, known by the acronym IFRS and which were adopted by the EU.  It would be particularly onerous and expensive for a company if the obligation to convert to Irish GAAP or EU IFRS were to arise over a compressed period, and inordinately so, if this requirement arose during a company's current financial year.  This is the prime reason for the urgency of this Bill, so I would appreciate the co-operation of both sides of the House to pass it.  It is based on the need to address the accounting year for 2009.  The companies concerned need to have formal confirmation as soon as possible of the nature of their reporting requirements in Ireland for the current year.The legislation I am now introducing provides for the use by this restricted category of companies of US GAAP for a limited period.  The arrangement will apply for a maximum of four financial years and will expire on 31 December 2015 at the latest.  This measure will facilitate an orderly transition by these companies to the use of Irish GAAP or IFRS.  There is a precedent for this.  When IFRS was introduced by the EU, a transitional period was allowed so that the various parties could make the necessary preparations.Another point I make is that companies will be subject to Irish company law generally, including all the provisions which relate to accounts.  My objective is that Irish company law will override any provision of US GAAP if it conflicted with the Companies Acts.Allowing these companies to prepare their Irish accounts using US accounting standards for a limited period would eliminate the significant duplication of cost and effort of preparing two sets of accounts under two different sets of accounting standards.  It will also create a bridge roughly spanning the period during which significant international developments are expected regarding the convergence of US and international accounting standards.  In the interests of providing for future flexibility in this area, I am including an enabling provision for ministerial prescription of other specified internationally recognised accounting standards if such a demand arose and it was considered appropriate to do so.  Any such regulations will apply for the same transitional period as the US GAAP measure.The second measure in the Bill is one I introduced by way of Committee Stage amendment in the Seanad.  It is designed to allow Irish registered companies which are listed on foreign stock exchanges to exercise a right to buy back their own shares on that exchange on a similar basis to that permitted when they buy back their own shares through a stock exchange operating in this State.  It will also facilitate international groups relocating their parent undertaking to Ireland but who are not listed on the Irish stock exchange and that wish to make market purchases of their own shares.  This will result in significant internal administrative simplification for those companies.To briefly outline the impact of this measure, at present the Irish stock exchange is the only exchange recognised for market purchase of own shares.  Market purchases must be authorised by the company at a general meeting and this authorisation is sufficient for all contracts for purchase of own shares for the period of the authorisation, which is usually 18 months.  For the purchase of own shares on stock exchanges that are not recognised, the terms of each individual contract for purchase of the shares must be authorised in advance by a special resolution of the company.  The measure included in today's Bill will enable the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make regulations recognising stock exchanges outside the State for a new type of purchase called an "overseas market purchase".  An overseas market purchase is similar to a market purchase but with a new obligation on the company to publicise its purchase of own shares on the company website for the purposes of informing the market.The third measure in the Bill addresses a potential exposure of the Exchequer to costs of inspectors appointed by the High Court under section 7 of the Companies Act 1990.  That Act contains two related powers which allow the court to appoint inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company.  Section 8 facilitates such an appointment at the request of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, while section 7 provides that a variety of specified interested parties can petition the High Court to have inspectors appointed.  Those parties include the company itself, a director of the company, a creditor and a group or block of shareholders of the company.As the law stands at present, there is an upper limit of €317,435 on the amount that those who petition for such an appointment can be required to pay towards these costs.  This limit applies both to the security they can be asked to advance before the investigation commences and to the amount of the eventual costs of the investigation that the applicants would be required to bear.  Unless the court decides that a company should meet all or some of the costs of the investigation, the balance of those costs, namely the amount above the applicants' statutory ceiling of just over €317,000, would need to be borne by the State.  On the basis of previous experience, the cost of a wide-ranging investigation could amount to €10 million.It is necessary to take immediate action to protect the taxpayer from having to meet the very significant costs of such investigations, some of which could conceivably duplicate investigations happening elsewhere in the State system, for example by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Financial Regulator or the Criminal Assets Bureau.  This requirement needs to be balanced with the competing duty of the State to ensure shareholders and others have suitable access to justice.  To ensure an optimum balance would be achieved I considered a number of alternative policy responses to this question.  Having regard to wider safeguards provided for in company law that are available to prospective applicants under section 7, I have concluded that the fairest and most balanced way of approaching this issue is to remove the absolute limit on costs currently applicable to applicants.This will leave total discretion to the court on the issue of costs and will place applicants under this provision on the same general footing as other parties initiating court proceedings in that they can be held liable for the full costs if the court so decides.  The costs of investigations initiated by the ODCE, under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990, would continue to be met in the first instance by the Exchequer through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's Vote.The final measure in the Bill was also introduced on Committee Stage in the Seanad, which proves the usefulness of the Seanad.  It provides for continuity of membership by directors of committees of inquiry established by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA.  This measure addresses the problem that arose regarding one of the current directors of IAASA whose term of office was due to expire in January 2010.  That director was a member of a committee of inquiry by virtue of being a director.  Therefore if the work of the committee continued beyond January 2010 the director would no longer have entitlement to his place on the committee.  This would cause the make-up of the committee to change during the inquiry, which could raise questions of due process and fair procedures, and might leave the process open to challenge by way of judicial review.The measure I have included in the Bill therefore provides that a person who is a director at the time of the formation of such a committee will be entitled to continue on that committee until the inquiry is completed.  The amendment will also provide that inquiries already ongoing will not be affected by the proposed changes in the Bill.  The amendment will also ensure that staff of IAASA can make preliminary inquiries into matters that come to the attention of IAASA before deciding whether such matters should be submitted to the board for full inquiry.I shall now outline the details of the Bill.  Section 1 provides that a true and fair view of a parent undertaking may be given by the use of US GAAP by certain parent undertakings.  These relevant undertakings are tightly defined in the section.  This is subject to the proviso that the use of those principles in the preparation of the undertaking's accounts does not contravene any of the provisions of the Companies Acts or any regulations made under those Acts.  The accounts in question are the company's group accounts and the individual accounts of the parent company.  This arrangement will be limited to a specified category of companies.  These are defined as parent companies incorporating in Ireland for the first time whose securities are not traded on a regulated market in the European Economic Area, whose securities are registered with or which are subject to reporting to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and which, on the date that this Bill passes into law, have not already incurred an obligation to file their first accounts with the Companies Registration Office.The section also provides for this arrangement to apply in respect of a relevant undertaking for a maximum of four financial years and it expires on 31 December 2015 at the latest.  Where accounts are prepared under this section, the notes to the accounts are required to state that this is the case.Section 2 gives the Minister the power to make regulations that may prescribe other specified internationally recognised accounting standards under which specified categories of companies may prepare accounts for a maximum of four financial years or to end by 31 December 2015.  Any such regulations shall specify the accounting standards, which shall be internationally recognised, and generally accepted accounting principles or practices of a jurisdiction where a majority of the subsidiaries of the parent undertaking have a substantial connection or where the market is situated on which the shares of the parent undertaking are primarily admitted to trading.  In preparing accounts using other internationally recognised accounting standards, companies must not contravene any provision of the Companies Acts or any regulations made under these Acts.  Where accounts are prepared under this section, the notes to the accounts are required to state that this is the case.Section 3 makes a number of amendments to the Companies Act 1990 to facilitate two of the measures already mentioned which are contained in this Bill.  All but two of the amendments in this section relate to the recognition of stock exchanges outside the State.  This has required some technical amendments such as to the definition of a "recognised stock exchange".  The new concept of an overseas market purchase that I referred to earlier is contained in this section, as is the requirement to publish particulars of the purchase of its own shares on the company website for the purposes of informing the market.In addition to these amendments section 3 also removes the current upper limits that applicants can be asked to contribute towards the costs of court investigations initiated on foot of their applications under section 7 of the Companies Act 1990.  This amendment involves removing the statutory limit in the two sections of the 1990 Act where it appears — section 7 dealing with security for costs and section 13 which deals with the final costs of the completed investigation.Section 4 amends the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 to provide for the continuity of committees of inquiry of IAASA and for staff to make preliminary assessments of matters that come to the attention of IAASA without the need for immediate reference to the board of directors.Section 5 is standard drafting and simply contains the short title and the fact that the Act and the Companies Acts shall be read as one.The measures in the Bill are evidence of the Government's commitment to ensuring that company law remains responsive to any emerging challenges and opportunities.  I commend the Bill to the House.The consolidation of the 14 Companies Acts is at an advanced stage.  It is major undertaking.  This legislation and the previous one the House passed will be incorporated into the consolidated companies Bill when it is published.

There are also additional Seanad amendments to which I will need to give more attention at a later Stage.  When reviewing the Bill we need to consider three things.  First, we need to consider the potential gain for Ireland in jobs and investment.  The second matter is the potential reputational risks that may derive from the Bill and the third is the appropriateness of section 2 and whether we should give the Minister powers of this nature to recognise other accounting systems without being required to come back to this Parliament.As the House will be aware, EU regulations currently require that companies use the international financial reporting system or continue to use Irish GAAP.  A convergence of accounting standards is currently taking place and I do not know when it will be concluded.  In view of this, it is probably appropriate to allow a transition period for companies that are moving their parent undertakings here.Implementation of this legislation would appear to involve genuine economic gains for Ireland in terms of jobs, investment and, potentially, revenue, provided the operations involved are real and not just brass-plate operations.  It also helps to underline the pro-business nature of our country and the fact that we are open to foreign direct investment.  However, I would be interested to know one or two things.  Is any reciprocation being offered to Irish companies that may for whatever reason decide to have their parent undertakings in the United States?  Will such companies be allowed to use Irish GAAP or IRFS?  Has that situation arisen?Part of the justification for this legislation is that companies would face a significant cost in making the transition from US GAAP to IFRS over such a short period.  It has been suggested by one company that it would cost it €20 million to do so.  I find that hard to believe, and I ask the Minister of State to outline at a later stage the estimated administrative cost to companies if this legislation were not brought in.  The figure of €20 million was mentioned in the regulatory impact analysis for this Bill.  What is not explained in the RIA is whether the additional cost is entirely an administrative one.  Given the complications of moving from one system of accounting to the other, is this the case?  Are there other benefits for companies in this?  For example, can they declare their assets or pay their taxes in a different way?I read the detailed table showing the difference between US GAAP and IFRS.  Not being an accountant, it was difficult for me to understand, but there seemed to be many differences in the way companies do their books under each system.  How does that affect the potential benefits for these companies?  Will they be in a position to pay less tax than they would if the Bill was not introduced?  Will they be able to value their assets in a different way — for example, based on capital depreciation of equipment?  What is the potential impact on the State in terms of lost revenue, if any, given that the four companies mentioned are here already?We must have some regard to the potential reputational issues arising from this legislation.  We often talk about the five-part crisis: the budgetary crisis, with which the Government is obsessed; the banking crisis, with which it is also obsessed; the jobs and competitiveness crisis, which it does not care about; and the social and reputational crises.  Ireland's reputation has taken a real hit because of the failure of our political system, our Civil Service, our banks and our public institutions.  As a result, Ireland has gone from being a good word to a bad word internationally, which is costing us in terms of investment and jobs.  It is also costing our exporters by making it harder for them to export overseas, and the Government by raising the cost of borrowing.We have a duty over the next couple of years to restore the reputation of Ireland.  If there is any possibility that this legislation may result in damage to our reputation or cause us to be perceived as the Bermuda of Europe, the Wild West or Liechtenstein on the Liffey, as we have been described by the Financial Times for other reasons, we must take this very seriously.  The RIA states that the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the IDA do not believe there are any reputational risks in this legislation and I suppose I must take that on trust.  However, I have concerns about potential damage to our reputation from the Government’s bending over backwards to facilitate a small number of companies which are moving their headquarters from Bermuda — a tax haven that is now being squeezed by President Obama — to what I hope is not a new tax haven in the west of Europe.I refer to section 1(1)(a).  The explanatory memorandum states: “These are parent companies incorporating in Ireland for the first time whose securities are not traded on a regulated market in the EEA, whose securities are registered with or who are subject to reporting to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)”, while the Bill itself states:"relevant parent undertaking" means a parent undertaking—(a) which does not have securities admitted to trading on a regulated market,but does not specifically mention the EEA.  Is there a reason for this?I have serious problems with section 2.  I will need to confer with my colleagues on this but I do not think we as a party can stand over this section, which would essentially allow the Minister to recognise accounting systems other than US GAAP by order.  I do not know what types of accounting system are out there in the world, but I am not sure whether I trust this Government — or any Government — to have the power to decide, by order, suddenly to recognise Zimbabwe GAAP, Iceland GAAP or Serbia GAAP.  If it was appropriate for the Minister of State to come to this Parliament with primary legislation to recognise US GAAP, it would be equally appropriate for him to come here again with primary legislation, if he feels it necessary, to recognise accounting systems of fourth and fifth countries and explain to the House — that is, the representatives of the people — why he thinks that should be done.I also have some concerns about regulation and monitoring.  Is it the view of the Minister that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement are fully competent and resourced to regulate, manage and oversee three different systems of accounting — namely, Irish GAAP, IFRS and US GAAP — or will we be relying on the SEC?  Will we be effectively outsourcing oversight to a foreign country?The Minister commented on the usefulness of the Seanad.  As Members know, it is my party's proposal to have a referendum on the future of the Seanad.  The Seanad in its current form is not capable of being reformed and should be abolished.  That is not to say I do not see the case, in some countries, for having an Upper House, but our Seanad is not an Upper House.  What happens in a proper parliament — which, under this Constitution and Government, we unfortunately do not have — is that legislation is brought in to the lower house and discussed and amended, after which the upper house reviews and reconsiders the legislation.  It should be made up of people who are not ordinary politicians and who are not directly elected but have a particular expertise or sectoral experience.  The practice of introducing Bills into the Seanad and amending them before they are discussed in the Dáil undermines it.  If we are to have a Seanad at all it should be an upper house; legislation should be introduced and amended in the Dáil and should then go to the Seanad for a fresh look.  If we are to continue to have an upper house that is the kind of role it should have.  I would welcome some clarification on the matters I have mentioned.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	295	On behalf of the Labour Party I confirm our acceptance of the need for this legislation, subject to a number of caveats, some of which have been referred to and elucidated by Deputy Varadkar.This is the second Bill brought before the House with some degree of urgency; we have also had to deal with the Companies (Amendment) Act 2009.  Dr. Thomas Courtney will have a busy time in the not too distant future bringing forward a new edition of his book, which I purchased after the last time when I had some other book on which I was relying.  Dr. Courtney's book is an excellent tome and probably the definitive guide on company law.We should seek outside expertise like Dr. Courtney to help in the oversight of the new consolidated Bill which, as Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, stated, will incorporate the 14 pieces of company legislation.  We should not be afraid to engage somebody of that expertise.  The Minister of State is correct.  It is an arduous task, trying to fit it all into one composite Bill and make it a coherent and understandable corpus of legislation.  We should ensure that it is clear, not just for lawyers but for the ordinary persons and the shareholders and directors for whom greater fiduciary duties and obligations are now being set out.We are getting to the stage where many will not want to become directors of companies because some of the obligations now being imposed upon them are arduous and significant.  We all want to ensure good corporate governance, etc., and that people are fully aware of their obligations and duties.  One of the best ways of doing so is that people taking on those onerous roles would be fully equipped and educated.  It is no longer good enough for a person to just arrive into a company as a director, even one of the smallest ones, because these are now tasks which carry criminal sanctions if they do not comply.  It is important that they are properly educated, and courses should be run.  More fundamentally, directors should be aware.I agree with the Minister of State that rushing the forthcoming piece of legislation would be foolhardy.  We might as well take our time and get it right.  It is important in this context that it be understandable for the ordinary person and that it contains linkage.There are a number of points I want to make on this and there are a number of caveats which the Labour Party would attach to some degree to the legislation.  I wonder why, when it has been introduced in the Seanad, the Minister had to make further amendments.  I understood that this would be just a two-section Bill.  It started off like that.  I accept there are other parts of sections included which are normal company law issues, but it makes it a little more difficult for us to deal with some of the issues that arise.  There are now a number of different and unrelated issues in the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 being put forward.The first element of the legislation deals with companies based in America, in particular, the application of the US generally accepted accounting principles, US GAAP.  This will allow companies which relocate their parent or head office companies to Ireland to continue for a specified defined period of time to draw up their group accounts and individual parent company accounts using the relevant accounting standards that govern their operation in the USA, and which is clearly required, I suppose, in the context of the requirements of the listing of US companies.  However, I understand from the Minister of State today that these transitional arrangements will terminate at the end of December 2015.  The specific derogation for US companies for the period means they will now be in a position to comply with the company law standards and provisions that apply in their home country as opposed to having to comply with Irish or, indeed, international financial reporting standards.  It is clear that this amendment will now necessitate some other amendments being made to the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003.  One anticipates that the thrust of this amendment is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place for inward investment originating in the USA and that any obstacle, either real or perceived, is removed in this context and as a result of this legislation.I agree with the Minister of State that the work of IDA Ireland in this context is extremely important in ensuring continued foreign direct investment, which is an important component of Irish economic growth.  We must salute IDA Ireland's ongoing efforts in terms of its powerful role of attracting foreign investment.  However, I must use this opportunity somewhat regretfully to convey once again my extreme disappointment at the failure of IDA Ireland to attract a major, influential and core industry in the high-tech, health care or financial management areas to the excellently located and well-appointed IDA industrial park in Marlinstown in Mullingar.  The site encompasses 70 acres, 27 acres of which have planning permission and on which there are buildings located, and includes roadways and infrastructure.  It is well-located beside the N4, the N52 and Mullingar, with the N6 only a few miles up the road.  From a road infrastructural viewpoint, it is excellently serviced.  We have excellent educational facilities.  Secondary schools include the Christian Brothers, Mullingar Community College, St. Finian's College, Wilson's Hospital which is only out the road, Killucan community college and Castlepollard Community College.  There also are the secondary schools in Rocheford Bridge and Kilbeggan.  Athlone Institute of Technology, one of the best institutes of technology in the country, with Professor Ó Catháin at its head, is only 25 miles away.I have conveyed my disappointed directly to Mr. Barry O'Leary and Mr. Kevin McCarthy who are trying to do their best.  We now have a good stock of housing, keenly and competitively priced, and a well-educated and ready-to-work workforce.  We have everything in place, yet we seem to have been bypassed in the attraction of employment.  We have not been successful over the past number of years and it is a source of great disappointment to the entire community in Mullingar, from the education sector to the chamber of commerce, the trade union sector and the local authorities.  Westmeath County Council played a pivotal role in ensuring that Marlinstown was up and running.  It took all steps, and worked hand in glove with IDA Ireland, to accelerate its development and make it such an attractive place, and yet we have been bypassed.I reiterate my call to the Minister of State, who is responsible for this area with IDA Ireland, to ensure that IDA Ireland focuses on Mullingar as an area which is entitled to its fair share of inward investment.  Particularly given the efforts of the local people and the efforts of the local authorities and the State agencies involved, its time has now come.  We are in the whirlwind of an economic recession and we need FDI more than ever.  Mullingar has waited and has been bypassed, and it will no longer accept being second class in terms of not getting its fair share of IDA Ireland activity.I accept that IDA Ireland executives are doing their best, but I call upon them today to redouble their efforts in this regard.  If nothing happens in 2010, it will be an ultimate failure and we will not stand for it any longer.  I am extremely disappointed with the progress to date.  I say that with regret but I must say it because I am elected to represent the people and to make such statements in this regard.The second issue on the Bill which I did not have much time to consider and to which I may need to return relates to the recognition of the stock exchanges, particularly those outside the State, for a new type of purchase called an "overseas market purchases".  It is important that the public is made fully aware of the companies' activities especially where they are purchasing their own shares.  That is a matter to which we will be paying particular attention so that information is conveyed in a very public way.  The Minister of State referred to the fact that it would be publicised on the company's website.  As somebody who may not be as sharp on such matters as others, however, I would like to see the widest level of publication so that people are made fully aware, particularly about the purchase by a company of its own shares.  There are restrictions contained with the Company Acts in this regard and they should be pronounced and elevated to a particular status in this context.On section 2, I agree with Deputy Varadkar, who stole my thunder.  The making of regulations is a matter about which I have grave reservations.  In this context, the Minister is assuming power to make regulations that may prescribe other specified internationally recognised accounting standards under which specified categories of companies may prepare accounts for a maximum of four financial years or to end by 31 December 2015.  Unless something peculiar happened in the interim, surely the Minister of State would now be aware and have those on the tip of his tongue.  He should be in a position to convey the relevant information on any such company that might be in that group.  I have already made my views known on secondary legislation, including regulations, and I do not like it.  Laying matters before the Houses in a simplistic manner is not the way to do business.  It is an extension of our powers that is not subject to appropriate debate, scrutiny, evaluation and assessment.All legislation should be subject to such oversight.  Very often legislation emerges, but a particular aspect of it may cause significant difficulty and can become problematic in some area or form.  People then wonder how such legislation reached the Statute Book, but much secondary legislation is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the form of regulations.  It derives its power from the originating legislation, but is never subject to the same degree of scrutiny as the Bill before us.  Notwithstanding that we are in favour of this Bill, we must take great care to ensure that whatever goes on the Statue Book is consistent with the legislative norms that apply, particularly in the context of company law.  As the Minister of State said earlier, there is already a significant corpus of legislation concerning the implementation of various sections that have been enacted since 1963, and subsequently amended.I wished to issue that caveat, which I have raised before concerning the Disease of Animals Acts 1996 and 2000.  Many things that were said at that time have not been honoured.  As legislators we should be slow to give any Minister the power to introduce measures through regulation.  I am not referring personally to the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher.  However, I have the deepest reservations about secondary legislation in the context of this and other Bills.The Bill before us seeks to limit the potential exposure of the Exchequer to the cost of inspectors appointed upon petition or application by various parties or bodies.  A company or its creditors could apply to the High Court pursuant to section 7 of the Companies Act 1990.  From memory, there used to be a cap of £250, which petitioners had to pay towards the cost by way of security.  That was the maximum by way of security towards the overall eventual costs that were arrived at.  The security of costs could be sought for approximately £300 at the commencement of proceedings, which is covered by another section of the Companies Act, and ultimately when costs are being determined.  These sums were fixed about 19 years ago and are now outdated.The Bill rightly restores discretion to the High Court itself, which can then make its observations.  It may decide to award all costs to the petitioner or applicant, or may decide not to award any.  In that case, a person may have to bear the costs involved, but that is only fair depending on whether the application is successful.I note that the Office of Corporate Enforcement is protected under section 8.  That office is judicious and does not embark on its investigations without a preliminary sorting of them.  It is correct in that regard.  Some people want everything to be investigated, but the Director of Corporate  Enforcement uses his resources well in focusing and targeting the investigations.  He has done an excellent job to date in that regard.  Some of those investigations can cost millions of euro, so we must take cognisance of that.  Those issues must be examined in great detail and nobody should pursue them as a frolic.  They are always subject to great scrutiny and I salute the office for corporate enforcement for its work.  The director examines such investigations very carefully before embarking upon them.The Minister of State indicated that he will table another amendment on Committee Stage, but he did not specify its nature.  We continually respond to various maters which arise and which may not be anticipated, and we all accept that.  I generally support this Bill, subject to the caveats I have put in.  The Minister of State should furnish us with the amendment he proposes to table on Committee Stage; otherwise, we will be landed with it without warning.  It would be better to have it some days in advance so we can consider it.  Perhaps the Minister of State can indicate if he wants this Bill passed before the Christmas recess, although obviously it is also a matter for the select committee.  In the context of what my party leader said this morning, that will be a tall order considering we have only five or six working days from next week.  Committee chairpersons will take note of the fact that the committee system could become pretty strained in the coming months in trying to deal with various matters.

That tradition has helped to bring many returns to the country and it is one I am glad to follow in the few comments I wish to make on this Bill.  The word should go out from this House that we are supportive of foreign direct investment coming into the country, and continuing to come in great volumes if possible.  Having said that, the Bill gives rise to some questions that need to be posed.  We would not be doing our job as members of the Opposition if we did not allude to them.  I only heard of this Bill just over a month ago.  At the time, the draft Title given to me was the companies (transitional accounting standards) Bill.  I tabled a question about it at the time and I got a rather cryptic response from the Minister saying it was proposed to bring in the Bill to allow the use of the US generally accepted accounting principle in the preparation of accounts for a specified category of companies for a limited period of time.  That aroused my interest even further because it was a rather unusual approach.  However, the Bill is now before the House.  The Minister of State says another significant amendment is to be published, which appears to be substantive.  To a degree we are taking the Minister of State at face value, in good faith.  Such good faith might not be justified in other areas, but in this instance we have to accept to a degree the bona fides of the Government, despite the questions that exist.In the event, I can only raise a few questions.  I take it that there are specific corporations in mind.  It is probably inappropriate to ask for the names, but we must accept the Minister of State's assurance that they are either here at the moment or on their way.  I presume these are all solid institutions and as such should be welcomed.  We shall have to take the Minister of State's word in that regard.  Perhaps he might confirm that.  He might also confirm that in making this change there will not be any loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  Hopefully, it might be the reverse and result in some improvement in much-needed Exchequer resources.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	303	The Minister of State could also deal with a point raised by my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, as regards section 2.  I have some concern about having an open house in relation to institutions from other parts of the world that might, perhaps, not be as welcome as the institutions, hopefully, coming from the United States.The last issue I want to raise is, perhaps, of main concern.  We want to have foreign institutions locating here and we want to encourage them in every way that is reasonably possible.  On the other hand we do not want to assume any of the undesirable characteristics of an offshore location that is regarded as a tax haven.  That is where we would be worried.  Again, we have to take some assurances in this regard from the Minister of State.  What is the attitude of the European Commission to this Bill and what is the attitude of the US Administration towards it, and indeed, other EU member states?  Is the Government satisfied that we are embarking on an initiative that we can, in essence, stand over and be proud of?  If it is a matter of giving the IDA and other agencies another instrument in the battle for foreign direct investment, that is fine with me.  If it goes over the line, however, so that we might get an undesirable reputation abroad by going too far, I should be worried.  That is the main issue I want to raise.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State.  I accept the contents of his speech and believe the motives are right as regards trying to attract foreign business to Ireland.  Is this a common initiative across Europe, and have many other countries done it?  I accept when we were changing years ago to the IFRS system, sufficient time was given to companies.  However, have other countries implemented similar measures for specific companies?  I have not seen a list of these companies, either, but have they received guarantees that this would happen?  They assume this will be passed in the Oireachtas, or is it unfair to suggest this?Part 2 of the Bill gives the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment power to prescribe other internationally recognised accounting standards.  My understanding is that there are only two international standards, the US GAAP and the EU IFRS.  Is there something else I do not know or are there local standards to be considered, as well?  I know about the two international standards and everything else, in the event, would be "local GAAP", depending on the particular country.  Are we giving the Minister power to accept the "local GAAP" of Slovenia or some other country, or are we missing something here?  That needs to be clarified today, even while in general we are in agreement on this.  I am not aware of any other international standards but if there are the Minister of State should outline them.It is important that the Minister of State deals with this when replying to the debates.  I know of only about five areas in which there is a difference between the two accounting systems, the US GAAP and the EU IFRS.  Asset valuation is one of them.  That generally only affects paper profits, but the House needs clarification in terms of whether this has tax implications in Ireland.  I do not believe it has and that it is largely to do with presentation, but in any event, the Minister of State should clarify the position in this regard.Without knowing the companies the Minister of State has in mind, I would say that research and development costs are of major importance in this legislation.  Under US GAAP this is entitled to be written off immediately as an expense, whereas under the IFRS it can be capitalised and written off over a number of years.  That will affect profits and therefore has to affect tax.  Again, are we just talking about paper profits or will it affect the bottom line and the taxes payable to this country?I accept we want to create jobs and bring in more foreign companies, but we must also have fair play.  All companies operating in Ireland must work to the same system.  Generally, on the question of taxes, one cannot have a situation where one company will have more advantage than another.  If the legislation is to disadvantage existing Irish companies, that would be somewhat unfair.  This will affect the presentation of accounts.  Therefore when the stakeholders, whether investors, pension funds, etc., come to look at these companies relative to others operating in Ireland, there might be unfair comparisons.An unfair advantage might accrue to those companies given permission to use US accounting principles, since they will be able to present their accounts differently.  In the event, these accounts will look different to the non-educated person who wants to make a quick decision as regards investing, or who may have other reasons for looking at a company.  There are implications in all of this and it is not just a simple matter of allowing this set of procedures for four years.  The implications can have knock-on effects for everyone availing of such accounting information.  That aspect should be discussed here as well, and clarified.Who determined the four year interval, or why is that being used?  My understanding is that already there is a roadmap to converge international accounting standards under the Norfolk agreement, which provided for changes to commence in 2009, with bigger changes scheduled for 2010-11.  Is that initiative based on a four-year plan, and in the event, is that the reason why a four-year period was decided on?  Will the Minister of State clarify this because there must be some reason for it?Although we all want to see more jobs being created that does not mean we are going to accept a Bill, willy-nilly.  There is lack of information in the presentation of this Bill.  The answers to many questions could have been contained in the Minister of State's speech.  Such answers should be forthcoming at some stage before the Bill passes through the House, because they touch on important matters.  Any acceptance of somebody else's standards is very important.  As my colleague Deputy O'Keeffe has mentioned, it could impact on Ireland's reputation.  Ireland does not want to be seen as an easy mark in terms of changing standards.  Will this mean that if a company arrives here next year from South Africa or wherever, we will have to accept their accounting norms?  Are we setting ourselves up for other problems down the line?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Like my colleagues, I believe we need to welcome anything that improves the investment situation in the economy at present.  That is positive and good.  However, the introduction of legislation that is described as "urgent" worries me most of all.  If the legislation is so urgent, why was it not flagged six months ago?  There should never be an emergency in terms of legislation.  Anybody in Government, a company or any organisation that cannot anticipate legislative requirements coming down the tracks well in advance should not be in the job.  That is not a reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  Somebody down the tracks, somewhere else, should have been telling the Minister of State of this requirement long before now.If the legislation is so important, why have we not had a longer lead-in?  People have been raising the question of company law reform in this House for the last 12 months on a regular basis.  Apart from being told that the Companies Act was about to be reformed and the consolidation legislation was in train, nothing was said.  I am concerned for similar reasons to those expressed by my colleagues.  However, I want to bring one aspect in particular to the attention of the Minister of State.  This House can approve all the amendments he likes, but unless the economy becomes competitive we are wasting our time.  One phrase in the Minister of State's speech worries me concerning the fact that the nature of the investments we attract has changed significantly over the years.  While in the past Ireland concentrated primarily on manufacturing, he said, we had become a centre for what he termed "educated young Europeans".What a lovely phrase.  However, if people in Ireland think they can afford to ignore or avoid the competitiveness and cost effectiveness of the manufacturing and service sectors, they will be wasting their time.  One can play around with this point as much as one likes.  We can pretend that we are more clever than anyone else in the world or that our brains are better, sharper and greater than those of anyone else.  We can pretend the whole world will want to invest among us simply for the pleasure and privilege of being in our midst.  As the Minister of State is aware, we can forget it.  For a considerable period, Ireland has slipped down the competitiveness scale to such an extent that eventually, as a nation, we will be obliged to prostitute ourselves to encourage foreign direct investment.  This is a crazy situation and I cannot understand the reason this has not been recognised.I refer to the points that already have been raised by my colleagues.  I welcome the positive work being done by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and everyone else to create the proper environment for investment and job creation.  However, all of that will come to naught unless we can compete effectively with all other jurisdictions around us.  It is patently obvious and as plain as the nose on one's face that at present, we are not competitive.  Moreover, it does not appear as though we will become so.  Why should shoppers leave this jurisdiction en masse to shop in other jurisdictions at weekends?  This should tell us something and surely something should be done about it because all the other points are insignificant when considered in this context.I wish to discuss another matter in respect of company law.  The Acting Chairman, being a good and shrewd observer of the markets, is aware that when interest rates are low, greater investment in commodities tends to take place and this is one of those times.  When this happens, the range of commodities is varied and far-reaching and can have a greatly negative impact on an open economy such as Ireland's.  For some unknown reason, the mantra in Ireland always has been that a company director's first interest and responsibility is to the investor.  In a low-interest environment, once that principle has been established and accepted, one can forget about everything else because the company will become a bank.  It no longer will be a company providing a service in the manufacturing, services or utility sectors or whatever.  Once the principle is established that a director's first responsibility is to the investor, one then is in the business of creating a bank by another name.  All Members are aware where such thinking has led this country recently and should not need to ask for advice from anyone in this regard.As the Acting Chairman is aware, the moral of the story is that it is extremely dangerous to get into such a position because what happens is that the investor will get a dividend.  That will come first, the company will come last and eventually it will cease to exist.  Regardless of the company's original business, be it in service provision, manufacturing or whatever, it will go nowhere.  Interestingly, in the United States, in so far as I can ascertain, the first responsibility is not to the investor but to the company.  If the company becomes trashed, someone is held responsible.  However, were that to take place in Ireland, nothing would happen.  Everyone thinks it was a great deal even though the service, the company and everything else has gone.Consequently, there is an urgent need to reconsider this issue.  As the Taoiseach mentioned here a few weeks ago, Members, of whom I was one, spent 18 months studying the Companies Act 1990 on Committee Stage for their sins.  Every single issue that has arisen recently with regard to insolvency and everything else was anticipated.  However, nothing has happened.  Nothing ever happens and no action is taken.  The Government and the Oireachtas allow the show to go on as though there were no regulations, no authority and no need to comply with regulations.  That is what has happened and is what has left Ireland in its present economic position.While I will not go over the points raised by my colleagues, I emphasise the urgency of the need to make this economy competitive.  Unless our manufacturing sector is competitive, it will not make any difference what happens thereafter because other competing economies outside this jurisdiction also are competing for the smart economy and they are just as smart as are we.  The fact that Ireland has introduced emergency legislation into this House to cater for a particular situation will make no difference.  Other jurisdictions can do so as well and will do it equally quickly.  However, they will anticipate it a long time in advance.  Moreover, the same thing must be done in respect of the services sector.I note the Acting Chairman is looking askance at me.  I must be approaching the end of my allotted time and I will take a cue from that.

Before concluding however, I emphasise the great importance for our economy to recognise the need to become competitive.  We are not competitive and unless something is done soon, it will get worse.  I have tabled numerous questions to the Ministers of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance asking them to itemise and identify the issues that impede such competitiveness.  However, I have not yet been told.  The replies always are coy and cute but do not deal with the subject matter.  The Government should apply itself to this issue as a matter of extreme urgency.  I hope this proposal will be successful and will not adjust one situation at the cost of creating a worse situation.  I also hope there will be urgent recognition that we are not necessarily the smartest people on the globe.  Everyone else is just as smart and we must compete with them.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	313	To return to the legislation under consideration, Members are aware this is a transitional measure because section 2 ties it down to December 2015.  Consequently, I accept that to this degree, it is guaranteed to be transitional.  Moreover, it undoubtedly will help to consolidate and retain jobs and hopefully will create new jobs.  While all that is highly welcome, it is exceptionally important to ensure that proper accounting standards are maintained.  I share the concerns expressed by Deputy English in particular and without going over that territory again, I look forward to the Minister of State's summing up in this regard.  Some measures in the Bill, such as the publishing of share purchases, are tied down in the legislation, which is to be welcomed.  Members have witnessed how other institutions in the State conducted their business in respect of shares and the example of Anglo Irish Bank comes to mind immediately.  However, this measure is open and transparent in this regard, which I welcome greatly.A number of speakers referred to their reservations regarding the Minister's powers.  I do not refer to the Minister of State in particular but it seems to be open season for all Ministers to retain substantial power to make whatever regulations they wish, almost as they go along.  While the Minister's contribution referred to flexible and agile company law, what is needed is a flexible and agile parliament.  What is needed is an Oireachtas that can respond quickly to a Minister who wishes to introduce regulations before the Houses to have them discussed quickly in a flexible, agile and efficient manner.  Were the business of the House to be carried out in that fashion, it would be much more accountable to the people of the State.  Somewhere along the line, the Government should make up its mind to ease back on its current practice of simply giving a Minister the power to introduce almost any regulation he or she wishes.  I look forward to change in this regard.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	315	The current global economic crisis is adversely impacting on the unemployment levels across almost all advanced economies.  According to the OECD, since December 2007 there has been an increase in unemployment of 16 million people, bringing the present OECD total to almost 46 million people unemployed.It is expected there will be further increases in unemployment in the OECD in 2010, as employment growth tends to lag behind economic activity.  It is, therefore, not expected that significant employment growth will occur next year in Ireland.  The Department of Finance pre-budget outlook forecasts the unemployment rate in 2010 to average about 13.75%.However, despite these projections it is worth noting that considerable churn is still evident in the Irish labour market.  Over the past 12 months, more than 150,500 people have left the live register to take up employment.  The Department of Finance projections for next year do not include a sectoral breakdown of employment.The Government is taking specific measures to ensure job retention and job creation are maximised.  Enterprise Ireland has prepared a new recovery strategy to assist its clients.  This strategy refocuses Enterprise Ireland's efforts in strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of their client base.The enterprise stabilisation fund was launched earlier this year.  It supplies direct financial support to internationally trading enterprises that are investing in cost reduction or other measures to gain sales in overseas markets.  Client companies of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Shannon Development across all sectors in manufacturing and internationally traded services are eligible to apply.  Enterprise Ireland has approved approximately €56 million of which €50 million will be paid out this year.  To date, 140 companies have been approved to date to receive funding.The employment subsidy scheme has been introduced to support the maintenance of vulnerable jobs and prevent people from being made redundant in the challenging national and global economic environment.  The first call of the scheme will provide subsidies directly for 7,773 jobs.  In addition, firms have committed to retain a further 36,260 jobs.  This means a total of just over 44,000 jobs will be retained as a result of the first call of the scheme, at a cost of €70 million over 2009 and 2010.I have decided to have a second broader call for applications with extended eligibility criteria open to both exporting and non-exporting firms.  It will be open to many companies not eligible to apply for the first and will have a budget of €65 million.As part of a sustained, co-ordinated and integrated approach to job search, training, education and work placement supports, I have doubled the provision of training and work experience places managed by FÁS to more than 130,000.  The referral capacity of FÁS employment services from the Department of Social and Family Affairs has been increased to 147,000 persons in 2009.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe Government has, therefore, enacted a broad range of measures to support companies and individuals in these difficult economic times and we will continue to do so in the future.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for her reply.  She referred to the OECD unemployment projections and everyone accepts it will increase across the world.  What was left out of her reply was the fact that of all the OECD countries, Ireland has the second highest standardised unemployment rate.  Only Spain has a higher rate.  That is a real change and shows how much worse matters are in Ireland than in other countries.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment projected the standardised unemployment rate will reach 13.75% next year.  What will this mean in raw numbers?  How many additional net persons will be on the register?Does she believe the scale of her response is adequate?  I accept there is a stabilisation fund with €50 million and the temporary employment subsidy with €20 million and another €30 million to come and more schemes.  However, the Government was able to find €7 billion to overpay the banks.  Could the Government find at least €1 billion to support employment?Will it introduce schemes such as those proposed by Fine Gael like reducing employers' PRSI contributions, maintaining the capital budget to build more schools and invest in infrastructure to create jobs rather than pay people to have longer holidays?  Will it create internships for graduates and short-time working like they have in Germany?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The projected unemployment figure is based on averages as one cannot say what the definite figure will be.  Obviously, we would all like it to be lower than 13.75%.  It is important to note that the live register does not exclusively pertain to unemployment claimants as people on part-time assistance and other benefits are also included in it.  In this and October's live register, we have seen quite a reduction in the number of people who found themselves unemployed.There are initiatives with the stabilisation fund and the employment subsidy scheme.  We tend to forget there are large investments in the client companies of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Shannon Development.  There are also important initiatives in companies developing skills and increases in grants for research and development and the launch of innovation vouchers.  I am glad indigenous companies have moved more towards a research and development focus.There were also 70 high potential start-ups, HPSUs, this year which shows massive investment by Enterprise Ireland in new opportunities.  An hour ago, the Government launched its green technology document, based on the work of Joe Harford and the high level action group on the green economy.  It is estimated an additional 80,000 jobs can be created in this sector.  There is both sustainability and stabilisation of jobs with investment for the future.  While we never have enough money, the targets are focused.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The biggest problem is the scale of the Government's response.  I accept some action has been taken but unemployment is the largest problem facing the country.  It is the greatest social and economic crisis before it.  Unemployment benefit accounts for half the deficit and yet the additional resources the Government has put into tackling it amount to somewhere between €100 million and €150 million.  It requires a much greater response.Will the Tánaiste agree that to bring down unemployment requires the investment of €1 billion, one seventh of what her colleague overpaid the banks?  Will she agree with Fine Gael's suggestions to keep capital spending going, cut employers' PRSI, increase community employment schemes and deliver internships for graduates?  It is those kinds of measures that will make a difference.  The scale of the Tánaiste's response so far, however, has not been adequate.  Largely it has been one of corporate welfare rather than supporting the people who really need it.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I do not agree because we have done both.  Yesterday, changes were made to the job placement programme recently discussed at the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which will see more internships and work-experience placements.  That was the result of work between me and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  There has been further large scale investment in training programmes with specific emphasis on getting people back into third level to take up conversion courses.  The Government is examining other initiatives that will support people, employment and sustaining people in employment.  In the context of spending for next year, we have evaluated the quality assurance of many of our courses and have considered what new interactions may be necessary.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt what the Minister for Finance will say.  We are currently assessing specific initiatives, including short term working, some of which are operating on a pilot basis.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I propose to take questions Nos. 34 and 36 together.I take this opportunity to acknowledge the deep personal distress and loss suffered by so many people around our country as a result of the recent flooding caused by unprecedented weather conditions.  We have all seen vivid images of the impact of the floods on family homes and farms, community resources and business premises.Local action plans were implemented to address immediate emergency responses, to rescue and safeguard people and to protect to the greatest extent possible homes and premises from the affects of flooding.  These efforts are continuing.  We must acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the personnel of the various authorities and agencies, public and voluntary, communities and individuals who did outstanding work in assisting with the rescue efforts.Government focus has been on responding through the rescue efforts and in assisting those in exceptional need or experiencing hardship as a result of the flooding.  Exceptional and urgent needs payments are being paid out immediately by community welfare officers to people who need immediate basics such as food, shelter, accommodation, bedding and furniture.  The Deputy will be aware of the announcement of initial funding of €10 million for a humanitarian assistance scheme, operated through the Department of Social and Family Affairs, to facilitate individuals and families returning to their homes.  As this is a hardship fund, such assistance will be means tested.  What is being provided is not compensation but humanitarian relief for those in immediate difficulty.Flood damage has also caused difficulties for businesses in the affected areas.  While some businesses have been able to clean up and re-open others are still dealing with flooded premises and water damaged equipment and stocks.  The humanitarian assistance scheme is not intended to cover business losses.  It is primarily for the insurance sector to respond to such businesses under the terms of their commercial insurance policies.  It is not the State's role to put itself in loco the insurance industry.  Insurance companies should respond quickly to their customers’ claims and ensure that payments flow back to policyholders to facilitate early resumption of business.The banking sector too has an important role to play in supporting businesses coping with the impact of flood damage.  It is imperative that such businesses receive supportive responses from banks to requests for working capital loans and re-stocking loans and for any temporary adjustments to loan facilities already in operation.  I am glad to note that one main bank, Bank of Ireland, has already announced a number of measures to assist both personal and business customers in areas impacted by the recent floods.  The bank is asking such customers to make contact with their local branch or the bank's emergency helpline so the bank can assess the most appropriate support as quickly as possible.  Emergency working capital facilities or loan repayment deferrals for business customers can be considered.Within my Department, the enterprise support agencies are available to offer advice to client businesses requiring assistance.  The normal financial supports from these agencies remain available to clients.  I have asked the county and city enterprise boards in the relevant areas to report to me on the effects of the flooding on their clients' businesses.  The gathering of this information will intensify as businesses move to recovery stage and the extent of their needs becomes clearer.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, and I will assess as a matter of urgency this information when received.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I thank the Minister for her detailed reply.  I concur with her remarks about the people and statutory agencies who worked extremely hard to assist people in these adverse circumstances.  I sympathise with householders who suffered huge losses and have been displaced from their homes and with the small and medium sized business and farming community.  I have first-hand evidence of what happened in Athlone, Longford, Cavan, Carrick-on-Shannon and so on.  Huge devastation has been inflicted on households and small and medium sized enterprises across the geographical area.  The flooding has washed away years of hard toil and perspiration and has left in its wake a trail of destruction, devastation and massive loss.These people, including householders, business people and farmers, will have to pick up the pieces during the next couple of months.  For those who have insurance, the first port of call for them will be their insurance company and statutory agencies such as the local authorities.  I know Westmeath County Council and Athlone Town Council have done the best they can within meagre and limited resources, which we must never forget.  There are, however, people who do not have insurance and who are in a precarious situation.  These people may not have been able to obtain insurance because they previously made a claim in respect of flooding.  We are aware that businesses are facing challenging times and are urging people to shop local and support local businesses that have been affected in recent weeks by the flooding.  Insurance companies may cover companies who make a claim for flood damage if such flooding is random.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I will call the Deputy again on a supplementary question.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Members may have heard on "Frontline" on Monday night Mr. Peter Callan, a window manufacturer who expressed concern for the welfare of his employees and Mr. Finn from Gort who expressed his concerned about his furniture factory, employees and neighbours.  Deputy Wall spoke of the steel manufacturer in Athy which has closed with the loss of ten jobs.Given the current situation, could a grant aid system be devised to assist people to replace machinery and equipment?  This could be administered through the county enterprise boards.  Is it not time to look afresh at this issue and to consider the introduction of a national insurance scheme for people living in flood plains who cannot obtain insurance?  We need to start thinking outside the box.  Perhaps the Minister will address those two issues.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The Deputy's idea is a good one, which perhaps we should consider.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I hope the Minister will consider it.  I am not point scoring.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	328	No.  This is a serious issue for the people concerned.  I suggested the county enterprise boards deal with this issue given their local knowledge and so on.  They have come back to me with an initial response in terms of what is happening locally.  Some people have made contact and others have not.  I have asked the county enterprise boards to reaffirm what is happening and to, if at all possible, ascertain if people are insured.  I echo the call made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, that the insurance companies be up-front with those who are insured in terms of providing seed capital to assist them to get back on their feet.  Without a doubt, a number of companies have agreed to do this, which is good.On the CEBs, until such time as we assess need — some individuals have been in touch with me and my offices and we are working with them and their insurance companies or banks — we cannot articulate the overall Government response.  The Deputy's proposal for the introduction of a national insurance scheme merits consideration.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Perhaps I can make some other suggestions.  I do so in an effort to be constructive.  Perhaps local authorities could be encouraged to grant rates and charges waivers to affected businesses and households.  This would be useful.  Perhaps also the Government could — this was mentioned this morning by Deputy Sheahan — take steps to amend the Credit Union Act 1977 to allow credit unions to extend from five years, which is currently the maximum period, to ten years the period in respect of loan repayments.  Will the Minister ask the famous banks, whom the people subjected to this flooding are bank-rolling through their taxes, including householders, farmers and small businesses, to assist specific householders and businesses?  These people have been identified by the local authorities in Cork, Westmeath, Leitrim and Galway.  Will the Minister request the banks to reduce their overdraft rates, which are excessive, and to give people term loans at a competitive rate?  A drop of 2% in this regard would be significant.  It would be akin to the Government giving people a grant of, say, €15,000 or €20,000.  It is important this is done.  Perhaps also they could be asked to lengthen the period of repayment and to advance term loans and overdraft facilities at discounted rates, all of which would be positive steps.Will the Minister liaise with the banks to ensure they do their job with regard to the people who have been affected by the flooding, including small businesses, farmers and so forth?  The bank representatives have appeared before the Oireachtas committees.  They tell the committees one thing but 48 hours later we hear something different.  One day they did not need capital but 48 hours later they did need capital from the Government.  The banks must meet their commitments without fudging or dodging.  They should play a positive role to help this country get back on its feet and to help the businesses, householders and farmers who are suffering.  I seek positive action from the banks, not mealy-mouthed responses.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I would not disagree with the Deputy's comments.  The Minister of State has met with the banks' representatives on a number of occasions.  We have called on them to support people in a pragmatic way.  As I indicated, the Bank of Ireland has done so and my assumption is that at local level all the relevant banks will involve themselves with the humanitarian needs of these businesses, farmers and others who have been affected substantially by the flooding.  Equally, an up-front payment from the insurance companies would be hugely beneficial.  This issue was raised at the meeting with the Small Business Forum last week.  The Minister of State took the meeting after I had to come to the House.  We had further discussions on the matter in that context.We will continue to engage on these issues.  We can also engage with the Department of Finance on consideration of the amendment to the Credit Union Act.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	336	Enterprise Ireland is the lead Government agency responsible for the development of indigenous enterprise.  The fundamental objective of the current Enterprise Ireland strategy is to drive export growth momentum and internationalisation in what is an increasingly challenging and competitive environment for companies.  Enterprise Ireland's strategy, Transforming Irish Industry 2008-2010, identified four key strategic targets for the three year period.  In 2008, despite the unprecedented downturn in the global economy, Enterprise Ireland met or exceeded its yearly targets.  As stated in Enterprise Ireland's annual report 2008, agency client companies created 10,522 jobs last year.Given the global economic turmoil, 2009 was a tough year for foreign direct investment, FDI, but IDA Ireland continued to win projects and, to date in 2009, there have been 47 IDA announcements with the potential to create more than 2,500 jobs.  The IDA's focus continues to be on transformation, minimising losses as well as creating new jobs.  The IDA is working with its existing client base to deepen and further embed their investments in Ireland.  The agency has an active programme of engagement with clients to identify and target new investment opportunities from these clients.  IDA client companies employ in excess of 136,000 full-time workers at present.  The IDA continues to encourage and assist its client companies to move up the value chain in terms of both carrying out higher skilled operations and expanding their presence in Ireland.  The aim is to retain existing clients, to improve the quality of employment opportunities in Ireland and to increase the positive economic impact.  Ireland is now seen by the global business environment as a prime location for research, development and innovation functions.  The IDA has played a key role in establishing this competitive advantage for Ireland and is heavily involved with all stakeholders to capitalise on this aspect.The role of the county enterprise boards is to support the micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases, to develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate entrepreneurship at local level.  The overall priority for capital expenditure by the boards is on the development of sustainable growth-orientated micro-enterprises which, over time, can develop into strong export entities.  The boards have a successful job creation record to date with the creation of more than 33,000 jobs in CEB assisted businesses throughout the country since the inception of the boards in 1993.  In the current economic climate the expectation is that the demand for the services of the boards will increase as a greater number of people look to self-employment as an alternative to unemployment.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I asked for the job predictions for the next three years.  That is the information I am seeking.  I am trying to be helpful and to work on this.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	340	None of those agencies prophesises the future.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	341	That is very strange because they always prophesised the future previously.  Enterprise Ireland and the other bodies always gave predictions for job creation in the years ahead.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	342	No.  The annual report showed the number of jobs created.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	343	No, Minister.  Its representatives used to come to Oireachtas committee meetings and give a rough estimate of the jobs they hoped to create.  I hope the Minister is wrong and that they have plans to create jobs in the years ahead.  If the Minister of State cannot tell me about them today, perhaps he will undertake to find out what their predictions are for job creation for the next couple of years.  When unemployment is at more than 400,000 they surely must have some idea of what jobs they expect to create in the future.  That is the least we can seek.  If these agencies do not have plans, what plans do the Ministers have?  If they do not have plans, I ask them to do me a favour and look at our document, New Era.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	344	We did.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Perhaps the Minister of State would comment on it.  We believe it is a good document that is well thought out and well costed.  It is a good initiative and we believe it will create more than 100,000 jobs over the next four years.  In the absence of plans for job creation from these Ministers and their agencies, perhaps they will examine ours.  If the Minister thinks it is wrong, she should tell us where and we can change it.  However, they should work with us on it.  The Minister of State must reply to me with some predictions.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Send the Minister of State a copy.

If there are any good proposals, we will certainly examine them.  In the broader context, the IDA does not say how many jobs it will create in a year.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	349	It does.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	353	The IDA is charged with the function of creating as many jobs as possible.  Its purpose is to attract foreign direct investment and to support companies locating in this country.  The reverse is the case with Enterprise Ireland, whose purpose and function is to promote and sustain as many jobs as possible, as opposed to having particular targets.  Its purpose is to establish companies in Ireland, bring them up the value chain and assist them in accessing markets internationally.  The idea that on 1 January of any year they would state they will create a certain number of jobs in that year would not be operational.  What we are doing on a continuous basis is supporting employment and the number of jobs that flow from that as a consequence.  Take the example of the 47 announcements by the IDA this year and the 10,500 jobs created with the assistance of Enterprise Ireland.  At the start of 2008, however, the agencies did not specifically state they would create X number of jobs.  That would be a very foolish way to operate.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I am very nervous for the future given that the Minister of State tells me he has no predictions, aims or targets to create jobs.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	356	That is what I asked about in the question.  With respect, it is true that Enterprise Ireland makes predictions.  Its representatives appeared before an Oireachtas committee two years ago and predicted it would create 10,000 jobs.  It makes predictions and the Minister should not try to tell me I am wrong about that.  It is its job to do that.  If the Minister does not have that information today, I ask him for the last time to come back to the House in the next couple of weeks with the predictions so we can work with them.  At least we produced a document which we believe can create jobs, although I do not believe the Minister has read it.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	357	We did.  It is a regurgitation of the last document.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	390	The objective of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-13, SSTI, and the National Development Plan 2007-13 is to make a transition to a knowledge economy to enable Ireland to compete in a highly competitive global market.  In December 2008, the Government reinforced the importance of this investment in a document, entitled Building Ireland's Smart Economy — A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, which prioritised continued investment in science and engineering infrastructure and research.The infrastructure investment underpinning the SSTI is central to economic recovery.  The commercialisation of our research investment and the creation of a successful track record in the area of higher education research, as well as output of quality graduates at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, will be an important aspect of building a sustainable enterprise base underpinned by productive innovation activity across the economy.I am confident that there have already been achievements arising from the strategy.  The recently published report, Science, Technology and Innovation — Delivering the Smart Economy, confirms that, overall, substantial progress has been made in the achievement of SSTI objectives.  We are building strong linkages to ensure diffusion and commercialisation of an increased flow of new ideas and knowledge to produce innovative products and services that will win export markets and create much needed sustainable employment.Innovation, through better products, processes and business models, supported by near-to-market research and collaboration with knowledge providers, is the primary way for Ireland to gain a competitive advantage and secure export growth.  With regard to the commercialisation of research, Enterprise Ireland, EI, offers a suite of supports to academics and institutions to commercialise their research and build the commercialisation system.  These include funding provided through the €25 million commercialisation fund as well as funding and support for effective technology transfer offices in university campuses, commercially relevant research centres in institutes of technology and campus incubation facilities to support new technology companies in their formative years.  This programme to realise the commercial potential of Ireland’s research community is supported in 2009 by a projected level of investment of €36 million.  As at November 2009, the EI-supported technology transfer offices facilitated the creation of 20 start-up companies, 339 invention disclosures, 97 priority patents filed and 47 technology licence transfers between companies.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Enterprise Ireland, EI, is focused on promoting and facilitating the effective transfer and commercialisation of research, which is critical to ensuring Ireland benefits from the State's investment in research.  All EI supports are oriented towards securing commercially viable products processes and services for sale on international markets.  EI has put in place a stringent due diligence process, including commercial and economic assessment, along with a comprehensive metric system, to monitor progress against these objectives.  I will ensure that EI will maintain and intensify this focus.Complementary to the supports provided by EI, Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, is supporting 29 world class research centres across the Irish universities and institutes of technology.  The 29 centres comprise ten centres for science, engineering and technology and 19 strategic research clusters.  These centres are a major magnet of attraction that significantly enhance IDA Ireland's capacity to win research-intensive investments.  Through these centres and individual competitive grants, SFI-funded researchers are collaborating and interacting with in excess of 300 leading multinationals and indigenous firms.  It is through this close industry engagement that SFI is supporting companies that employ more than 56,000 people in Ireland.Notwithstanding the significant progress that has been made in recent years with regard to the commercialisation of research and development investment, I have received requests from enterprise representatives to consider, against the background of the current economic downturn, aligning SFI's activities more closely with the needs of enterprise.  My Department is currently examining extending SFI's remit to enable it to fund its researchers to pursue applied research opportunities arising from their own oriented basic research and to bring concepts and ideas arising from their research to the stage where EI programmes, and indeed private industry, can take them further, resulting in new products, processes and companies and the economic benefits associated with this.  This would also bring a renewed focus on applied research.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	391	My question was on the way in which resources are allocated.  I take from many of the Minister of State's comments that he is happy with the situation.  The McCarthy report, the outputs of which I am looking forward to in the upcoming budget, noted that the emphasis in funding science, technology and innovation seemed to be on the publication of articles as opposed to more concrete economic measures.  The report recommended a shift in emphasis to ensure commercial returns for resources over a certain period and a move away from emphasising the number of papers published, patents registered and so on.  Does the Minister of State wish to comment?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	392	There have been a number of positive outcomes and we should not be dismissive of people in universities publishing more papers.  Indeed, this was the basis of many people's criticism——
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I am not being dismissive, but there could be a more commercial focus for the money being spent.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	394	It is important that the Deputy not be dismissive of people publishing or applying a cross-commercial paradigm.  We need both components.  We need more publications from academics and more commercially relevant research from the third level sector.  It is not a question of one or the other, but this discussion is a simplification of what is being done in terms of research and development.  We need cutting edge research from universities as well as more commercialisation.The results of the trebling of spending on research and development in recent years have been good.  Since 2005, there has been a trebling of the number of new patents and invention disclosures and a doubling of the number of spin-out companies from the third level sector.  I am not saying this to be complacent.  We have a good track record, but we need to up the ante.  Deputy Clune's remarks reflect the word coming to us from the enterprise sector via our enterprise feedback group and our innovation task force.  We need to squeeze more from less in the years ahead.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I want to allow Deputy Clune back in for a brief supplementary question.  I want to keep the debate flowing.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Is the emphasis in the smart economy not on developing and creating jobs?  If so, there must be a commercial return.  I would not dismiss this outlook as being crass.  Consider the amount of funding invested in science and technology.  The McCarthy report outlined that, of the more than 90 schemes, some 60 involve funding towards PhDs.  Has the Minister of State any plans to streamline this type of funding?In recent months, people were shocked that the FÁS Discover Science and Engineering programme needed to be axed, but funding was spent on similar schemes across other boards.  Is there a commitment to ensure that funding on science and technology is not spread across various agencies and, instead, is more focused?  There is evidence that the current approach displaces private sector investment.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I agree with some aspects of the McCarthy report, but not others.  Mr. Colm McCarthy suggested a further 14% cut in spending, but this might be too much.  However, he made some valuable recommendations.  In the context of our Estimates discussions with the Department of Finance in advance of the budget, we would support the idea of a single funding line as opposed to scattering the funding over a number of Departments.  We would favour his recommendations on, as the Deputy rightly mentioned, the degree of fragmentation across agencies, not just Departments, of the delivery of the science spend, including EI, Science Foundation Ireland, IDA, the prestigious Marine Institute, Teagasc and many others.  There must be consolidation and I will fight for this aspect of the McCarthy recommendations, particularly given the fact that we are facing a squeeze on the level of funding available.  We must consolidate the spend to get a commercialised output and ratchet it up even further.  I thank the Deputy for her comments and support.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 66 and 68 together.As I have outlined to the House in recent months, in supporting small and medium-size enterprises, SMEs, the Government's focus has been on actions to sustain a positive business environment, including the proper functioning of the banking system, allied with specific targeted supports for SMEs through my Department's enterprise development agencies.Developments in the financial sector and wider economy during the last year have broadened the concerns for SMEs in terms of gaining access to finance and bank credit.  My Department and I have held regular meetings with the representative bodies of the SME sector and other stakeholders regarding issues impacting on the sector.  The Government established the round table talks on access to bank credit and subsequently the credit supply clearing group, with a dedicated e-mail contact point on my Department's website to deal with access to bank credit issues specifically.We are all aware of SMEs' difficulties in accessing credit.  We want to collate the information and present it to the banks in a scientific manner by way of explanation of those difficulties.  Every Deputy who speaks in the Chamber highlights the issue, but we need detailed information.  This has been forthcoming, including from Deputies.The Government has focused on creating a fit-for-purpose banking system and has taken actions to sustain the banks and facilitate the flow of credit to the wider economy to ensure that all banks are effectively good banks and can provide the normal range of services to business clients.  The bank guarantee and recapitalisation schemes, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the passing of the NAMA Act are all aimed at this.  The NAMA Act has been further strengthened by the Government amendment providing the Minister for Finance with a power to issue guidelines to the participating institutions in the NAMA process on lending practices and procedures to improve the flow of credit to small and medium-size enterprises and, if necessary, to other sectors.There has been a major downturn in the global economy.  We are in an international recession and our export markets in some areas have shrunk.  The weakness of sterling vis-à-vis the euro is putting considerable pressure on particular sectors of the economy.  We also had impaired banks and balance sheets.  Let us be honest — accessing credit on international markets and allowing a flow of credit into the SME sector has proven difficult for banks since last year’s bank guarantee.  However, there has been a reduction in the demand for credit, as has been borne out by the Mazars report.  Another Mazars report on a more up-to-date analysis of lending practices and the flow of credit into the SME sector will be published soon.  This is a major difficulty.  If credit dries up, it can cause the economy to grind to a halt.  The banks have been recapitalised.  Now that NAMA is in place, the impaired balance sheets can start to be addressed.  Responsible lending practices are needed to ensure there is a flow of credit into small and medium-sized businesses.  If businesses that are struggling, but are potentially sustainable over the short to medium term, can get to the other side of the downturn, they will be in a position to retain as much employment as possible.Everybody accepts that the small and medium-size sector is the backbone of the economy.  There is a very strong innovative and entrepreneurial instinct in Ireland.  The strong yearning of the Irish people to set up businesses on a regular basis has been fostered at every level, primarily by agencies like the county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland.  As I said in response to a previous question, such bodies are very supportive of those who are spawning enterprise, innovation and research.  We are very conscious of the need to continue to do everything we can in this regard.  We met representatives of the banks last week to discuss how European Investment Bank money can be pushed into the economy.  The officials in question will be able to go back to the European Investment Bank, which has said it will make further moneys available at preferential lending rates.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	399	The Minister of State has said he is doing everything he can.  He mentioned that round-table meetings are being held to collect information, etc.  He did not acknowledge the truth of the problem — the reality of why it is the way it is.  The European Investment Bank money is new money.  The real problem we have is with working capital.  The long-standing overdraft facilities of businesses are being reduced, removed or turned into loans.  Businesses are being told that the margin on their interest rates over the EURIBOR is being increased.  Some charges that were refunded to businesses in the past are not being refunded anymore.  Charges are being increased and cheques are being bounced.These problems are associated with working capital, by and large, rather than with new lending.  This is happening because the banks are bust.  That is the truth of it.  It is not necessarily badness on the part of the banks.  The banks' developer loans are not working.  Just 65% of their small business loans are performing.  Their personal loans and their mortgages are in serious trouble.  The banks are bust.  No round-table meeting or other information-collecting mechanism will make a difference.  Does the Minister of State not agree that the only thing the Government can do to restore credit to business is to establish a new bank from scratch and capitalise it with State money so that it can lend to business?

The Deputy is right to assert that issues with short-term working capital are creating major difficulties, such as reductions in overdraft and current account facilities.  Such issues are having a huge impact on small and medium-sized businesses.  As their cash flow reserves are gone at this stage, such businesses are having to work off current accounts and overdrafts.  The inclination of the banks to reduce overdraft facilities over a short period of time is putting huge pressures on small and medium-sized businesses.  It is essential for the members of the credit supply clearing group to meet and to the correct information.  The group was established to discuss these issues, highlight the difficulties that exist and collate all the information.  If people have difficulties, they can bring them to the attention of the group.  I assure the Deputy that I am like a mini clearing group, in the sense that people contact my office every day to discuss the difficulties they are having.

If they want to deal with them personally, they can do that instead.  We are conscious of the importance of this fundamental issue.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that regardless of what else happens, we need to have functioning banks that can access money.  Fine Gael believes that a nationalised bank should be established.  We believe that what we have done will stimulate the supply of credit into the economy.  Small and medium-sized businesses will suffer, unfortunately, if there is no demand for goods and services.  Both sides of the economy have to be stimulated.

We will have to wait until the autumn of next year, at least.  Does he accept that the representatives of Enterprise Ireland who are working with the banks are not operating as they should?  As Deputy Varadkar said, the banks simply do not have any money to give.  Does he accept that the banks are lying when they say they are giving loans to business and meeting their responsibilities?  They are not doing so.  Is it not the case that we will have to wait for another year before something practical happens to create a credit stream to small and medium-size enterprises?  Surely the Government can do something practical to make it happen.

We have to live in the real world as well.  The difficulty is that there has been a global downturn.  We have a recession in this country.  There has been a contraction of the economy.  There has been a drop in demand for credit.  Equally, there has been a drop in demand for the goods and services offered by small and medium-size businesses.  The Deputy also asked about the extent to which Enterprise Ireland is working with the banks.  The Tánaiste is in discussions about the establishment of a forum, comprising representatives of the banks, Enterprise Ireland and other stakeholders, to discuss these issues again.  In the meantime, Enterprise Ireland is discussing these issues with the banks on a continual basis.

For many years, the banks offered loans on the assumption that they had securities in the form of rising property prices.  Businesses now have to be assessed on the basis of profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and business plans.  As a consequence of the different lending and banking practices that were in use until recent times, some of the banks do not have the skills sets they now need.  We are continually trying to address the system.  The reality if that if we had not guaranteed bank deposits this time last year, at a very precarious time, we might not be talking about the banks at all because they might have capsized.  Although the banks have steadied the ship, we are not yet out of the woods.  Dubai, for example, recently defaulted on a sovereign loan.

Will he insist that the report contains a breakdown of new and existing funding?  The first Mazars report dealt purely with the amount of money — €32.4 billion — that had been given as credit to small and medium-sized enterprises by a certain date.  It gave the relevant figure six months after that date, but it did not break down the figures to highlight the extent to which overdraft facilities are being withdrawn.  It did not state whether rolled-up interest was included in the €32 billion figure on the later date.  When representatives of AIB appeared before an Oireachtas committee recently, they said they had no problem with providing such a breakdown between new and existing lending.  Will she insist that the most recent Mazers report, when completed, will have a breakdown showing the level of funding being provided to existing businesses?Today Dell announced it is selling its plant in Poland.  The Tánaiste is in the House today.  It is critical that she should provide an assurance.  Has she sought an assurance from Dell on the implications of that sale for the Limerick plant and the 1,000 jobs still there?  Furthermore, will the Minister go back to Europe and ask the EU about the matter?.  It allowed €54 billion to be given by the Polish Government to allow Dell establish the plant in Poland.

Now we want to get Forfás and the Central Bank together to analyse this.Mazers 2 is also in there, assessing the credit demand.  Let us be honest.  There has been a drop in demand.  The first Mazers report clearly pointed out there was a drop in demand for credit simply because there was a contraction in the economy.  Companies and small and medium sized businesses that need to access credit, based on sound business projections and balance sheets, profit and loss statements and all that is done in normal everyday businesses, should be supported.  We are trying to ensure the banks do that and are monitoring it in that context, through Mazers.  Equally, Forfás is working with the Central Bank, analysing the type of credit that is being extended to small and medium-sized businesses.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 50, 73, 74 and 87 together.As part of the forensic analysis of the Irish credit insurance market I commissioned last July, KPMG consulted both large business groupings and also a range of individual companies which embraced a wide spectrum of business sectors, including the food sector, engineering and plastics. These companies operated in a range of export markets and involved various patterns of exports.  This engagement enabled the consultants to get first-hand knowledge of the experience of companies in seeking export credit insurance cover.The KPMG report established that only a very small level of Irish exports are insured, that the existing cover is heavily concentrated on a single sector and a single market, that total withdrawals of cover are much more prevalent than reductions.  It also found that the introduction of a State-backed short-term top-up scheme, where the risk period is less than two years, and where the market is prepared to provide partial cover, would be expensive and of very limited impact, and that a negligible number of jobs would be supported by such an initiative. In addition, it was established there are indications that this market is showing signs of recovery and that insurance companies should therefore begin to provide better levels of cover from now on.  Accordingly, based on the overwhelming weight of evidence in the KPMG report, the Government decided that a State-supported scheme of short-term export credit insurance should not be introduced.It must be appreciated that in these difficult times the Government must assess very carefully whether new proposed schemes and initiatives justify the expenditure involved.  In this case, it clearly would not.  As the KPMG report established, significant ongoing costs to the State would arise.  Annual costs in respect of quite a low level of intervention would be about €1.7 million and this cost would rise to tens of millions of euro if risk profiles shifted upwards.In any event, the wider issue of credit availability for business is much more significant for business and work is underway to address this, as part of the bank recapitalisation process.  In addition, schemes initiated by the Government earlier this year, such as the enterprise stabilisation fund and the employment subsidy scheme, have been established.With regard to the fact that other EU member states have introduced State-supported schemes, this development was fully considered.  Under EU State–aid rules, each such scheme must be approved by the European Commission and such approvals have included a condition that the level of premia to be paid by companies under any such scheme, should  be a multiple of regular premium levels.  These high premia have made such schemes very expensive for business and, as result, take-up has been less than anticipated.  In some cases other restrictive conditions have also been imposed, for example, the destination countries that can be covered.  In several countries, including France and the UK, the schemes had to be altered in order to encourage companies to avail of them.  Last month the UK Government signalled its intention to discontinue that scheme at the end of this month, because there are now signs of market recovery.The KPMG report also suggested that we should investigate a possible medium-term intervention.  This is very distinct from short-term cover, where the risk period is less than two years.  It should be appreciated that most Irish exports do not fall into the medium-term category, which caters more for large projects or infrastructural goods and services, but this may be relevant to some companies.  I am considering this option in the context of the action plan for trade, investment and tourism, which is being prepared at present, as recommended in the smart economy strategy.  It is not possible at this stage to give an exact date for anticipated completion of this work and the publication of the plan, although significant progress will have been made by the end of the year, with an expected final draft to be presented to the Cabinet committee on economic renewal very early in the new year.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	448	Is it open to those companies coming in under the two-year limit, which are unable to achieve export insurance through a banking system and for which the Government will not provide, to come forward if they have a suggestion or a way out to discuss same with a person in the Tánaiste's Department, or with the Revenue?  I have come across some cases in which companies are selling to somebody else based in this country who then sells on and does the exporting.  However, that has tax implications with regard to the destination countries.  As the Tánaiste knows, when the material reaches the foreign country duty will be put on the Irish price.  If people are faced with that scenario can they approach Revenue to try to arrange an agreement?  If they have other ways around this, in the absence of a Government-backed scheme, is the door open to other ideas and short-term initiatives that might help work through the problem?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	449	We are very open to this.  An attitude has slipped into this House which I do not like, namely, the notion that just because a person is not in the same party he or she cannot come and talk to Ministers about ideas.  It is very important that we share those ideas.  If there are issues of personal circumstances we would be more than happy to do what we can.  We speak to the Revenue Commissioners to see if we can facilitate people in the context of the overall picture.The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and I have been discussing the overall trade package with the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  I see merit in the context of the medium term where we are looking at export potential in new emerging markets.  This is what we are doing.  If we are going to have economic recovery and growth it will have to be based on exports.  There are risks in certain parts of the country.  As long as these are not completely adverse, I feel there is merit in looking at a credit insurance scheme.  The short-term measure, namely, €1.7 million means 66 jobs.The other concern I would have, which I articulated recently to the joint committee, is that only four companies are involved in this insurance.  That, in itself, is very restrictive for companies.  Equally, until we had these present difficulties, some companies did not realise they were insured and it came as a bit of a shock to them when the cover was taken away.If the Deputy has a particular issue he should give it to any of us and we will look after it for him.

She might provide an outline so that we may be able to understand whether it is a representative group.The difficulty with taking four or five questions together is that it is difficult for the Minister to reply to them and for us to tease out each one.  When is the action plan on trade investment and tourism due for publication?  Will the scheme be introduced and what will be the eligibility criteria?  I refer to Question No. 74.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Yes, there are a number of questions being taken together.  I will call the Deputy again.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	456	We had a very robust analysis.  KPMG was involved with the UK credit insurance scheme so we were using some of its knowledge.  We were operating from a different base than the United Kingdom at the time.  We carried out a forensic analysis and we have a comprehensive picture of the market.  Only 4% of Irish exports are insured.  The existing cover is heavily concentrated in one sector, the food sector, and on a single market, the United Kingdom.There was much consultation and several dozen companies were involved.  I met the farmers and representatives of the Irish Exporters Association and a number of the big food companies.  Enterprise Ireland was very much involved and used a cohort of its companies.  The plastics sector was included also.  We had a broad inquiry and we had considerable in-house knowledge on the basis of several meetings I had with many people.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	457	It seems the companies were all big.  Were there any SMEs at all?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	458	SMEs were very much involved also.  The SME sector, in itself, is not large in the context of obtaining credit insurance.I met some of the smaller foreign direct investment people who do not insure themselves but one should note it was some of the raw materials that were being imported that were not being insured.  This created some difficulties in itself and we had to meet some people about it.  The analysis was very robust because people were considerably and rightly agitated by the issue.  It is important to note that only 4% of companies were insuring exports.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I am not so sure about that.  We are always talking about encouraging SMEs to export and to balance business, yet companies I know that want to do so have no export insurance available to them.I understand the point the Minister makes on risk but if she is to develop the export market, she will surely agree we need some kind of export cover for companies.  If we want them to create jobs and revive the economy, we must realise the bigger opportunities are in the international markets.  Does the Minister accept companies are afraid to operate without export insurance and that this matter is worth serious consideration?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I do not disagree on the role of the SMEs in the export sector.  That is why the plan we have will be international and will focus on our trade opportunities.  Tied to it will be the export credit insurance scheme, which will be very complementary.Another issue raised is equally appropriate for consideration.  I was asked whether I would publish the report.  I am not in a position to do so on the basis that I and KPMG had to sign a legally binding confidentiality agreement with the insurance companies in order to obtain the information we needed.  Unfortunately, the information is not available because of its sensitivity.  However, the Deputy can rest assured that I was forensic in my questioning of KPMG in the context of what happened.  We have noticed that even the French scheme has not worked very well.  The United Kingdom has withdrawn and the operation has turned out to be very expensive.  The age of cheap money is gone and there are other methods by which insurance cover can be obtained through the banking sector.  I hope the market will come back into force and provide further cover.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	461	The high-level group on labour market issues was established under the provisions of Towards 2016: Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, which was ratified in October 2008.  The high-level group is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprises two representatives from each of the social partner pillars and senior officials from several Departments.  The group met in January of this year.  A framework for a pact for stabilisation, social solidarity and economic renewal was negotiated with the social partners in late January.  This pact covered a range of areas, including maximising employment and helping those who lose their jobs.Members of the high-level group were also among the participants in a meeting held on 24 September 2009 to provide suggestions arising from the practical experience of active labour market programmes.  The ideas raised on that occasion are feeding into current work in the area of further activation initiatives.The Cabinet sub-committee has co-ordinated a range of innovative and significant actions for protecting jobs and assisting those who become unemployed to return to the labour market.  Labour market issues have been discussed at ten of the Cabinet committee's 14 meetings.The new actions include doubling of the provision of training and work experience places managed by FÁS to over 130,000; increasing the referral capacity of FÁS employment services from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to 147,000 persons in 2009; and establishing the employment subsidy scheme to protect, directly or indirectly, over approximately 80,000 jobs at a total cost of €135 million over 2009 and 2010.  I assure the House that the area of employment, in all its facets, is a central priority for the Government.

I cannot believe this at a time in which unemployment is increasing rapidly and affecting young people under 25 in particular.  To whom does the group report?  When was it established? The Minister stated it was established under the provisions of Towards 2016: Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009.  That the group has met only once is extraordinary, certainly at a time when the unemployment rate is so high.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	465	As I indicated, it is part of the social partnership programme.  The group has been superseded by the Cabinet sub-committee on economic renewal, which has discussed labour activation measures at every meeting.  The group is a high-level group and is made up of officials.  It is not a ministerial group.  The ministerial work is done through the Cabinet sub-committee.  The work of the high-level group feeds into that of the Cabinet sub-committee in addition to other areas.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	471	No.  There was a meeting in September 2009 to analyse the labour market activation programmes.  The committee had points to make on these yesterday and I will be taking them on board in the context of quality assurance.  It is important to reiterate that the group has been superseded by the Cabinet sub-committee, which has met almost every fortnight.  All these matters are discussed at political level and implementation is carried out by the high-level group of senior officials.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	472	There is an awful problem in that there are too many committees and sidebars.  If one attends our committee and listens to politicians who are in contact with the people, one will note they are making suggestions every day, as they are paid to do.  A profitable step would be to scrap half the committees.  Reducing VAT and having PRSI exemptions would actually help to sustain and create employment and address the issue of competitiveness, particularly with regard to Government charges.  That is the way forward.  There is no need to bring in any more accountancy or legal firms or social partners.  It is a landscape which anybody can paint and anyone can put forward solutions.  We should have no more committees.  We should throw ourselves fully into the one black spot in the country, namely, the current rate of unemployment.  As Deputy Varadkar said earlier, half of our deficit is made up of unemployment benefit and social welfare payments.  There is a simple solution.  Let us all pull the rope the one way and forget about committees.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	473	That is exactly what has happened.  The Cabinet sub-committee on economic renewal is now the main committee dealing with all these issues.  Competitiveness, energy, tourism and education are all interlinked and are all under the auspices of one Cabinet sub-committee.  The implementation of policy is done through the high level group or additional work is put back into the committee.  Any decisions must go to the Cabinet for final appraisal.  There is one group which is completely focused and is representative of all Departments, depending on the agenda.  The activation agenda, the competitiveness agenda and energy are constant issues in the context of the discussions which take place.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The jobs initiative scheme was launched in July 1996 and continues to provide full-time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, unemployed for 5 years or more and in receipt of social welfare payments over that period.  The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  The programme is sponsored by voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not for profit activities.Following changes introduced by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, on 10 November 2004, no new entrants have been admitted on to the job initiative schemes.  However, contracts for existing participants are renewed allowing them the option to continue until they are 65 years of age.  Where persons leave the job initiative scheme, that place can be allocated as a community employment place.  The full range of FÁS services are made available to participants who leave voluntarily.The 2009 budget for the job initiative is €39 million and there are currently 1,444 participants, with this number decreasing annually due to retirement and other reasons.  The Government will continue to support the positive role of FÁS employment schemes in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.   The operation of this scheme is being kept under constant review in the context of current difficult unemployment.The jobs initiatives scheme forms part of the Government's response to unemployment.  Other initiatives include a doubling of the provision of training and work experience places managed by FÁS to more than 130,000 places, an increase in the referral capacity of FÁS employment services from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to 147,000 persons in 2009 and the establishment of the employment subsidy scheme to directly or indirectly protect approximately 80,000 jobs at a total cost of €135 million over 2009 and 2010.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I compliment the Minister of State on his reply, in particular the skilful way in which he avoided answering the question.  He would have made an excellent barrister.  The Minister of State knows that the McCarthy report indicated the jobs initiative scheme should be closed as soon as possible, something with which we do not agree, and that €10 million would be saved by off-setting the cost of accommodating the existing 1,400 participants on alternative schemes, compared to a gross saving of some €30 million.Does the Minister of State have a view on that?  If so, what is his position?  In a time where there is significant unemployment and solutions, which are well thought out and would contribute to tackling the scourge of unemployment, are ten a penny from the Opposition, why has the jobs initiatives scheme remained closed?  It was closed on 10 November 2004 by the Minister, Deputy Martin.  Why is such a blinkered approach being taken to a scheme which offers people opportunities?  It is a static scheme and there is plenty of room for development.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I remind the Deputy that I am not a barrister, and I am the only member of my family who is not.  I have always prided myself on saying that I am the most honest member of the family.  We will leave that matter for another day.We do not intend to finish the jobs initiative scheme.  Capped numbers are involved and people are allowed to participate until the age of 65.  The Tánaiste referred to the valuable work being done by the committee on economic renewal, of which I am proud to be a part.  It is generally recognised by Ministers and Deputies that many of the people who participate in these schemes are doing very valuable work for the communities in which they work.There is no intention on the part of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Government to disturb that reality.  However, we need to examine other training schemes to get a higher throughput of people because new people are coming forward.

Broughan — the urgent need for the Tánaiste to respond to the grave concerns in the voluntary, community and local development sector on the future of the jobs initiative and community employment schemes concerning reported changes to the regulations governing these schemes which will prevent many citizens from accessing work and training and will lead to a serious loss of staff in the various services and the need for the Tánaiste to respond positively to the strong representations I have made to her office on the matter; (3) Deputy Shane McEntee — the Minister's plans to ban stag hunting, (4) Deputy Mattie McGrath — An Bord Pleanála's recent decision to refuse planning permission for the Riussuir Development on Clonmel Road, Carrick on Suir, County Tipperary (details supplied); (5) Deputy Michael Ring — flooding problems in Mayo and specifically the report from ecologists on the Roundfort-Hollymount flood mitigation report; (6) Deputy Lucinda Creighton — the commencement notice of the Dublin Waste to Energy Project. (7) Deputy Joan Burton — the provision of permanent accommodation for Tyrrelstown Educate Together School and Mulhuddart National School; (8) Deputy John Perry — the proposed closure of the Tiscali call centre at Finisklin, County Sligo; (9) Deputy Beverley Flynn —  the closure of the Teagasc office in Castlebar, County Mayo; (10) Deputy Deirdre Clune — the provision of an extension to St. Francis College, Rochestown, Cork; (11) Deputy Ciarán Lynch — to ask the Minister for Health what options are available to a person (details supplied) told by HSE South to expect a decision on treatment for occipetal neuralgia within three weeks of October 2 but who is still untreated and in severe pain and if she will make a statement on the matter; (12) Deputy Leo Varadkar — the provision of permanent accommodation for Tyrrelstown Educate Together School and Mulhuddart National School; (13) Deputy Tom Hayes — the need to provide additional funding to South Tipperary County Council to repair local roads and alleviate flooding.The matters raised by Deputies Michael Ring, Tom Hayes, Shane McEntee and Lucinda Creighton have been selected for discussion.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Sinn Féin acknowledges that the Bill has some very positive elements but also warrants caution.  For example, the removal of the ceiling in the High Court for applications from €317,000, which is the current level, is very positive because it lifts a significant or potential financial burden from taxpayers, which is a reasonable policy.  We will leave it to the system and rely on the court to make proper decisions in that regard.  I have outlined several other positive elements which I will not discuss.It is interesting to note how quickly the Government can move when it decides to move, as it decided to move in terms of this Bill.  I am reminded of an issue which I referred to briefly when I interrupted the Minister of State's contribution, namely, the regulatory burden for small and medium size enterprises.  There is a significant difference between small and large companies.  For a company which employes 12 to 15 people to employ a person to do the work of a clerk and assemble the figures for InterStat or whoever is a major burden if it is something which takes two days a week or five or six days a month.  If one compares it to a company with 100 to 210 employees, which would probably have an information technology system in place where one can hit some buttons and assemble and send off the figures, it is clear there is a disproportionate burden in terms of administrative costs on small and medium size enterprises.The Minister of State told us earlier that he hopes to have the Bill before the House in the autumn of next year to assemble and reform it——
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I said I would publish it.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The Minister of State said the Bill would have 1,300 amendments, which will keep us going for quite a while.  I hope the Dáil will resume early next year so we can spend a large chunk of September dealing with the Bill to try to pass it as quickly as possible.  It has taken longer than was necessary to bring it before the House.  I am not denying that significant work was involved.  The outcome of the Bill is what is important, namely, a reduction in the regulatory burden on business so there can be fewer overheads and more efficiency, which is a critical element of the Bill.  I hope the Minister of State will bear that in mind and realise that the sooner the Bill can be brought before the House the better because it is long overdue.The current trend continues to be a greater imposition of regulatory burden on business.  We do not want more regulation but better, more efficient regulation.  We need regulation, which if it has to be administered, can be done through efficient IT systems.  Perhaps the various State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland could offer some assistance to companies.  The county and city development boards could offer assistance to companies in terms of IT packages that would streamline some of that work and help business to be more efficient.  Clearly, the upward surge in costs to businesses in recent years has hampered the creation of jobs and of export markets.  I hope the Government will take that seriously and address it as quickly as possible.  We look forward to working with the Government in that regard to clear up that legislation when it comes before the House.  I hope it will be sooner rather than later.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I wish to share time with Deputy Connaughton.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	487	Is that agreed?  Agreed.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Bill, which is part of an exercise to consolidate 14 other Acts into one.  Its purpose is to allow US subsidiary firms based in Ireland to temporarily use the US accounting standards when producing their accounts.  We need to view all this in the context of investment in the country and job creation.  Many Members of the House will recall occasions in the past — the distant past, thankfully — long before globalisation became an in-word and the movement of investment out of this country and the loss of jobs, when one would have to question the accounting and auditing practices of foreign companies operating in this country.  Thankfully, that has gone and the Bill will go some way towards eliminating difficulties that may have arisen and costs to the Exchequer as a result of court cases undertaken in order to justify particular procedures.We have had various strategies to spread job opportunities and investment equally throughout the country.  However, we now know that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have consolidated and focused essentially on four or five major centres, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and perhaps one in the midlands.  In the Government's spatial strategy, there was much ado about hub towns and gateway towns.  There was a legitimate anticipation that people would see an equal spread of investment throughout the regions.  However, tragically that has not happened as the Minister of State is well aware.  For example, my constituency has a gateway town in Ballinasloe and a hub town in Tuam.  We also have towns like Loughrea, Portumna and Gort.  A reply to a parliamentary question I asked in the not too distant past made it clear that IDA Ireland did not bring any major investors to those towns.  I do not know whether it was through its lack of initiative in focusing on those centres or whether it was a total lack of interest from foreign investment companies to come to any towns.  There is an onus on Government to implement the spatial strategy to give an equal spread of opportunity to the other centres I have just named.The Government has failed to recognise the importance of research and development and has made cutbacks in all third level institutions.  Were it not for the initiative of the staff and the current and former presidents at NUI Galway to encourage investment for research and development into Galway, the employment picture in Galway might be different.  The high-tech employment we have was in the main nurtured by the efforts and endeavours by those in the university to support it.While this legislation is important to regularise the accountancy of new firms, etc., it is important that the Government recognises that investment should and must be spread equally.  During Question Time, I heard Deputy O'Donnell refer to what could have happened in Limerick if certain actions were taken.  I can bring Members nearer to home.  CIGNA decided to move its operations away from Loughrea because of globalisation and our lack of competitiveness.  I was in consultation with the Minister of State who was very positive on an application to European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.  However, there was a failure on the part of Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the other agencies that had come together to form a task force in Loughrea to complete the application form for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, similar to what happened in Limerick.  The failure to make an application to Europe for funds for additional training for the many people who lost their jobs in Loughrea indicates something terribly wrong with the agencies responsible for nurturing, helping and supporting industries, particularly at a time of crisis when so many people are losing their jobs due to lack of competitiveness.It is important that agencies like Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are fair to all areas of the country and do not concentrate solely on Galway, Limerick, Cork and Dublin that they regard as attractive — although they will deny saying it — with the rest of us looking on.  Why did the Government introduce a spatial strategy concentrating on Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar, while ignoring a town like Ballinasloe that was lost to industry?  Three major industries were lost there in a matter of years and the Government could not see the merit in having four centres rather than a three-way triangle for industrial development.  Ballinasloe and east County Galway in general have been left in a wilderness without industrial development.  It is great to see development in Galway city to where many people commute.  However, the Government's spatial strategy has been ignored by those agencies and we have relied on the efforts of the county enterprise board and Galway Rural Development Company to create jobs in small units.  They were encouraged by these agencies but have been starved of finances while the other agencies do not know what to do with it and hence they go off on their various excursions to foreign lands in the guise of seeking employment opportunities and training.The Government should promote the potential of all areas rather than the concentration and focus on a few major areas for job creation when the opportunity presents itself again.  We should never again see a reply to a parliamentary question that there was no visit by IDA Ireland.  It could not even encourage industrialists of any foreign or indigenous source to visit towns such as Ballinasloe, Tuam or Loughrea.  There is something wrong in those agencies if they cannot achieve that.  There are examples.  It is on the record that they have failed to take the initiative in persuading industrialists to even consider locating in those towns.  It may be necessary to change the structure of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, including by amalgamating them, to ensure this is followed through and that there is a fair chance for everyone in the country.  It is the same for other areas throughout the country.  We cannot let these people continue on their merry way, saying nobody is interested in going to this town or that town.  That is not the case.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I read the Minister's speech with interest and I do not think anyone could quibble with the main principles of the Bill.  It appears to be concerned with accounting procedures.  I cannot say I fully understand the concept involved because I am not an accountant, but I know enough to say that if it will cost American firms more to comply with the accounting procedures of both the US and the EU, that is a good reason for this Bill.This is an opportune time to talk about industrial development.  Contained in this Bill is a type of understanding that if there are certain things that are now necessary, this will in some way greatly benefit the economy.  I have no doubt this is important and that is why I accept it as such.  However, if the Minister thinks what is contained in this Bill will dramatically change inward investment from the United States or anywhere else, he may be mistaken.Only a few years ago we were first in the world in terms of the competitiveness of our exports; now we are approximately 24th.  We took our eye off the ball.  Nobody knows this better than the Minister because he works at it every day.  We have the most expensive telephone system in the world.  With all the talk about competition, there is not a lot happening in that regard.  We certainly have the most expensive electricity and gas.  That is not a political point; it is a matter of fact.  Our wages are out of kilter as well.  Yet we put together that package and try to compete on a global market to attract the people that are good to Ireland.I take my hat off to the Americans and anybody who would create thousands of jobs in this country.  However, the minute it is more profitable to shift the system somewhere else — somewhere they will make more money — they are gone, whether they are Americans or anyone else.  That is simple economics.  Yet the Government, for the past ten years, did not see it that way because it was consumed with the construction bubble.  The money was coming in as though there were leprechauns jumping over every ditch in the place with pots of gold.  The Government never thought it would see the end coming.  It never thought it would have to face the music, as we will in the House next Wednesday when the greatest hair-shirt budget that has ever been visited on the Irish people will be read out from the very seat on which the Minister is sitting.We must go back to basics.  Until such time as we get our economy back into kilter, we must live on what we produce.  It is as simple as that.  We have four million people and are not bestowed with oil wells or anything similar.  Most of the time we import products, manufacture items and re-export them.  In recent years we have had a large amount of indigenous industry, which is important to us, and of course the service industry.  However, we have found out to our cost in the past four or five years that this may not be enough.  There is an industrial estate at Tuam in County Galway which must be one of the most elite industrial estates ever built.  One would think one was going into the Taj Mahal, with beautiful gates and the whole works.  However, the only people who have had jobs there in the past three years were those who were working there before.  Not a single job has been created there, although it cost millions to build.  Yet we are glad to have it in Tuam because we hope companies will be established there.We cannot understand the situation.  Actually, I understand it well: unless the underlying conditions are good, people will not commit millions in such investments.  We have a good workforce, but unfortunately there are now many more people looking for jobs.  People get fed up when they hear the word "competitiveness", but if we do not whip costs into line, the Bill means nothing to anyone.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.When the national spatial strategy was launched, there was not a Minister, for weeks on end, who was not above in a box talking about all the good things this would bestow on Ireland.  We had gateways and we had something called a hub, if you do not mind.  Governments are great for all kinds of definitions.  All I know about hubs is that Tuam was one, but I cannot see what was bestowed on the town of Tuam.  The hospital was let go and the new one was never built.  I have spent a lifetime at this and I know that the further one moves away from the economic heart of the country, which is Dublin city, the harder it is to persuade industrialists to travel there.  That has been the case for years.  There have been a number of changes which will help us — the new N6 road to Galway, when it opens in a few weeks' time, the airport and Knock and so on.  They are all useful in their own way.  It is ironic that we now have the infrastructural set-up, which we never had before, but our competitiveness has gone out of kilter so we still cannot win.Obviously there must be an integrated approach by everybody but, unfortunately, time is not on our side.  Despite all the talk about rationalisation and the ESB and Eircom, I am not seeing the required reductions in the cost of services.  Let us take the bin collection, for example, or the cost of water.  They are all utilities that bear no relation to the profits that companies may be able to make.  These costs are outrageous.  If we do not accept these simple facts we will have serious trouble encouraging companies to locate here.There are a number of things in our favour.  Most American companies that may come to Ireland or are already here believe we have a good and adaptable workforce and are situated in a good place in the EU.  However, if we do not get the other factors right quickly we will be in serious trouble.The people of east Galway sent me here, just as the people of Tallaght sent the Acting Chairman.  It is important to disperse opportunities around the country.  This has been a hobby-horse of mine for years.  I am not silly enough to believe that large anchor industries can be placed in areas such as Mountbellew, where I live.  That is why it is important to have the system whereby we have a good Galway, a good Sligo, a good Letterkenny and so on.  I compliment the Western Development Commission on the documents it has brought out to show the disparity between the east coast and the west.  If nothing else, it gives us an opportunity to speak about this in the context of this Bill.  I hope that the Bill will do what the Minister of State said it will do, but there is a great deal more to be done.

I look forward to the Committee Stage debate next week.There are a few issues to clarify.  First, the purpose of this Bill is to address a few simple accounting difficulties that have arisen in the context of companies locating their headquartering facilities here.  It is not to cater for every company.  There are a number of strategic companies which are large employers.  They are very reputable companies and they make a major contribution to the employment in this country.  It is not for every company that would like to do its accounting practices through other methods.On issues with regard to reputational damage, IDA Ireland, ODCE and the Revenue Commissioners were first and foremost asked to look at this as well.  We did our own due diligence.  What is critically important is that the US GAAP accounting procedures have exacting and high standards.  It is important to put that on the record.  US GAAP has good accounting practices and is internationally recognised as having that.  It is not that they are trying to move to a system where there are easier or more lapsed standards.  That is not the case.The primary purpose of the Bill is to assist companies that have moved here in recent times, which are headquartered and had facilities here, and want to move from US GAAP accounting to Irish GAAP or IFRS standards.  That is to be done over a period of time of not more than four years.  This provision runs out in 2015.Another issue with which some Deputies had grave concern — I know that they were not referring directly to me — and about which I would not have any concerns is the context of giving the Minister the authority to make regulation.  An important part of the Bill, section 2(4), states:Every regulation under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.The bottom line is that if the Minister makes a regulation, it is laid before the Houses and if either one of the Houses passes a resolution annulling that regulation, that is the case.  Therefore, there is democratic accountability included in the Bill at section 2(4).  It is critically important that people realise there is democratic accountability here.  I myself would have concerns if it was simply a matter of the Minister deciding to draft a regulation and hand it over to the officials, and that then the matter would be done and dusted.  It does not work like that and, thankfully, this provision in the Bill insists on regulations being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Democratic accountability to the parliamentary assembly is of critical importance.Reputational risk, as I stated, was raised by a number of Deputies and it would be critically important that no Deputy leaves it hanging in the air.  Either they have concerns or they do not.  We can alleviate any of their concerns if they look at what this is trying to achieve.  It is an interim measure.  There are already exacting standards in the US, including generally accepted accounting principles, and US GAAP.A number of issue were raised and if I forget any of them, we can refer to them again on Committee Stage.  Deputy Penrose spoke of Dr. Courtney and his fine volume on company law.  It is a fine read and I would urge every Member to read it before Committee Stage on Wednesday next.  It would be an interesting read over the weekend.

As outlined by Deputy Morgan, there will be 1,200 sections in that Bill.  It will be difficult and exacting, first, on the Company Law Review Group, but also on the officials who must interpret that and put it into format, on the Parliamentary Counsel and on everybody else involved.  It will be very exacting on the members of whatever committee it goes before in the context of winding its way through the Oireachtas.  It is another Bill to which I look forward.I will deal with a few basic issues here.  In response to Deputy Varadkar, the Director of Corporate Enforcement was consulted.  It enforces company law and the director did not have any major concerns with that aspect.  The Revenue Commissioners were also consulted.I repeat that these are very reputable companies.  Deputies asked if they were going to use different accounting standards for the purpose of gaining competitive advantage.  That is not the case.  The context of capital depreciation of equipment such as plant was raised by some Deputies, but that does not arise, nor will there be a potential loss of revenue to the State.

That is the purpose, rather than putting an onerous cost on them unnecessarily that they can over a period of time move from US GAAP to Irish GAAP or IFRS.  There are many acronyms in use in the Department.  The other day I was at the world trade talks where they have a language of acronyms of their own.  One would nearly want a dictionary of acronyms.I was asked why the issue of the stock exchange was included at short notice.  That issue did not come to our attention until quite recently.  It only came to our attention in the context of a director sitting on an inquiry established by IASSA and having to retire prior to the inquiry being completed.  It was brought to our attention in October last.  We were reacting to issues which were raised and which came to our attention at the time.The amendment of the funds industry is being published tomorrow.  Deputies will be able to digest that over the weekend as well and we will be able to deal with it on Committee Stage.  I have covered most of the other areas of particular interest to the Deputies.There is a consolidation of standards and, hopefully, over the next number of years one will see the various standards of accounting around the world coming together under a more unified code.  I would urge at every possible level that there would be a standardised, uniform generally accepted accounting principles in use by the European Union, the United States and other major economic blocs.I was asked if the Minister decided to make regulation and lay it before the Houses, and if it was discussed by the Houses and accepted, what other accounting standards may be under consideration.  At present, there are no other generally accepted accounting principles from other countries under consideration, but it would be unhelpful and would tie up the Oireachtas unnecessarily to have primary legislation debated through the Houses again to deal with one or two companies which may find that this issue is causing them difficulties in the short term.  It would be preferable to give the Minister the powers to lay regulations before the Houses for Deputies to consider.Canada and Japan also would have exacting accounting standards.  It is critically important to state that the legislation does not give the Minister a free hand to decide on any standard he or she may prefer.  There are exacting standards laid down in the legislation as to what he or she can consider in the context of placing a regulation before the House.  As regards the valuation of assets, these companies will follow the US GAAP to the extent that it does not conflict with company law. They will therefore follow these valuations.  That question was also raised by Deputy Varadkar.  The purpose of the Bill is that rather than putting excessive, onerous administrative costs on companies here that are employing many thousands of people, there will be a transitional period over which they can move from the US GAAP to the accounting centres of Ireland or IRFS.That is primarily the purpose of the Bill, which will now move on to Committee Stage.  Deputies expressed concerns about the funds industry and the fact that we are tabling an amendment at late notice.  It is not really at late notice, however, because we have until next Wednesday for Deputies to consider that amendment.  It will be primarily to allow funds to migrate in and out of the country.  The stock exchange issue was merely to clarify some of the matters that were raised by some companies.  It is to avoid administrative burdens being placed on them, but we are conscious of the need to notify markets.  There is already strong regulation and legislation in place regarding PLCs that are floated on the stock exchange in the context of purchasing own shares.  The requirements are onerous and rightly so.  Companies often purchase their own shares if they have surplus cash reserves.  There is nothing unusual or untoward in that.  It is part of the normal, everyday management of PLCs.  A notification process is already in place but in the context of this legislation we are saying it also must be put on the website.Reference was made to the fact that some people may not be aware of it, but the markets are always aware of these things.  I can assure the House that if it is put up on the website of any PLC, the markets know about it immediately.  People involved in trading and monitoring markets are aware of PLC websites, and that shares are being purchased.  In any case, they have to notify the stock exchange within a day of the shares purchase.I hope that covers most areas that were raised by Deputies concerning the Bill.  Broader issues were also raised in the context of Government policy on competitiveness, addressing the challenges of unemployment and regional development.  My comments may stray from the Bill, but I beg the indulgence of the Chair to refer to the issues that were raised by Deputies in that regard.  May I do so?

In Galway, for example, it concerns medical devices and some areas of life sciences.  They have international standing because of the size and scale they have achieved.  So the clustering of companies is very important.  Equally, the Government cannot dictate where a company locates.  The IDA's first purpose is to attract foreign investment to Ireland and thereafter it tries to show potential investors where there may be a regional jobs deficit.  Ultimately, however, it is the company that will decide where to locate.  All the IDA can do is to point them towards Ireland.

Planning is an issue that affects all of us in many aspects of our daily lives.  As I have said on many occasions, planning is about people.  For this reason, I have adopted a very hands-on approach when it comes to improving the planning system.Since coming into office, I have introduced a suite of guidance on sustainable residential development and on the integration of schools provision with the planning process.  New guidance is also in preparation on local area planning and controlling development along national roads.I also introduced regulations last year to encourage the uptake of cleaner and cheaper energy from renewable sources in the industrial, business and agricultural sectors by providing exemptions facilitating a greater penetration of renewable technologies in these sectors.  I have also taken a strong stance with certain local authorities by issuing directions requiring them to amend their development plans where they have included excessive or inappropriate zonings. It is the problem highlighted by this latter issue that has been a strong motivating factor in developing this Bill.The zoning of land through the development plan or local area plan processes is the basic decision that determines the quality of individual planning decisions on the ground.  The majority of planning issues we face as a society today — such as over-zoning, inadequate provision for public transport, flooding, community infrastructure and amenity, and fluctuations in house and land prices — can be addressed and corrected.  The lessons of the very recent past and the current flooding catastrophe have shown that we are suffering from inappropriate and chronic overzoning.  The evidence is there for all to see and, frankly, it is a damning indictment of our system.I am determined to put an end to the type of needless suffering and hardship we witnessed in the past week due to flooding.  The Bill provides the central lever in this respect by providing for the inclusion in development plans of an objective for the carrying out of flood risk assessment as part of the control and regulation of development in areas at risk of flooding.  My aim is to ensure that detailed flood risk assessment is fully integrated into the planning process.  The inclusion of this provision in the Act will work in tandem with the guidelines on the planning system and flood risk management published on 30 November.The key message from both the new provision in the Bill and the guidelines is the critical importance of addressing flood risk at the earliest possible stage in the planning process through the development plan.  In this context, the guidelines highlight the need for a review of land which has been already zoned for development without the benefit of a detailed flood risk assessment in accordance with the guidelines, and where flood risk is now shown to be potentially significant.It is no coincidence that our commuter towns are now suffering the most from the economic downturn.  These are the towns where house upon house was built, and field upon field re-zoned, with little thought given to flood risk assessment, or where nothing was provided by way of community facilities or amenities.  This is not my idea of sustainable communities.  Scatterings of estates, poorly linked by transport, under constant threat of flooding, distant from schools and dependent on transport by car, must become a feature of our past, not our present or future.  Sustainable, high quality living communities are what this country needs to assure its progression and competitiveness in the future.The Bill before us addresses the planning issues I have identified and deserves the support of Deputies.  I heartily welcome and acknowledge the constructive and robust contributions Senators have already made in developing this Bill.  I would also like to thank my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, for taking the Bill through Committee and Report stages in the Seanad.The purpose of the 2000 Planning Act, as stated in its long Title, is "to provide, in the interest of the common good, for proper planning and sustainable development".  I have the greatest respect for locally elected councillors and people in planning departments across the local government system.  They have managed to deal effectively with the large increase in the number and complexity of planning applications in the past few years.  I do not want their work contaminated by that small number of people who use the planning system for their own gain.I have already stated my intention to strengthen further the wider ethical framework for local government.  The Green Paper on Local Government examined the operation of the regime at local level and concluded that greater coherence could be brought to its operation.  The White Paper, which will be published shortly, will present a set of measures in that regard.  My Department is also preparing a Bill to provide for the election of the directly elected mayor of Dublin in 2010.  It is intended to use this Bill to introduce statutory protection for whistleblowers in the local government system building on the approach that has been introduced in many areas of the public service.This planning Bill ranges over a number of different areas in the planning code.  There are three parts in the Bill, which contains 40 sections, and I would now like to refer in some detail to the main provisions.  As I said earlier, a sound development plan is the key to ensuring good planning at local level.  Decisions taken at the development plan stage affect all other planning decisions.A key element of the zoning reform is the introduction in section 5 of a requirement for an evidence-based core strategy in development plans which will provide relevant information as to how the plan and the housing strategy are consistent with regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy.  The location, quantum and phasing of proposed development must be shown as well as growth scenarios, details of transport plans, retail development and proposals for development in rural areas.  This more strategic approach to zoning will allow development take place at the right time and in the right place and will allow the State to plan for the provision of infrastructure with much greater certainty.  This is key to the economic renewal agenda.Requiring tighter management of land zoning and ensuring that the location and quantum of land zoned for development is in line with regional and local targets for growth over the period of the plan will help local authorities prioritise the provision of their own infrastructure and services to those places most likely to be developed during the plan.Where the amount of zoned land in an area far exceeds the likely demand, as quantified in the core strategy of the development plan, I encourage planning authorities to consider using the existing down-zoning provisions in the 2000 Act.  Alternatively, the development plan needs to make it clear that zoned land will be serviced, and prioritised in local area plans, following a sequential approach, that is, developing within and out from existing urban areas, using public transport corridors as far as possible.  Development on "excess" zoned land will be regarded as premature until the need to develop such land is established in the core strategy of a future plan.Amendments passed on Committee Stage in Seanad Éireann will further obligate planning authorities to vary development plans to provide for a core strategy not later than one year after the making of regional planning guidelines.  This section provides that development plans will contain mandatory objectives for the promotion of sustainable settlement and transportation strategies in urban and rural areas, including appropriate measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Section 6 provides for the scope of submissions and observations on development plans to be much more strategic in nature.  The development plan-making process will be more transparent and will move away from being distracted by proposals for zoning particular land parcels to a more strategic land use planning approach.As a general approach, this Bill strengthens the status of regional planning guidelines and the role of regional authorities in the preparation or variation of such plans.  Development plans will have to be consistent with the relevant regional planning guidelines and regional authorities will be required to make submissions to planning authorities on the key issues which a regional authority believes should be considered in the preparation of a draft development plan.  The ongoing review and update of the regional planning guidelines to be finalised in the middle of next year, will be crucial to giving effect to this new legislative requirement.I have heard the concerns attributed to the Carlow strategic planning committee and indeed noted the press release issued on its behalf following on from its members' recent visit to the Seanad Committee Stage proceedings.  I hope they have listened carefully to the responses in the debate concerning the role of regional authorities and regional planning guidelines.These guidelines are a combination of top-down and bottom-up contents.  While regional planning guidelines are required to give effect to national spatial strategy objectives at regional level, they also reflect specific regional priorities.  These can include regional economic strategies, to address identified strengths and weaknesses within a region; regional flood risk management, for example where a river catchment crosses county boundaries; and conservation of the built and natural heritage within a region.These regional priorities are identified by the elected members and planning officials and are fed into the regional planning guidelines drafting process from the earliest stages, namely, the publication of the regional planning issues paper.  The draft regional planning guidelines are prepared on foot of this public consultation and feedback from the members of the regional authority who will eventually give their approval to go on to the next round of public consultations.  On foot of this the draft guidelines are modified as necessary and subsequently adopted by the members of the regional authority as final regional planning guidelines.Sections 7 and 8 deal with the making and varying of a development plan, including a requirement that the manager's report addresses separately the issues raised by the Minister or the regional authority and that the report must include appropriate recommendations in relation to how these issues are to be addressed.  This recognises the Minister's responsibility in law for the planning system and, in relation to the regional authority, its role in ensuring that regional planning issues are given due consideration in the shaping of the development plan.The introduction of new land zonings late in the development plan process without consultation does not accord with the principles of fairness or transparency.  All land zonings will now have to be the subject of public consultation at plan making stage or in a draft variation of a development plan. This is crucial from the point of view of ensuring public confidence in the zoning process.Under this Bill, any further changes proposed by members to those amendments to the draft development that had been subject to public consultation — that is, the second consultation period — must now be supported by a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of members as opposed to a simple majority.  I believe that this higher approval threshold should apply as such proposed amendments would not be subject to any further public scrutiny.  I also believe that decisions on development plans, one of the most fundamental powers available to elected members, must involve the majority of the members.  Similar provisions are also introduced under section 11 in relation to the local area planning process.I recognise that the intent of the two thirds majority voting threshold provisions could be made clearer in this Bill and it has been agreed with Senators that my Department will work with Parliamentary Counsel to bring forward Committee Stage amendments in this House to improve the text of these provisions.Section 10 provides that the mandatory population threshold for preparing local area plans is raised from 2,000 to 5,000 persons.  This move will in no way be to the detriment of rural settlements.  It will remain the case under section 18 of the Planning Act that a local area plan may be prepared in respect of any area which members of a planning authority consider suitable and, in particular, for those areas which require economic, physical and social renewal, irrespective of their population.The Bill provides that the discretionary threshold for the preparation of a local area plan will be where the population is between 2,000 and 5,000 and where the relevant area is to be subject to large scale development within the lifetime of the plan.  I believe that locally elected councillors are best placed to decide what areas would benefit from a local area plan.  This Bill in no way ties the hands of councillors nor interferes with their legitimate decisions to develop particular local area plans.  In order to ensure local area plans are comprehensively linked to the city or county development plan, which are reviewed every six years, their lifespan is being increased to 10 years under this Bill, although where a local area plan is no longer consistent with the city or county development plan because the development plan was reviewed or varied, there is a requirement to vary or review the local area plan within one year.There is also provision made for the phasing of development within a local area plan, as already provided for within a development plan, particularly given that zoning objectives are provided for in a local area plan on foot of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002.  Section 12 explicitly provides for the link between regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy.  Under this Bill, regional planning guidelines shall be set within the policy framework of the national spatial strategy, including its population targets which are updated from time to time.  Sections 13 to 16 strengthen the status of regional planning guidelines in relation to development plans and also strengthen the role of regional authorities in the preparation or variation of such plans.  Section 13 provides that a development plan must be consistent with the regional planning guidelines in force for the area to help achieve coherence between the hierarchy of forward plans.Regional authorities are, through sections 14 to 16, inclusive, given an explicit role in the pre-draft and the draft development plan preparation.  They are also given a role in regard to the variation of development plan.  The key aim is to ensure consistency and coherence between local planning and regional planning guidelines.Sections 14, 15 and 16 also set a broader perspective for the areas to be covered in the regional authority's observations report.  These can include co-ordinating development objectives across local authority boundaries and the strategic infrastructure requirements within a region to ensure regional priorities are being delivered.Section 17 provides that a planning authority must demonstrate, by way of a statement when preparing and making a draft development plan, how it has implemented the policies and objectives of the Minister contained in guidelines issued under section 28 of the principal Act.  Equally, as the case may be, planning authorities must detail the reasons such policies and objectives were not implemented.  This will bring much greater clarity into how key guidelines prepared at national level regarding, for example, sustainable expansion of small towns and villages or the development of wind farms in scenic areas, are being dealt with at local level.Section 18 deals with the complex and sometime controversial area of ministerial directions under section 31 of the Act.  The simple fact is that planning decisions at local level cannot fly in the face of wider regional and national interests, especially those agreed and endorsed by the Government.  For the sake of consistency, this Bill extends the ministerial powers to issue a direction to include local area plans, where many zoning decisions now are made by planning authorities.  This Bill also introduces new consultative arrangements for section 31 directions.  Once the Bill is enacted, and where the need arises to use these powers, a proposed or draft direction will be issued in the first instance to seek local views before any final direction is issued.  These new processes take full account of the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in its March 2009 report.Section 18 also provides for a discretionary provision for the Minister to appoint an independent inspector to review the manager's report prepared on foot of the public consultation on the proposed direction.  Section 20 proposes an amendment to section 35 of the Act, which will allow a planning authority to refuse permission where the applicant has carried out a substantial unauthorised development, including a development with no permission, or has been convicted of an offence under the planning Acts, subject to certain conditions.Section 21 amends the principal Act by providing for the extension of cost recovery to pre-application and scoping requests related to environmental impact assessment for strategic infrastructure development cases under the Seventh Schedule of the principal Act, in addition to cost recovery for cases that proceed to full application and determination by An Bord Pleanála.  The amendments in section 22 are designed to remove any legal impediment to e-planning.  The principal Act is amended to prescribe, for the avoidance of doubt, that a planning authority is authorised to display planning application documentation on its website.  I have encouraged planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to make greater use of information technology in processing planning applications and appeals.  This can enhance the level of service provided to users of the planning system, whether as applicants or as members of the public, and it can bring efficiency savings to planning authorities and statutory consultees.  My Department is such a consultee with regard to heritage issues and has developed pilot projects whereby planning applications can be referred to it electronically.Section 23 amends the principal Act to provide for the extension of permission, for a period of up to five years, in circumstances where substantial works have not been carried out but in which commercial, economic or technical considerations existed, beyond the control of the applicant, which substantially militated against either the commencement of the development or the carrying out of substantial works.  This section was amended on Report Stage in the Seanad to provide for the additional conditionally pertaining to the extension of such permissions.Section 28 amends the principal Act to empower An Bord Pleanála to reduce the quorum for its meetings from three to two members on the recommendation of the chairperson that such a reduction is necessary to ensure the efficient discharge of the business of the board.  This amendment, which has a number of built-in safeguards, aims to improve the throughput of An Bord Pleanála and to secure a higher compliance rate with the statutory objective period of 18 weeks for appeals.Section 29 provides for an increase in the maximum fine to €5,000 for a summary offence under the planning Acts and for an increase to €1,500 for the maximum daily fine for a continued offence.  Section 31 amends section 180 of the principal Act, which provides that a housing or residential estate would be taken in charge by the planning authority, in certain circumstances, on foot of a request from a majority of the owners or occupiers.  The Law Reform Commission report on multi-unit developments recommended that it should be owners of units only who would have the right to determine whether the estate is taken in charge.  This amendment implements the Law Reform Commission's recommendations.Sections 32 and 33 amend sections 182B and 182D of the principal Act, respectively, to provide powers for An Bord Pleanála to recover costs at pre-application and determination in respect of applications for electricity transmission lines and strategic gas infrastructure.  Section 35 modifies certain provisions of section 212 of the principal Act as they relate to the functions of the planning authority regarding the development of land.  This amendment is intended to extend the scope of the powers of planning authorities to allow them take action to secure the creation, management, restoration or preservation of any site of scientific or ecological interest.Section 37 was passed on Committee Stage in the Seanad and provides for the discounting of the Christmas holiday time period from any time limits in the development planning process.  This section reflects the current provisions that apply to time limits in the development management process.  Section 39 amends the First Schedule of the principal Act to provide for the inclusion in development plans of an objective for carrying out flood risk assessment as part of the control and regulation of development in areas at risk of flooding.  This is to ensure that appropriate flood risk assessment is fully integrated into the planning process.  To facilitate the provision of information to stakeholders on these new mechanisms for incorporating flood risk assessment into the planning process, as I mentioned earlier, my Department, in association with the Office of Public Works and following a comprehensive public consultation process, published guidelines for planning authorities on the planning system and flood risk management on Monday last.  These guidelines explain in detail how to assess and manage flood risk at all stages of the planning process.  The guidelines contain a commitment to a review of the exempted development provisions in the planning and development regulations, which currently allow for paving residential gardens to provide off-street car parking or hard landscaping.  The review will be conducted as part of the overall review of these regulations to follow enactment of the Bill.  The review will consider ways of ensuring that future exemptions will only apply where such developments comply with sustainable drainage principles.  A definition of "flood risk assessment" is also provided under section 3.Section 40 amends the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 to provide An Bord Pleanála with powers to recover pre-application and determination costs in respect of applications for railway orders.It is appropriate at this stage to signal some of the amendments I intend to introduce to this Bill on Committee Stage.  Building on the action I took last year to close the legal gap with regard to planning applications for retention permission for developments that should have been subject to environmental impact assessment, I also intend to bring forward specific provisions on Committee Stage that will remove the possibility of retention for unauthorised development which should have been subject to environmental impact assessment, other than in very exceptional circumstances.  In tandem with these amendments, I intend to revoke the current seven-year time limit within which enforcement action may be taken in respect of unauthorised development that should have been subject to environmental impact assessment.The European Court of Justice also has ruled against Ireland with regard to failure to implement and transpose adequately into Irish law elements of the birds and habitats directives.  It now has become necessary to integrate the requirements of these directives into Irish planning law.  There are two central issues that need to be addressed.  These are the screening and assessment of proposed land use plans and development proposals for their potential impact on European nature sites for the protection of birds and other species and habitats, collectively known as Natura 2000 sites, and measures to protect species of flora and fauna that are protected under Irish law from disturbance and destruction as a consequence of development.I am confident the proposed reforms to be introduced on Committee Stage will address the recent European Court of Justice judgments against Ireland in this regard.  I also intend to bring forward, by way of Committee Stage amendment, proposals to provide for the mandatory objectives in development plans for the protection and listing of undisputed rights of way and to provide for a legislative definition of "landscape" based on the definition of landscape set out in the European Landscape Convention.This Bill is about enabling us to better deliver competitive and dynamic cities, towns and regions which will help to improve our quality of life in economic, social and environmental terms.  It will contribute to the vision of a sustainable future for all and strengthen transparency, openness, democratic involvement and public participation in the planning system.  More focused land-use strategies will also result in more efficient use of taxpayers' money by allowing the State to target investment in essential infrastructure and services more accurately.I look forward to engaging in these provisions and in the Government's and Opposition's amendments which I hope will be constructive and helpful on Committee Stage.I commend this Bill to the House.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I can understand the context in which the Minister is making that assessment.The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 is a last gasp of a failed approach based on centralised planning obsessed with housing and settlement to the exclusion of positive planning for economic revival or sustaining communities.  It is about planning and development, yet often local authorities and Departments are consumed with only one aspect of it.  The Bill is illegal, illogical and indefensible.  It seeks to support a system of planning based on a national spatial strategy that is unsustainable, unaccountable and uneconomic.The Bill is an attempt to bolster a failed approach to planning by seeking to use the force of legislation where the force of argument has failed.  It addresses the very real issue of people in rural areas seeking to build houses for income instead of the urgent need to understand why they are seeking income from such sources in the first place, namely regional inequality.  This planning Bill wants to address the symptoms not the cause.The cause of what is worst in Irish planning lies in its overly centralised nature.  The command and control attitude of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government feels is based on the view that authorities are not to be trusted to determine their own future.  I am not surprised that a Green Party Minister adopted a centralised approach.  Deputy Gormley is the leader of a party that is now very much in tune with the wishes of Fianna Fáil whose members over the years have become masters in centralising authority.  The best example is the Health Service Executive.  Have we got a better service as a result?In this legislation, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is seeking to enshrine enormous powers of influence for any Minister of the day.  While the Minister has all the well-meaning objectives of good planning, his successors might not.  We have plenty of examples of past environment Ministers who subsequently became subject to intensive investigations in the Mahon and Flood tribunals.  The Minister is giving a dangerous precedent to his successors with the powers he will give them in this legislation.  On Committee Stage, will he examine how more controls can be placed on a future Minister who might lose the run of himself and undo some of the worthy objectives of the Bill?The Bill does nothing to address the lack of devolution which corrodes the effectiveness of planning, especially in regional rural economies.  Nor does it address the lack of integration between the planning of cities and counties.  Instead, it seeks to create a top-down system whereby unaccountable civil servants in Dublin can send out letters to dictate the population for every major town in the State.  This Bill seeks to fundamentally and finally secure this control by compelling the plans for every region, county, city, town and local area plan to conform to the national spatial strategy.Stalin would be proud to see such centralised planning is alive and well in Ireland.  How can the Minister claim this Bill improves accountability and local democracy when it seeks to strip local government of the last vestiges of its authority?  How can he claim to be ensuring balanced regional development while this Bill transfers back to the Department in Dublin all power to plan for the future of regions and rural areas?At the heart of the legislation is a proposal for a core strategy that will compel plans for every region, county, city, town and village to demonstrate they conform to the targets of the national spatial strategy.  These targets are being set by unelected and unaccountable departmental officials without reference to economic, environmental or demographic reality.  In the mad world envisioned by this Bill, every area will not only be forced to comply with a plan that has been unaccountably prepared, they will be forced to comply with a plan that is wrong.The economic reality is the majority of Ireland's tax revenue is generated in the east.  However, now when we are most desperately in need of national economic regeneration, we are asked to conform to a national spatial strategy that seeks to contain and control the nation's main economic engine — Dublin.  This is wrong.The environmental effects of the implementation of the national spatial strategy are unknown.  What will its effects be on air pollution, noise pollution, energy construction and road building?  What will be the effects of a strategy which proposes to create significantly more population in more widely dispersed places that lack adequate public transport while suppressing growth in the area with the highest concentration of high capacity public transport and the highest levels of public transport use?  We do not know.  What will be the effect on scenery, habitats, groundwaters and surface waters due to a strategy based on moving more population into the some of the country's most beautiful and fragile ecosystems?  Again, we do not know.  The national spatial strategy has never been discussed in the House or adopted by it.  It will be decided by the Minister and his officials in the Customs House.Basing our entire planning system on a strategy we do not know about is illegal, unwise and wrong.  A national spatial strategy that behaves like a misguided rural county councillor who believes that granting more houses will somehow magically make more people is deluded.  Settlement strategies do not make populations grow.  Yet this failed strategy, which the Bill will enforce using the core strategy provision, is solely based on settlement strategies.  How many circular letters does the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government send out about targets for jobs, facilitating rural enterprise or job creation?  Where are these targets?  Planning to grow based on settlement alone is wrong.The Bill is illegal because it seeks to create a framework for all planning decisions on the basis of a national spatial strategy that has not been subjected to a strategic environmental assessment, or appropriate assessment, as required by two separate EU directives.  The irony is the Department will strenuously insist that every plan subsequently based on the strategy must comply with these directives.  This is a gross illegality.The Bill is indefensible because it seeks to enforce settlement targets.  It treats personal decisions about where people will choose to live and rear their families as if they are boxes on shelves that can be re-arranged at the whim of an official in the Department.  The Minister will agree we live in a democracy.  His Green Paper on local government sought to bring about the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity.  However, since the June 2009 local elections he is moving away from that.The Bill's provisions, requiring all development plans to contain a core strategy in compliance with the national spatial strategy, which itself is demonstrably wrong, are a mistake.  All such provisions must be removed from the Bill because they are illegal, illogical and indefensible.The wonderful economist, the late Mr. Paul Tansey, used to bemoan that so few understood the difference between administration, the prudent use of public resources, and management, which is about making plans, having vision, taking risks and providing leadership.  It is important in times of financial crisis to understand the difference.  In such times, it is tempting to see the world solely in terms of the symptoms of a problem, which is essentially finances and figures.  Administration, which is the proper business of the public service, will never beat a path to the future.  The accountant is only put in charge when the company is in receivership.  Only dynamic leadership can tackle the root cause of today's problems and provide the growth, competitiveness and tax returns that will pay for social betterment.  Administration, by its very nature, cannot and will never deliver this.Irish public administration is one of Europe's most centralised.  Report after report from official bodies and commissions have pointed out how inefficient and damaging this is, in particular for peripheral and rural areas.  Genuine efforts to address this problem were made in the Barrington report 1991 and by the devolution commission in 1997.  However, vested interests, some political but mostly from within the public service, have prevented or diverted efforts at real change.  In times of stress, we all revert to familiar patterns of behaviour regardless of how destructive.  One of Ireland's worst habits is centralisation.  Evidence of this  reflexive behaviour when faced with stress can be seen in the McCarthy report proposals to abolish the Western Development Commission, Shannon Development, the regional authorities and 30% of local authorities.  The coming months will see many more proposals.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, got in on the act when he said we should abolish city and county councils.  All of these proposals which are put forward on the basis of lowering costs, creating greater efficiencies, will further remove from specialist agencies any control or accountability.What is it about centralisation that so excites those in power?  Centralisation offers the promise of effectiveness through greater oversight, efficiency and co-ordination.  While this sounds reasonable, to date centralised Departments have provided no effective oversight of children's welfare, the banks, the health system, export guarantee systems or any of the other scandals that have cost us hundreds of millions of euros in inquiries.  I do not believe that locally autonomous governance would be any worse.In practice, centralisation reduces the effectiveness and efficiency of public action and spending while at the same time suppressing local initiative, responsiveness and competitiveness.  For example, a new public marina in Connemara would require the involvement of at least four central Departments, namely, the Departments of Arts, Sport and Tourism, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Finance and that of local officials and agencies.  Every extra layer guarantees more delays, more administrative and compliance costs and less likelihood of meeting anybody with the narrowest of local needs.  On many levels, therefore, it is a poor use of resources.Irish people are often surprised to learn that throughout most of the European Union regional and local authorities collect local taxes.  They oversee and pay for a range of services which we have come to accept as the sole prerogative of centralised Departments and agencies.  Such authorities are usually responsible for services, including public transport, education, policing, energy, tourism and environmental protection.  This devolution of responsibility, from which the Minister is moving away, offers significant opportunities to plan and integrate the delivery and operation of these functions to ensure maximum use of all public spending and administration.  A locally controlled public bus can do school runs, hospital drop-offs for the elderly, local deliveries and support local tourism facilities and as such is responsive and responsible for local needs, which is good planning.Devolution is not decentralisation or relocation or the type of policies we have had during recent years dressed up as decentralisation which merely transfers the seat of a centralised authority to a regional location.  This is, at best naive and at worst cynical.  It does nothing to address the fundamental problems of an excessively centralised State, the size and cost of bloated and centralised Departments or their inflexibility, unresponsiveness or lack of accountability.What is the opposite of centralisation?  It is not every county for itself: that cannot be the case.  It is about co-ordinated competition and agreement and assignment of specialisations and roles according to the needs and strengths.  A one size fits all system will not work.  It is not about a Stalinist centralised plan for Ireland: it is about a mosaic of different and distinctive destinies, some large, some small.  Some regions have greater strengths than others.  Some locations will have an industrial future and others will have a future in tourism.  Some will have service sectors based on educational cultures and others will have a future based on science and finance.  While some will have all of these, others will have only a few.The McCarthy report merely treats the economic symptoms and is not a plan to tackle the root causes of our current problems.  A collection of cuts should not be mistaken for a plan.  Positive, proactive planning lies at the heart of good management.  Right now, Ireland needs a plan.  However, the only plan that appears to emerge is a reining in of power to an increasingly small number of more centralised institutions.Ireland's current model for economic growth which is principally based upon attracting mobile inward investment is now defunct.  We have lost our competitiveness and distinctiveness.  Many nations are now significantly cheaper, better regulated and more responsive than us.  We may never again be a low cost country.  Perhaps we do not want to be but we must plan for this.  We need a long-term plan based on capitalising on our many unique selling points, including the demographic, educational, technical and entrepreneurial skills we have developed.  A further entrenchment of the already  negative effects of excessive concentration would be damaging to this effort.There will always be a place for national planning in regard to national major infrastructural needs such as energy and transport.  We will also need centralisation in terms of fairness, equality and competitiveness.  A properly ordered State has layers of government, some central, some local to deal with the challenges locally and nationally.  In a properly ordered State, there is a clear and coherent division of roles which accord to two fundamental tenets, including how the EU interacts with member states.  The first is to have a clear and coherent hierarchy of where power is administered, the principle of subsidiarity.  It is rather ironic that we recently voted for this in the Lisbon referendum and are now seeking to again take centralised control and defy the principle of subsidiarity of which the people want more.We need positive planning, not a patch and fix of the McCarthy report nor the economic and social negativity of a national spatial strategy, of which we know little, to get us out of our mess.  We need a purposeful plan for Ireland to foster the island in all of its diversity, large and small, regional and local where every region is able to play to its strengths and exploit opportunities.The Minister has brought forward in the legislation a number of proposals which seek to confirm the tenet of centralised planning.  He mentioned the attendance of Carlow County Council SPC at a recent committee meeting on this legislation.  It is distressing to members of Carlow County Council that the implications of this legislation will be the building of 60 houses over a seven year period in places like Tullow, Rathvilly, Bagnelstown and the rural hinterlands.  I do not know if that information is correct.

This is the information that was sent to them from the Department.  Perhaps the Minister should check this out with his officials.  The population targets are set out in black and white in the circular issued by the Department.  I have every confidence in public officials to tell us the truth.  If the Minister says this information is wrong, then the director of services in Carlow County Council is wrong.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister whether he is correct.There is a herding mentality, given the information made available in this instance, which I hope is not replicated throughout the country.  An issue I would like the Minister to address is that of development contributions.  Perhaps the Minister will bring forward an amendment that will allow a local authority, at a time when it is hard to get money from development due, perhaps, to excessive charges that were imposed when times were better, to look at part of the scheme without actually reviewing the entire scheme and adopt more conciliatory pro-employment measures that would make a difference at this time.It was interesting recently to hear a rural chief planner explain to a local representative that the county development plan currently being prepared was not about facilitating the future of the county but mostly about protection of the landscape and the control of housing.  I do not know when a county development plan became about those sole objectives.  I always thought planning was not about maintenance of the present but planning for the future.  Planning, even in its ancient format, has been with us for a long time although it has only been regulated here since 1963.  We know the reasons the 1963 Act was necessary and why there have been amendments to the Act from time to time since then.  However, planning always retained the flexibility to allow local elected representatives and communities to have a say.  This legislation moves away from that.In the past few decades mapping has increasingly become confused with planning.  The instruments that are used to prepare for planning, such as the mapping of land uses, demographics and density, have become ends in themselves.  Such records are then converted to zoning maps that restrict future uses to those that conform with existing ones.  Each new provision of the planning Acts has also moved further away from any concern about the future, to become increasingly associated with forces that seek to limit, control or prevent development necessary to sustain economic or community activity.  It is unfortunate that planning is now often synonymous with blocking progress.  With tribunals, political corruption and prevention of development, planning has not moved far from former Deputy and Minister, Michael Smith's, 1993 description of planning as a debased currency, associated with bureaucracy, interference, administration, red tape, incomprehensible decisions and detachment from the very people for whom the plans are supposed to be created.More important than all this, however, is the fact that we are far more influenced by what happens outside Ireland than ever before and there is a greater obligation to respond to those outside influences.  European Union directives, CAP reform, the global economy and foreign direct investment are determining our planning for the future.  It is critical, therefore, to reflect on the role of planning in creating and sustaining what has become known as the housing bubble, which had little to do with increases in the cost or value of bricks and mortar and more to do with the value of the sites, which was solely the result of planning.  All market economies rise and fall on the back of supply and demand.  Land use planning determined the timely supply of available and appropriately zoned and serviced land.  Poor planning is a classic example of market failure.  It is surprising that planning has not yet been put on trial anywhere, along with the greed of speculators and the carelessness of banks, for being partly to blame for current upheavals in the property market.  It should be.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority, which has been the subject of much investigation by the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, offers a clear indication of how not to engage with an organisation that is a non-commercial State body.  It ensured the State sustained a loss of €213 million over a number of years.  It was led by banks and greedy developers rather than a proper master plan.We can plan for many things for the future and we must do so not by looking back to the past, but at the opportunities that Ireland might be able to address in the future.  There will be tough questions because we are competing with many other jurisdictions.  This legislation should be reconsidered.  It seeks to put everything together under the umbrella of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and to corral all local decision making to conform with the diktat of the Custom House.  That is totally at variance with so-called Government policy, as laid out in the Green Paper, on devolving power to local authorities.  The opportunities that planning offers to boost economic activity now are being straitjacketed through the Minister having the ultimate decision on every plan, local and county.  It is a micromanagement that is not healthy for democracy.  For those reasons, I urge the Minister to revisit the important issues in planning and development that are essential to giving people hope of living in a sustainable way in their communities, which we all support, and to providing employment opportunities so people can live and work in their own areas.  There are several examples of where that has not happened.The manner in which the Minister seeks to centralise everything is not the way to go.  For that reason I have grave reservations about the thrust of this policy and the damage it will do to the political system in the future, notwithstanding the Minister's bona fides in bringing forward the legislation.

However, the Green Party is a small part of the Government and the problem is the culture that has existed over the years in terms of Fianna Fáil's policy on development.  The Minister is possibly limited, therefore, in what he can do.  There are many welcome proposals in the Bill and I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will accept some of the Labour Party's suggestions to improve the Bill.I believe the Minister should be far more radical than he has been with this Bill.  Fianna Fáil, as the main Government party with the major influence, must look at what is happening now with planning, flooding and the many other issues we have to deal with in terms of our economic collapse and sustainability.  Before our economy went into recession we had increasing carbon emissions that we were unable to address properly.  I believe we are now on the brink of a state of emergency with regard to planning and flooding.  My suggestion, and I am sure the Minister can find the power to do it, is to impose a moratorium on rezoning for residential building for a period of time to allow the Government, local authorities, the Office of Public Works and the different agencies involved to take stock.  We have had a very bad experience this year and the situation has the potential to get worse as time passes.A large amount of land is already zoned for housing.  In Lucan in south County Dublin, there is probably enough zoned land to keep us going for decades.  In other areas there is also too much zoned land, even if it might be concentrated in particular counties.  The Minister said the flooding was caused by inappropriate and chronic rezoning, and he is correct.  There is much talk about the different factors that cause flooding.  People discuss climate change but there is no evidence to suggest that it caused the increased flooding of the past decade.  That said, climate change will be a factor and must be taken into account.The major factor in flooding is development.  The problem is not just that we are building on flood plains, but that we have been building too much too fast.  We need to take stock before going any further.  In my county council, there was a recent attempt to rezone a few hundred acres.  This would have been unsustainable and was against the manager's advice, but it would have been approved if not for some councillors stating that it made no sense.  Many landowners, councillors and people in the commercial, banking and political worlds are in denial about the situation.  They believe that we can revert to how we used to be and they will make a quick buck if more land is rezoned.  They are being unrealistic.While we state that the problem owes to building on flood plains, the issue is more complicated.  If one builds virtually anywhere, there will be a flood risk.  It is a question of what level of risk we can take and whether the necessary measures to deal with it can be put in place.  Most of us live in towns or cities that were built around rivers or on the coast.  There are many reasons to develop towns around rivers, but we have been building for a long time in areas at risk of flooding.  There can be no developments without some flood risk.  It is obvious that if one builds on green land, one will take up space where water would have gone.The Minister's mantra has been not to build on flood plains, but dealing with flooding is more complicated.  One must consider the level of risk prior to building.  If one decides to rezone land and build, one must manage the associated flood risk.  In some areas, a development's risk could be too high or implementing the necessary flood relief measures could be too costly.  They should not be rezoned and the Minister should have strong powers to ensure they are not.One might need to build a particular type of building, but certain buildings are not appropriate in some areas because of the attached flood risk.  However, other buildings could be suitable.  All of these factors must be considered.  It may need to be decided that key infrastructure should not be built in areas where the risk of flooding is high.  For example, we saw pictures of people travelling to hospital by boat.  We must consider whether such infrastructure should be built in certain places.Much of what I am discussing has been covered in the report of the flood policy review group, which was published in 2004.  The group involved stakeholders and operated under the auspices of the Office of Public Works.  The report was adopted as Government policy, but it has not trickled down into planning.The cumulative effect of rezoning and commercial and residential development must be examined.  There is no point in telling local authorities to consider the flood risk of building on certain lands.  One must view the bigger picture.  The cumulative effect is a major factor in the current flooding.  It is not just that we built where we should not have built, but that there was so much building so quickly.  In many areas, flood relief measures have not kept pace with the rate and quantity of development, creating more flood risks consequently.When the report of the review group was being drafted, 300 sites were identified as being at risk of flooding by taking into account historical flood patterns.  However, the resultant flood relief works programme takes no account of future flood risk, particularly in areas that have not been flooded previously.  Some of them have since flooded.  There are different reasons for not enough money being spent on the programme.  The Government has received reports on why the delivery of flood relief works has been so slow and one issue has been lack of manpower, which will become a greater problem if we start reducing public sector numbers.  Another factor is the need to streamline planning processes.  I do not know how that situation stands, as the Bill does not address it, but the planning of flood relief works should not take too long from the point at which works have been identified as being necessary to the delivery stage.The plans relate to the past and, while we must consider the future, we must get through the current programme of expenditure on flood relief works if we are to be able to identify new areas in need of flood relief works.  We are falling behind in this regard, which is one of the reasons there should be a moratorium on rezoning.  This would allow relief works to catch up with infrastructure and us to take stock of the current situation and what must be done.  Everyone involved in the process must be educated on this matter, as people involved in local councils do not seem to understand, not even in terms of the Minister's Bill, that this is a question of the bigger picture.  I agree with Deputy Hogan concerning centralised planning.  While I am for local power and local councillors having a role, this is a national issue, possibly a national emergency.  If we do nothing about it, it will worsen in the coming years.I looked through parts of the Bill.  I hope to be able to discuss them further with the Minister on Committee Stage.  He stated that one's objective during the drafting of a development plan should be to conduct a flood risk assessment.  I am unsure as to whether the word "objective" is strong enough.  I was a county councillor and objectives were vague things that were not often adhered to.  How strong would the flood risk assessment objective be?  Moreover, will these assessments relate to local areas only and not what is the situation down the road?  I live in Lucan and what is done in Leixlip can affect it and vice versa.  We must look across boundaries to manage flood risk.  The idea is to manage it in terms of river basins, as stated in the report of the flood review group, but the Bill has no provisions on river basin management.  Nothing in planning procedures ensures that local authorities co-operate when assessing flood risks.Development plans are drawn up in many local authorities.  I live in south County Dublin and was a member of South Dublin County Council, which is in the process of drafting a development plan.  For all I know, a councillor could propose to rezone a plot of land.  I hope that such does not occur, but it has been the case previously.  The Minister will not be able to do anything about it.  He should consider implementing a moratorium on rezonings for a set period to allow the Government to take stock, develop a strategic approach to the delivery of flood relief works, ensure legislation is sufficiently robust to stop bad rezoning decisions and ensure that local authorities look at the bigger picture and co-operate.  The Government should provide leadership in this issue.  This is my main point on the Bill, but it is a topical one.Reference is often made to people who live in communities that have a lack of infrastructure.  That is a big part of the history of Lucan, where I live.  Flooding was the worst thing to happen to people who bought houses and commercial premises in new areas of Lucan.  Flooding has a terrible impact on people's quality of life.  It is clear from recent events that it causes significant stress to people.  Older people do not want to leave their homes, even when water gathers around their houses at ground level.  A great deal of stress and difficulty is caused by flooding.  The prevention and management of flood risk should be a major part of our planning process from here on in.  The legislation proposed by the Minister is not strong enough.  He needs to review it.  We need a moratorium on rezoning for a set period so that we can all sing from the same hymn sheet and face up to the reality of what faces us in the future.The objectives of this legislation, like the planning guidelines, are quite weak.  The Bill states that councillors should "have regard to" the guidelines in place to help them when they make assessments and compile reports.  The significant rezoning powers of councillors are often used in a positive way.  People need houses in which to live.  I am in favour of sustainable development.  The measures being put in place by the Minister are not legally strong enough.  He needs a stronger legislative measure that will ensure councillors, planners and council officials are required to do certain things in their development plans.  I have spoken about the term "have regard to".  I understand the Minister is considering use of the term "in compliance with".  One can tell councillors and planning officials that their development plans must be "in compliance with" certain things, but it is a matter of interpretation.  Will the Minister overturn the decisions of councillors if they go ahead and rezone anyway?  While the Minister has done more overturning than his predecessors — he has asked councils to overturn decisions — he has not done it very often even though a great deal of bad planning has taken place.  I suggest that he should be given stronger powers to tie councillors to legislative provisions.  They should have to be "in compliance with" or "have regard to" such provisions.Sustainable planning, which is mentioned in the Bill, is very important.  When we use the term "sustainability", we are talking about the protection of the economy as well as the protection of the environment.  We messed up the economy by allowing unsustainable development to take place.  Sustainability is not just some environmental phrase that is used by An Taisce.  It is also of great economic importance.  I recommend that the Minister should consider the example of the strategic development zone model, as spelled out in our Planning and Development Acts.  When the strategic development zone plan for Adamstown, near Lucan, was being compiled, we found that the legislation was robust.  My fellow councillors and I did the things we were required to do.  Our actions were legally upheld when they were examined by An Bord Pleanála.  I suggest that in the future, we should adopt this model of tying things down in legislation.We need to do more about quality of design.  Many very badly designed buildings were built over recent years.  They look terrible on the landscape and they are not nice to live in.  Many rural villages have been ruined by the construction of apartment blocks that are totally out of keeping with the local area.  We should not allow huge supermarkets or shopping centres to be developed.  We should follow the example of countries like Germany and France by promoting small businesses, such as local bakeries and butchers.  The relevant stakeholders should be involved in these designs.Spatial strategy and regional guidelines should refer to river basin management.  The spatial strategy, which has been ignored, is totally out of date at this stage.  Will a load of development plans be adopted before the next spatial strategy and the next regional guidelines are drawn up?While I welcome the section 18 provisions, the Minister should make sure that social housing is developed in an integrated way, rather than having 500 such units in one place.  If we want more people to progress to third level education, for example, people from disadvantaged backgrounds should live in integrated areas.  If they go to school with their peers in the rest of the community, they will be interested in accompanying them to college.  That is a major aspect of this issue.I would like the Minister to explain the reference to "section 180 of the Principal Act".  Does it mean that people who live in developments that are managed by management companies can ask local authorities to take such developments in charge?  I would like exact clarification in this regard, as I do not think such a provision has ever before been used in the case of management companies.  Is this provision workable?
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I thank Deputy Tuffy for sharing time with me.  The issue I wish to raise — the maintenance of footpaths and private landings outside shops and businesses — does not directly relate to the subject of this Bill.  As I have been waiting for some time to draw attention to this issue, I will take the opportunity afforded to me by the Planning and Development Bill 2009 to do so.  I hope the Minister might consider the amendment I will propose in this respect on Committee Stage.  We are all familiar with the problems associated with the footpaths directly outside older shopping precincts and corner shops in our constituencies.  The immediate areas outside shops and businesses, which are referred to as private landings, are often used for display or delivery purposes.  All of us have received complaints from constituents about dangerous footpaths and roadways that pose a risk to public safety.  When we ask the local authority to take action to repair a footpath or fill in a pothole on a roadway, we often discover that the local authority is not responsible for the areas in question because it does not own them, or has not taken them in charge.  A number of problems arise because local authorities have no role in the maintenance of such privately owned areas.I am sure other Members of the House are familiar with the frustration one feels when one encounters this problem and learns that one cannot deal with it in an effective way.  Obviously, it leads to an increase in the number of dangerous footpaths that are not maintained.  If something is not done about the law in this area, they will never be fixed.  It seems that local authorities have virtually no control over these problems.  When they had a few bob, they were quite proactive in improving the appearance of areas in the interests of public safety.  However, it is quite common for there to be several dangerous stretches of footpath or roadway in any given area.  The relevant local authority is hampered in its work because it has no role in ensuring such areas are adequately maintained.  It is also problematic that these areas give rise to trips and falls.  Over recent years, five or six people have fallen and injured themselves on a footpath outside a pub in my constituency.  The cases in question are backed up in the courts.  People who had an accident along this stretch five years ago have not yet received redress, while other people continue to fall into the same pothole.  No action is being taken because the law is so weak in this area.The normal parking rules cannot be enforced in these cases.  They do not apply in the areas to which I refer because they are not public roadways or footpaths.  Interestingly, when I looked for the Garda to take action with regard to speeding and parking in one of these stretches I discovered the rules of the road do not apply there.  Normal speeding and parking legislation does not apply to these areas because they are not public roadways.  Apart from that, these areas can be eyesores and very much militate against local residents who are trying to improve the appearance of the area.  Some businesses may be interested in doing that also but their colleagues do not co-operate.I ask the Minister to consider introducing legislation to tackle this problem.  There is general agreement that this area needs attention and local authorities need to have a role in it.  That requires legislation.  In my own constituency I have gone into detail trying to research some of these areas to see what exactly was the problem.  I discovered that in some cases these areas are owned by the business owners and in other cases are owned by people who may or may not still be alive.  Such people may have formed part of a trust fund, or whatever, going back many years.  In many cases there is a real difficulty in identifying who is the actual owner.I shall table an amendment to the following effect but I ask the Minister to consider paying attention to this matter and allow for local authorities to require owners to maintain these areas to an acceptable standard.  If they are not prepared to do that I ask the Minister to consider giving local authorities the power to impose fines.  There is no doubt there are negligent owners of these areas, among whom, I suggest, are some who do not realise they are the owners.  There may have been a deed of trust or some other event that took place many years ago and the owners may not realise they own these places.  There should be a power to impose a fine if owners fail to protect these areas.  After all, these are public areas but are not publicly owned.  They are used by the public and a public safety issue is involved.  Somebody must ensure public safety is not compromised.It is important in cases where local authorities cannot identify the owner, or where endless trouble would be entailed in identifying the owner or making contact with him or her, that local authorities should be given the power to carry out repairs and take these areas into public ownership, taking charge of them on a compulsory basis.  That is essential.  This may seem to be a small issue but when one thinks about it, it is not so.I am sure this issue will resonate with many other Members of this House. Throughout our constituencies there are areas that are dangerous, that pose a risk to older people or those who are not perhaps as mobile as the rest of us.  People should not be exposed to such risk.  There are ways of dealing with it, straightforward ways of tackling this problem effectively which would not be too complicated from a legislative point of view.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to that.

This is a most important debate and I am delighted to welcome this legislation.  It should have been put in place many years ago because we are now reaping the rewards — probably the wrong word — or the pain of poor planning over many years.  All of us in the House have experience of bad planning, particularly those of us who came through the local authority system which has ravaged many of our cities, towns and small villages.  Coming up to the Dáil this week, I took a photograph of a flood plain which had a planning application and outline planning permission for three sites.  The water from the River Barrow was 100 yards away but the flood water had come right up to the road.  I have this on my mobile telephone if the Acting Chairman would like to look at it.

These development plans and the housing strategy must now be consistent with regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy.  That is good.Some Opposition politicians have decried this legislation and I am sorry that Deputy Hogan has left the Chamber.  In my presence he described this as "social engineering at its worst".  This was with regard to local area plans.  I would like to query Deputy Hogan on that and find out where he is coming from with this kind of logic.

It is certainly not the Minister's intention to have an assault on local democracy.  He wants to give more powers to local authorities and reform local government to ensure we have good sustainable planning.  I do not think anybody in local government should fear this legislation if planning is sound and sustainable.  Ireland is a small country and one in which there must be a regional and national co-ordination of planning.  We cannot plan our towns and villages without considering population projections and dove-tailing county development plans and without having knowledge of the national infrastructural projects so that the provision of services would be linked to density of population.Across the country, bad planning has been responsible for satellite towns springing up all over the place.  One newspaper published a supplement that showed all the flooding around the country.  One could see from the aerial photographs the madness of some planning.  Some of the estates had names such as "Waterside" and "Bog Road".  That was for obvious reasons.  We should not be building houses in those places.  Now these unfortunate people are suffering because of bad planning.  This new Bill will put a stop to that.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	529	The names are better than "Dallas Park".  Local names should be used.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I will be very interested to hear Deputy Bannon's contribution.  We must look at how we do our planning and plan our towns.  A place is not a home for a child if the child cannot go to school nearby or play sport in the locality, if all time is spent being taxied around by parents because the local infrastructure is not there.  That is not what memories of childhood should be.  When we are planning our towns and villages, we should put in the infrastructure.An important component of this Bill is the new ministerial guidelines which will examine local planning.  This is to be welcomed.  In a local area plan in the Carlow town area, there were 2,500 objections to rezoning because the people in that area thought it was fantasy planning.  Unfortunately, the plan went ahead but perhaps because of the recession we are now dealing with some of that crazy rezoning will now not go ahead.I am delighted that local area plans will have to tie in with regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy.  We all know that local area plans have been used often as the back door for dodgy rezonings.  I remain confident that localities can be given the necessary planning despite the raising of the threshold to a population of 5,000 because county development plans will make the provisions for economic planning and ensure we have a good spread of housing and development in our towns and counties.Unless we do this it will be too late.  Now there is a chance that for the future we will have sustainable planning and towns and villages we can be proud of, not lovely villages with local vernacular architecture and, beside them, 150 brand-new houses that are completely out of character with the architecture and are not in keeping with the local towns and villages.  As we all know from those who drop leaflets into them, many of those houses are empty.  The only things that flutter in their letter-boxes are advertisements for supermarkets and cheap services people are trying to offer others because they are down on their luck due to the recession.What will happen to all those empty houses?  Planning will have to be examined.  The Minister stated that where over-rezoning has taken place he will have the power to de-zone.  If, as the Construction Industry Federation tells us, there are thousands of unoccupied houses in Ireland — the figure ranges from 50,000 to some hundreds of thousand — why are some county councillors now getting into a tizzy about this new Bill which will provide them with proper planning?  It will not bring down the wrath of An Bord Pleanála or the Minister.This Bill makes good sense for the future development of our country.  The Minister said that many councils may be asked to de-zone in coming years to take account of the developer-led rezoning which occurred during the boom years.  I hope we see this happen as it will help to prevent the rise of another crazy property boom.  The amount of housing provided by some county councils, which made provision for many thousands of houses more than were necessary and for many decades, fuelled speculation and ill-advised property investment, which have led to so many problems.  We only have to look to Monaghan for an example.We all want to mend our ways and ensure that our planning can stand up to scrutiny.  We should spare no effort in condemning councillors who want to assist developers and landowners against efforts to dezone.  We need to ensure that we leave our murky ways behind us.  Developer-led rezoning should be a thing of the past.  When this Bill comes into force, one of our good legacies will be that we will not have developer-led planning but sustainable, well-thought-out planning that will enhance towns and villages and of which we can be absolutely proud.People are saying flooding of the kind we just witnessed occurs only once in 800 years but many people, including Professor John Sweeney, an expert on climate change, stated that such floods will occur more frequently.  Therefore, we must ensure that the appropriate infrastructure is in place to protect towns and villages.

I am surprised the Green Party did not use all its time on this very important Bill.Consider the quotation: "It is often forgotten that people are also the first victims of bad planning."  These words are not mine but were spoken by the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, when he introduced this Bill in the Seanad.  These are words I am sure came back to haunt him over the past week.  So well they might.  So many people, houses, farms and businesses are victims of the Government's mismanagement.  Having shamefully refused to draw up planning regulations to prevent the building of houses on flood plains, what can the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, or the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, do for or say to those who have lost everything?  I have witnessed the dreadful losses people incurred on foot of the recent flooding.  All the Minister does is blame the problem on bad planning.  He should remember this Government has been  in situ for the past 20 years.In his contribution in the Seanad, the Minister referred to the lessons being learned and the legacy we have inherited from development plans in recent years.  That is certainly a lesson hard learned.  The Minister's policies have forced people to build on lowlands and flood plains rather than prime sites on their own farms, as was the traditional safeguard against flooding.I live in the midlands in a house that was built in the 18th century on an elevated site.  It would be a good exercise for the Government, including the Minister, to ascertain the number of recently flooded houses that were built prior to the issuing of the 1963 planning and development regulations.Over-development with no consideration given to outlets for flood water and the granting of planning permission to speculators to build on every square inch of land without leaving green areas have caused water traps for unsuspecting purchasers.  I highlighted time and again as a member of the local authority that we need to provide more green areas in housing developments.  I am aware of cases in Longford, Westmeath and many other areas throughout the country where drains were closed and homes were built on the sites.  This was wrong.  Drains and small rivers to allow for the movement of water were closed up by greedy developers and planners.  This happened nationally.Lessons must be learned from the property boom.  Ill-thought-out and unsustainable policies, with an eye not to the needs of buyers but to taxes such as capital gains tax, stamp duty and development levies, ought to be policies of the past.  Over-development in the interest of developers, speculators and the Government, which has led to the awful sight of "ghost estates" throughout the country, particularly in the midlands because of the tax incentive scheme, which should have ceased years ago had the Government had any cop-on, must be legislated against strongly.  There were crazy schemes in place allowing speculators from the capital to go down the country and build houses that were not even needed just because there was a tax incentive for doing so.We must consider the role of An Bord Pleanála and the lack of transparency that has dogged its decisions.  I recently raised the difficulty in obtaining a reply from the board to my representations or queries.  They were ignored and never responded to.  I raised this at a committee when we had personnel from An Bord Pleanála present, including the chairman, to discuss its annual report.As I have said in the House on many occasions, it is a crying shame that young people are forced into substandard accommodation in local towns rather than being allowed to build on their family land.  It is extraordinary that builders and speculators have been allowed to build on flood plains and every other inch of land they could find while rural families' building traditions have been overturned by the planning authorities.For too long, rural Ireland has been at the mercy of a system that displays an anti-countryside bias, resulting in the sons and daughters of country people who have lived for generations in one area being forced off the land into urban areas.  I am sure Deputy Mary Alexandra White is aware this occurs in County Carlow, just as I am aware of its occurrence in counties Longford and Westmeath.An Bord Pleanála must be accountable to the people because bad planning decisions are having an adverse impact on their lives.  Unjust and untenable planning decisions are resulting in social problems and unfinished estates.  I pity people who are forced to rear families in conditions of extreme anti-social behaviour caused by the failure of planners to ensure adequate infrastructure, transport, leisure facilities, schools and child care facilities are in place in residential areas.  Any other country in Europe has a better planning system in place than that in Ireland because in such countries there is an obligation on the developer to install the infrastructure first and then build housing or apartment units.Despite the havoc they can cause to the lives of people, planners are currently unaccountable for their decisions regarding rural towns and villages. Some 1.8 million people live in the countryside and they need proper representation.  Where is the balance in An Bord Pleanála in regard to rural-based people which was promised by the Government?  We were promised that people with a background in the rural way of life would be involved with it, but that has not been provided despite numerous representations to the Minister to ensure it would happen.  Legislation passed more than 30 years ago provided for representation from rural areas.  I regret that has not yet happened.  I would appreciate if Deputy Mary Alexandra White would request that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, ensure there is rural representation on the board of An Bord Pleanála.Currently the ethos of most planners is towards urbanisation and an anti-rural housing bias exists when assessing individual applicants.  Radical change is needed to bring about positive planning for rural areas.  It is scandalous that 49% of all planning reports carried out in Ireland up until recently were by part-time planners based in the UK who had no recognition of the Irish position and our unique historical and cultural traditions.  While these planners might have had qualifications from the Royal Town Planning Institute in London, they should have to study courses on how Ireland operates.  They had no idea of the Irish dimension before taking up employment in this country, something with which I was very disappointed.  We urgently need regulation of the planning sector and personnel in line with other professions such as teaching or nursing, with qualified planners being registered by Irish authorities and bodies as a requirement of practice.There is one area of Government policy that I particularly want discuss, which while not directly related to planning is by extension relevant to this issue, namely, the new annual charge of €200 on second homes, which was payable by 31 October 2009 and will now have to be paid again early in the New Year.  It is an absolute disgrace.  The imposition of the charge was another stealth tax and difficult to justify.  What possible justice is there in setting a rate for a 12-month period and then obliging taxpayers to pay it again three months later?The issue emerged at a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, of which I am a member.  Why were taxpayers not informed of this dubious practice?  The Minister of State should ask the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to rescind this decision and allow all those who paid the tax to get a full 12 months out of it.  This is simply a rip-off by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party which once again fleeces taxpayers.I have been made aware of a person in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath who owns only one house but is forced to rent a room in Dublin during the winter months at a cost of €600 per month to ensure access to her employment.  She is shamefully being charged the €200 tax on her one and only home.  This is wrong and unfair.  When the tax was introduced we were told it would be a tax on a second home, but the person to which I referred has only one home and is still obliged to pay the tax.This country has gone mad regarding development plans.  We have county development plans, regional development plans for counties and towns, town area plans, district plans and BMW regional plans, to name but a few. There is all planning and no action, which is part of this Government's report mountain which leads us nowhere.  There is a huge lack of consistency between one county and the next.  Much of the current planning policy must be blamed for the decline in rural schools and closure of rural post offices, shops and other services.

This discussion is timely, in particular when there is so much discussion in the media and on the airwaves about flooding and bad planning.  Ministers who visited various constituencies blamed bad planning for causing the flooding.  The reality is that people were also beginning to blame bad planning for the flooding.I am not an expert but I live in a constituency which has many rivers and waterways, including those close to where I live.  Without fear of contradiction, the cause of the flooding in this country is the silt and filth left in the bottom of the rivers which has been allowed to accumulate over a long period of time.  No matter how one examines the issue, if the rivers and drains were cleared we would not have had the type of flooding we have experienced. No-one can prevent, stop or blame the Government for the rain.  However, it can take responsibility for the lack of drainage throughout the country.I understand the Green Party has an interest in this issue because it has often said flooding is caused by various issues.  The Government should develop a comprehensive drainage programme to alleviate the major hardship which was caused to many people in towns and villages across the country.  If such a scheme were put in place, we would then be able to deal with the many issues which surround planning. There is no doubt many bad planning decisions have been made in the past.  Decisions were made which would now not be made.  Panels have made decisions they probably regret.I am very concerned about the thrust of the Bill, namely, that it takes away power in terms of local knowledge from local people.  That is a fundamental problem I have with the Bill.  There is nobody who is better able to deal with local knowledge than local councillors.  This Bill lacks a provision that would allow councillors have an input into local decisions.  In recent years we have relied on An Bord Pleanála to make decisions in this regard.  Who comprises its board?  It is appointed by the Minister and comprises specialists who live in Dublin, miles away from the problems of rural Ireland, who sit in judgment of the planning decisions which go before it.  Instead of passing this Bill we should give extra powers to local government members to have an across-the-board say in planning issues.Area development plans are essential to many villages throughout the country.  If we had a system in place with restrictions on the amount of land they can zone and planning permissions they can give with their local knowledge and input, we would have considerably fewer bad decisions.  I challenge the Government on this matter.  It is taking the democratic decisions.  Whether the Government likes it or not, we are living in a democracy.  We all want democracy.  Democratic decisions are made for and on behalf of the people.  That is what the Government is about and that is what we should be doing.  If we want to see local government developed and strengthened, planning needs to be a responsibility of the local representatives who have the knowledge.I recently met a man in my locality who sensibly told me that the maps used by An Bord Pleanála and the local authority are the wrong maps because they do not highlight the flood plains.  The small 6-inch old-style maps that were in use many years ago point out every single area where flooding might take place.  That is a major difficulty that has found its way into the present system.  If the local representatives were able to use their knowledge, they would be able to install the sewerage schemes that are badly needed in almost very village in the country.  For example, in my village of Golden, County Tipperary, for the past 20 years raw sewage has flowed from a pipe into the River Suir in one of the most beautiful and scenic parts of the country.  That has been allowed to happen because we depend on central Government for funding to put that in place.Most important local government decisions take place at a central level, including those taken by An Bord Pleanála.  We need to bring back that power to the people and allow people who are proud of their areas to draw up the plan that would put in all the facilities, the sewerage schemes, the plans for the schools and the number of houses that need to be built.  Experience is a good thing.  These people can learn from their past experiences.  We all like to develop the country and make it a better place in which people can live, work and educate their children.  We all know the rural areas in which we live.Certain parties in government have spoken out against rural housing policies.  Whatever we do into the future the one-off rural house and the housing of families in rural areas needs to be protected.  It is unfair for any party in government to put a stop to that.  One of the finest qualities of life is to be had in rural areas of Ireland with fresh air, nice people, good road structure, etc.  People want to live in rural areas.  The Government, An Bord Pleanála or anybody else should not stand in the way of allowing people to live in the houses they want in such rural areas.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I wish to deal with a number of issues in the legislation, which I am very happy to see introduced at this stage.  The key features of the legislation are the introduction of a requirement for an evidence-based system to ensure greater coherence between county development plans, the housing strategy with the regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy.  I shall return to that point shortly.  The Bill provides for more synergies between these various plans, including local area plans, particularly in so far as zoning of land is concerned.  I support the provisions changing the rules for the making or variation of a development plan or local area plan, which will require the support of two thirds of the total number of members of the planning authority instead of a simple majority at present.  The Bill provides that only minor amendments will be permitted to draft development plans or local area plans which have been the subject of public consultation.Ministerial guidelines will have greater legal force and I will deal with that in greater detail.  I am Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which completed a detailed report on the matter.  It has been quoted extensively and it has contributed to an improvement in this legislation as a result of the recommendations that I, as Chairman of the committee, would have brought forward with the committee some time ago, especially following the issue with the Mayo county development plan.  A section of the Bill strengthens the powers of local authorities to refuse planning permission to applicants who have been convicted of serious breaches of planning legislation.  Improvements will be made to effectiveness, including the use of e-planning.  Local authorities will have greater flexibility regarding the distribution of existing development levies.The legislation essentially boils down to the one issue of greater synergies between the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines, county development plans and local area plans.  While I support the general principle, I wish to highlight a number of issues of particular concern in that regard.  I am about to make a controversial statement.  At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government representatives of An Bord Pleanála brought to our attention that there are approximately 88 planning authorities, between city councils, county councils and urban councils, which is wrong.  It is far too many.  Many of the counties should have only one.  Some urban councils within modestly sized counties are individual planning authorities in their own right.  It is impossible for the senior planners in those areas to have the breadth of experience necessary to deal with a complicated planning application if it happened to come their way.  Given the limited number of planning applications that go through some planning authorities, some of them may never have any cases going to An Bord Pleanála and so are not gaining benefit from the interaction of having some of their cases being reviewed and adjudicated by an inspector from An Bord Pleanála and, ultimately, a judgment from the board.The An Bord Pleanála annual report produced the figures for appeals on a county-by-county basis.  It has promised to supply information in respect of each planning authority.  I was shocked to hear there were 88, which is wrong from a planning point of view.  It results in too much fragmentation and it would not be possible to have the required skills base.  It is wrong for the urban council of a town of 10,000 people to be a planning authority.  An area should have a minimum population of 20,000 to 30,000 before justifying a planning authority.  While I know some people will disagree with me, I believe it would lead to more coherence.Most of the Bill's provisions hinge on the national spatial strategy.  As a Deputy representing the Laois-Offaly constituency and primarily representing County Laois, I have a fundamental problem with the national spatial strategy.  County Laois hardly featured in that document.  I believe it made its way into one half-sentence in the entire book.  I made a submission when it was being prepared in 2000-01.  The national spatial strategy is seriously out of date.  It was published in 2002, long before the economic boom or major increases in population.  The Ireland of today is fundamentally different from when the strategy was drafted almost ten years ago.  It now needs to be reconsidered.  Some areas were not adequately dealt with.I recall the submission I made at that time.  I live in County Laois, which is part of the greater Leinster area, less than 50 miles from Dublin.  All development in such areas — Kildare, Carlow, Wicklow, Meath, Louth or Laois — is related to the greater Dublin area.  Many people in Laois commute to Dublin every day and many people from Dublin have come to live in Laois.  I asked that we be included in the eastern midlands area or be more integrated with the east coast, but when the national spatial strategy was issued we were lumped in with Longford, Westmeath and Offaly.  They are lovely counties, but there is zero synergy between Counties Laois and Longford.  Nobody commutes or travels to shop from the Longford-Westmeath area to County Laois or vice versa.  It makes no sense that we are tied into this area under the national spatial strategy.  There are probably historical links through health boards or something similar.  However, Laois, as a county, has much more affinity and synergy with the counties to the east of it, such as Kildare, Carlow and Dublin.The national spatial strategy needs to be re-examined because it is now almost ten years out of date.  I would like to see the Minister comment on this at some stage during the passage of the legislation.  Regional guidelines should not be formed from a national spatial strategy that is out of date.One of the problems with the national spatial strategy was that it was an attempt at social engineering.  There is such a thing as economic gravity.  People in Laois gravitate to Dublin, but the national spatial strategy said we should gravitate to Lanesborough in Longford.  It does not make sense.  It was an attempt to keep populations in certain areas and reduce the expansion of the greater Dublin area.  However, if we know anything about world populations it is that they tend to gravitate towards the major population centres.  This is the case in Leinster, but the same applies in Munster; people from outside the cities gravitate to Cork or Limerick.  To try to create a gravitational pull towards an artificially created region makes no sense and it should not be the basis for regional planning guidelines in the future.Laois is also part of the BMW region.  There is zero synergy between Laois and Donegal, Mayo or Monaghan.  We should not be in the BMW region; it makes no logical sense.  It was set up to help draw down funding from the EU for a particular purpose several years ago.  That is the only reason that region exists and I do not see any practical benefit from it.  Such things should be reconsidered.I mentioned earlier the issue of ministerial directions.  There is a special section in the Bill changing the way these are handled when an amendment or variation to a county development plan is sought.  The Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government had a meeting with representatives of Mayo County Council who were not happy with the procedures that were carried out with regard to their county development plan.  This also happened in my county in 2006 when there was an element of over-zoning by local council members.  Local councillors are not the best people to decide on zoning of local land.  When a request comes in to a local authority about zoning of land, many councillors, if they are honest, will admit that they first ask whose land it is rather than where it is or what it will be used for.  Most Deputies here who have been members of local authorities will know this question is asked by local councillors every day and is an influence on their decisions.I said at a conference more than a year ago that there must be some new mechanism for zoning land whereby a simple majority is insufficient.  I proposed a double-lock mechanism under which the county manager and the majority of members would have to agree.  What is being proposed here is that there must be a two-thirds majority for rezoning decisions, which is good because it means the party that controls the council by a simple majority cannot make such decisions unilaterally and, in some cases, in spite of professional advice to the contrary.  I am not saying professionals are always right, but neither is it right that such decisions can be made by a simple majority.  The proposed system is more democratic and gives a say to a greater number of people.  I consider it an enhancement of local democracy, which needs to be pursued.What the committee stated in its report, which has been made available to Deputies here, is that the problem is that under the current law, if a Minister is not happy with a completed development plan, the next step is a directive, out of the blue, to the local authority, with no consultation or discussion.  We made a recommendation that there should be a consultation period and the Minister should first issue a draft directive, obtaining submissions from the local authority and other interested parties.  The Minister should have an absolute right in legislation, as a representative of the national Parliament — because we are a relatively small country — to force local authorities to make changes to their county development plans.  However, under the existing legislation the process is weak and faulty.  I am pleased the Minister has considered the recommendations of the joint committee in that regard.  Our meeting with the Mayo councillors was attended by about 35 Members of the Oireachtas, which shows that the issue has exercised the minds of many people.  This represents an improvement of procedures that are not adequate under the existing legislation.The issue of housing strategies is pertinent to this legislation and was mentioned by previous speakers.  I ask the Minister, for Committee and Report Stages, to reconsider such issues.  The majority of local authorities were not committed to the concept of a housing strategy and asked consultants to prepare reports.  The only outcome in which the local authority was interested was what percentage of Part V houses it would get from particular developers for affordable or social housing.  The concentration of housing strategies in most counties is geared towards waiting lists for council houses.  In most counties or cities local authority housing represents about 5% of the total housing stock — certainly not as much as 10%.  In most housing strategies the local authority's housing needs had an undue influence and the vast array of private houses being provided were not considered.I would like to see an amendment to the Bill dealing with affordable housing.  There is a serious problem in this area.  The people who dreamt up the concept of affordable housing had an excellent idea, but they only considered it on the basis of prices rising; they never considered that prices could fall.  The legislation in this area states that the price paid by a local authority for an affordable house is the actual cost of construction plus a profit margin for the builder, which can be up to 15%.  In my local authority the price being paid on this basis is more than the market value.  Affordable houses, believe it or not, are on sale in County Laois for €150,000 but the market value for better houses in a neighbouring estate is about €125,000.We are in the perverse situation, because of falling prices, that affordable houses are costing local authorities more than their open market value.  It was never considered that prices would drop.  I have heard this from builders and they are laughing.  They say they are being paid more than the market value for these houses, but if the housing officer has a problem with what they are saying they will win because the legislation states that the price should be the cost of building plus a margin for profit.  House values have fallen below the sum of cost plus profit; many houses are being sold for less than this.  That is something that has come to pass in recent times and the legislation should deal with it by changing the formula for pricing.There has been much mention of planning and the planners.  It is easy to dump on An Bord Pleanála, but I am always a great believer in bodies like An Bord Pleanála and the Office of the Ombudsman because I do not believe that front-line staff, whether in social welfare, housing, the tax office, the HSE or planning offices, should have the ultimate say on anything.  There always must be a court of appeal like An Bord Pleanála.  We may not always like what An Bord Pleanála does but we would be in a fair worse situation if we did not have it in operation.The problem with many of the house designs, which is a big issue in rural areas, is that practically all of the planners who are on the front line making decisions across the country have been trained in the UK.  Many of them are Irish, but they went to the UK and most of them got their training over there.  They have a UK urban-orientated mind-set on proper planning.  The Department is continually having to send out manuals about rural housing and such issues.On rural housing, I was born and reared, and have lived all my life, in a rural area in County Laois.  I do not live in a town and I am all in favour of that.  The main reason we have a problem with so many people wanting to build individual houses in rural areas is because the Government consistently over the decades refused to provide funding for waste water sewerage schemes in the villages and small towns.  There are at least 12 villages without a sewerage scheme in County Laois.  It is impossible for anybody to get planning permission in one of those village because one needs sufficient area coverage for percolation and the only option is to buy a field from a farmer out the road, leading to ribbon development.  The principle reason we have had so much one-off rural housing is that we were not providing the ability to build houses in villages.  What happened in every village during the boom was that if a developer built 100 houses, he would put in a sewerage scheme.  It was the only way some villages ever got such a scheme in the past ten years.My single biggest criticism of Governments over the past generation has been their refusal to provide adequate funding for waste water.  Much money has been allocated to provided public water supplies and we can even see that the grant for a water scheme for a group of houses is substantial — I am not sure whether it is €6,000 or €8,000.  There is on paper a grant for individual sewerage schemes, but it does not get drawn down often because it is so complex to do so.  In addition, there are many towns where people cannot get planning permission at present because the sewerage systems are at full capacity.Deputy Bannon stated he could speak all night, but I will not do so.  Most Deputies have a keen interest in this area.  I am pleased with the provisions in the Bill dealing with the taking charge of estates, especially where the majority of people in an area want that done.  There is also provision in this legislation to deal with situations where there is a majority of multi-unit owners.  This follows the recommendation from the Law Reform Commission on the taking in charge of those areas.I am pleased with the issue of e-planning.  When a person gets a receipt from a local authority or An Bord Pleanála he or she should be able to accept a copy of that receipt by electronic means.  The board refuses many applications because the person cannot produce the individual receipt.The European Court of Justice made decisions as a result of the Lemybrien case it dealt with last year where it stated that if an environmental impact assessment was required in relation to retention of a particular development, no planning could ever be granted because one could not do an assessment.  This would be because the scheme, or what had happened so far, was so big one could never assess what was the original environmental situation for the purpose of drawing up a proper EIA.  This applies to a few quarries and sandpits around the country which have been caught in this quango situation.  I hope the Minister will bring forward transitional recommendations on Committee Stage to deal with those developments caught temporarily in this situation.As Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I look forward to the Bill coming before us in due course and to it passing through the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.

His contribution was coloured by his upbringing in Laois and by living in a small rural area.  As a member of Cork City Council for nine years and also dealing with Cork County Council, I suppose I bring much of that experience to bear on this debate.  The breadth of issues with which I would be dealing stretch from rural scenic areas to urban areas.Interestingly, in Cork City Council's housing strategy, 20% of housing would be social and affordable housing.  It is a demanding issue for members of the council and for the housing authority, particularly when one considers that the city has quite a small area and there is a high demand for housing, as there is in all cities because people naturally gravitate towards the services.I welcome much of this Bill.  It is important that it ties in the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines to the development plans and, in turn, to the local area plans.  The network has always been there but it is important that adherence to the various guidelines would be reflected right through to the development plan.As a member of Cork City Council, I was involved in making a number of development plans.  They are demanding.  The local representatives have a substantial input.  They are the people living in the area who can bring the needs of the communities to the table.  I would never reject or ignore that input.  It is extremely important and should always be protected.  It is the essence of our democratic system.However, in my experience there is a case to be made for supporting councillors in their work, particularly when they are dealing with the development plan, by providing independent planning advice to councillors.  The councillors are presented with the development plan by the planners and the management of the local authority and councillors should be given independent support in putting forward their views.The development plans in which I was involved reflected national planning guidelines.  I do not think I was ever involved in a rezoning motion — maybe I was fortunate that there was not much land to be rezoned.  It is important that rezoning should be taken seriously.  I am inclined to agree with the proposal that no rezoning should be implemented unless it has the support of two thirds of the council.  It is difficult to get two thirds of a council to vote in favour of a motion.  To get such an outcome would deserve much attention and persuasion on behalf of those who proposed the motion.  It is a good development.  Others, probably even those in my party who have spoken, would not agree with that, but planning is so important in how we develop our areas that such motions should be put to the test and the bar should be set high in any changes that any local authority or local member should propose to make.The national spatial strategy is in place.  The debate here is about councillors trying to overturn decisions locally but on the other hand, there was the decentralisation proposal in a recent budget which paid no attention to spatial planning or national development plans.  Under the decentralisation programme, Government bodies and Departments were allocated to areas that did not reflect the objectives of the national spatial strategy.The national spatial strategy has been spread too thin.  As a small island with a small population we cannot develop hubs and gateways everywhere at once, so we must prioritise.  We need to examine our regional development and how we will move forward in that respect.  I recognise, as the previous speaker said, that people will continue to migrate to cities.  Trains coming in and out of Dublin at weekends are packed with young people who are working in the capital.  Many people have settled in Cork city from Limerick, Clare, Tipperary, Waterford and Kerry.  Cities attract a young migrant population because that is where the jobs, services and quality of life are.Following the last review of Dáil constituency boundaries, Cork city and county lost a seat which went to the east.  Seats were also lost in Limerick and Kerry, which also went to the east.  No matter how often we produce plans to resettle population, such as the national spatial strategy, people will still migrate.  This is reflected in recent changes in the allocation of Dáil seats, which went eastwards in line with population movements.The National Competitiveness Council recently produced an excellent report.  All the NCC's reports should be debated in this Chamber, but I wonder if they receive the attention they deserve.  The most recent one was on prioritising our cities, which is critical for sustainable economic growth.  We need to prioritise investment in our main cities to enhance long-term competitiveness.  The report referred to the need for key planning decisions to be made by strong leadership with responsibility for providing a co-ordinated approach to issues faced by greater urban areas.  That reflects the point that local people — those in leadership positions in their own communities — have better knowledge of how to develop such areas in future.  That includes improving the urban land use and planning policy, which was recommended in the report.  It also identified the need for higher residential density in cities.  Density is an issue as our cities change and older three-bedroom semi-detached houses no longer serve the needs of communities.  People want to live near services, so density is important in that respect.When I visited New York, I was struck by how many millions of people were living on an island as small as Manhattan.  Given that so many million people are living there, they have the services and quality of life, but a balance must be struck.The refusal of planning permission in cases of previously unauthorised development is an old chestnut for all of us who have been involved in local authorities.  A developer might obtain planning permission but then walks away, leaving a development half finished.  The houses may be there, but the services are not in place, yet such a developer can get planning permission to start work again in another area.  There should be a facility for local authorities to clamp down on such people.The provision for extending planning permission for five years on the basis of commercial, economic or technical reasons is important, particularly in light of our current economic position.  People may have obtained planning permissions but are not in a position to develop them, so a facility to extend them would be important.Taking charge of housing estates is another bugbear with local communities.  The Bill contains a provision to move that forward so that property owners can vote to ensure that a housing estate is taken in charge.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	561	Like my colleague, Deputy Clune, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The recent flooding crisis has made it extremely important.  We have witnessed the worst flooding in the history of the State.  It is a timely reminder of the importance of proper planning.  Lessons must be learned about the impact of past decisions.  Deputies will have seen pictures of many areas affected by floods, with people being removed from their homes.  I witnessed this recently myself in Ennis.  In low-lying areas, people were evacuated from houses that had been built only in the last few years.  The property boom of recent years accelerated the problems.  The country is facing serious difficulties now due to planning and what was built in the recent past.At yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Mansergh, said there will be some relocations of the 1,700 people who were evacuated from their houses in recent days.  Many of them will not be able to return home.  In the Springfield-Clonlara area of south east Clare — part of my own constituency, which is familiar to the Acting Chairman, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan — houses have been flooded by up to four feet of water.  The same houses were flooded three or fours ago also.  Will the situation recur in the next few years?  Clare County Council and other local authorities around the country will have to deal with these problems.The programme for Government was supposed to introduce greater accountability for the planning process.  However, even though the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has put this firmly at the top of his agenda since his appointment, his partners in Government may have a different view.  They have dragged their heels on the issue of proper planning, including the implementation of radical reforms.  Nonetheless, reforms are required in our planning system and the Bill goes some way towards dealing with them, but not all the way.Over the past ten years, the number of planning applications has soared.  We have all seen that happen along with the birth of the commuter belts.  The Government's policy was to build as many houses as possible to earn tax revenue from stamp duty.  That fed the boom, but it was a flawed policy.  This country is now in the midst of a recession, which is deeper than any before.The boom is over and the construction industry has collapsed.  This is reflected in the number of planning applications that have been lodged with various local authorities.  In County Clare, up to June this year, some 680 planning applications were lodged, compared to 1,750 applications in 2007.  It illustrates what is happening.  Planning authorities were unable to cope with the amount of applications over the past ten years.  The last decade created many of the problem we must now face.  Lessons have to be learned about the planning system and we must reflect on this matter.Forecasters are predicting that Ireland's rainfall will increase even further in the coming years.  This must be taken into account for good planning.  I am not just referring to the danger of building on flood plains, which has happened, but also the lack of infrastructural planning and development which is making the situation a lot worse.  This is particularly the case in many rural communities which have been affected by the recent flooding.  Flooding brings with it the risk of water contamination, which we have seen in many areas, including south County Galway.  In my constituency the community in Bridgetown was affected by the recent floods and many  people there were left without safe drinking water.  A "boil notice" has been issued by the local authority for people living in the Bridgetown-O'Briensbridge area.  In the constituency of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, at Montpelier, there was a serious problem, as regards serious contamination of the water system after the recent flooding.I have asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government many questions in relation to this, particularly with regard to the O'Briensbridge scheme, but there are other schemes around the county as well.  The Minister understands that additional information is being sought by the Department, and I would appeal that these schemes be fast-tracked, now that we have learned our lesson from the past.  We did not dwell sufficiently on the importance of proper sewerage schemes during the boom for existing towns and villages, and that is a great pity.  Many of them lack the necessary infrastructure.The legislation promises that the planning system will support more targeted investment in infrastructure.  Up to now the system has failed miserably.  Housing developments have sprung up all over the country, and no further infrastructural needs were factored into the equation.  We did not have school infrastructural development for instance.  Neither were there transport facilities, adequate sewerage schemes or proper green area facilities.  As a result, we face many economic problems in the immediate future.  This will happen in the next few years.  People have to commute long distances to work.  There are now more cars on the road and a great many schools face problems as regards new extensions and facilities that are still not in place.Irish Planning Institute president, Mr. Gerry Sheeran, recently said that good planning should serve society.  I ask the Minister of State whether this Bill will serve our society any better.  As others have said, the Bill plans to dilute the powers of local councillors and local authorities.  Are we creating another layer of bureaucracy?  There were problems in the past, but Fine Gael believes we should strengthen local government.  As a former county councillor, I believe we all know our territories and are aware of where people should and should not build.  Councillors should have a say in proper planning.  A triple lock system is in place, in any event, because ultimately it is the planners who make the official decision as regards planning.The Bill gives the Minister more powers to direct planning issues at local level.  We have seen the way this Government has managed policy in this area by feeding a false boom.  Are we now to have a Minister with the power to direct local authorities as and when this is deemed necessary?The public has only two weeks in which to inspect such ministerial directions in terms of submissions.  I ask the Minister when he is reviewing the amendments to the Bill to consider that such a two-week timeframe is much too short.  People would need a longer period in which to make submissions.  It is not practical.The national spatial strategy, which is often feted by Ministers as the Government's way of ensuring balanced development, is a blueprint prepared in Dublin with very little input from local representatives.  I thought that we were moving away from evolved decision making and towards more democracy at local level.  However, those of us in rural areas know only too well how the policy of increased urbanisation has affected our communities and how young people in rural parishes are being denied planning permission for single houses.  We have seen planning applications for dwellings at too low a level because planners have asked people to build much lower as they were infringing prescribed ridge heights.  Now we see that many such houses are flooded.Like Deputy Clune, I should like to say much more on this, particularly as regards the fact that local authorities will no longer be able to draft plans for centres with populations of fewer than 5,000.  There are implications and I hope they are dealt with on Committee Stage so that we in Fine Gael may also have an input.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	562	Running through this debate in the last few hours has been a consistent theme as regards people asking themselves what is meant by planning.  There is room for considerable confusion and words such as "hierarchies" and "strategies" tend to cloud the essence of what is involved.  It is best illustrated by examples.  For me good planning is when children can be allowed to walk or cycle to school by themselves.  Good planning is when an aging mother or father is safe in the family home at night.  Good planning is allowing people to live, work and relax within a fairly short space of each other, rather than being forced into commuting long distances by car every day.It cannot be overly prescriptive and needs to be consistent.  The planning documents and plans we have need to form a consistent whole, and that is part of what this Bill is doing.  In many ways it was inspired by a key problem, as identified in a court case, McEvoy and Smith v. Meath County Council.  Until then we thought there was some coherence between the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines and the development plan.  In that court case, however, it was shown that the wording in the 2000 Act which referred to having regard to the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines did not cut the mustard.  It did not have the strength that was required.  That is why section 13 of this Bill provides that a planning authority shall ensure, when making a development or local area plan, that it is consistent with any regional planning guidelines in force for the particular area.  That is a major step forward, as we have to integrate the national spatial strategy at a national level, the regional planning guidelines, county and city development plans and local area plans.  Essentially, planning is about making all of these, what I may term “ducks”, line up in a row and work well for the entire community.  That is so important if planning goals are to be achieved.I have difficulties with the national spatial strategy.  It tried to deliver far too much for too many.  If we had a choice, regardless of whether we live in Loop Head, Dún Laoghaire or Gweedore, we should all like to have a high-tech cancer centre five minutes down the road.  However, that simply cannot be done, given the available resources.  A plan or national spatial strategy cannot deliver everything.  The national spatial strategy was compromised in trying to deliver to too many people, and accordingly was diluted through trying to achieve all of that.  If we can concentrate the right type of development in the appropriate areas, however, there will be a win, as regards education, health and job creation in so many areas.  That will be to the good.Deputy Clune earlier raised concerns about the requirement for a two thirds majority in certain instances.  It should be relatively easy to adopt a draft plan that provides for, say, 50% approval, but if it is to be changed at a later stage, then the bar needs to be set fairly high.  One of the difficulties is that amendments to the draft plan may not have been put on public display, so that members of the public will not have had a chance to make their views known.  I believe the bar should be set fairly high for those last minute changes that can come about in the plan.Before the debate is adjourned, I should like to deal with the issue of flooding over the last few days.  If anything has concentrated minds as regards the need for proper planning it is the floods which have brought misery to so many people.  We need consistent strong good planning to stop areas from becoming flooded.  I mentioned this to one of the Fine Gael backbenchers earlier and he put it to me that all we needed was good drainage, rather than good planning.  I believe we need both.  We need the good drainage but we need the good planning as well.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion and am glad the Labour Party has tabled it.  I also am pleased with the position of my party, Fine Gael and that of Deputy Kenny in respect of child benefit.  It is important to spell out clearly that Fine Gael and the Labour Party are committed to women.  I wish to repeat a point I have made in the House previously, which is that child benefit is the only payment that is paid to women.  Like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and other Members, I hold clinics on a regular basis and I cannot count the number of times over the years that my constituency office has been visited by women who were married to rich and mean men.  I refer to men who one would think were wealthy and would be good to their wives and families.  However, such men were mean and would not give their wives any of their incomes or additional money to look after their children.  The payment of child benefit has kept many women alive and has provided them with a small degree of independence.  If Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Independent Members attack women in this budget, I can forecast the outcome.  One should not anger women because when they unite, fight and come together, they will make the Government pay and will make it realise it has made a major mistake.  I assure Members the women of Ireland will organise if the Government attacks child benefit in the forthcoming budget.The family and children are still important in Ireland.  Over the past year in particular, as the reports regarding the protection of children have emerged, it is clear the State failed to protect the most vulnerable children.  At least child benefit still remains to protect them at present.  Many women have put that money away to have additional money for Christmas, for an additional pair of shoes, for school books or to educate their children in the future.  The biggest single mistake that Fianna Fáil and the Government could make would be to tamper in any way with child benefit in the forthcoming budget.I have heard the argument about the rich, the middle classes and the poor and how the benefit should be targeted at those who need it most.  The people who need it most are small children.  Moreover, the people who are being described as being well off pay their taxes and their dues and get very little from the State.  In some cases, this benefit is the only income they receive from the State, although they are obliged to make payments continually.  They pay their mortgages or rents and in some cases are not entitled to medical cards.  They are caught in every situation and constitute the new poor.  I refer in particular to middle class people who are obliged to pay for everything and whose only benefit from the State is child benefit.I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, is a new and young Minister.  I hope her period of office will continue for another few months before my party takes over.  I am glad she has had her little run——

They seek change and if the Government tampers in any way with child benefit next week, I assure the Minister of State that the women of Ireland will unite.  They will be at the gates of Leinster House, the Minister of State's clinic and the clinics of everyone in Fianna Fáil by the following week.  I guarantee the Minister of State that such a decision would be reversed before Christmas Eve.I acknowledge the Government has increased child benefit in recent years.  However, it should not undo all the good work that has been done in recent years.  This is a single payment that should be protected because it is paid to women.  Women look after the family and their children and this payment should not be tampered with.  The present payments should be left to every woman in the State.  People have put that money aside and have plans for it in the future.  I hope it is left to them.
#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I welcome this important motion.  As it states that cutting child benefit would be far more deflationary than alternative revenue, it is about choices.  While the Government clearly has tough choices to make, I urge it not to make this choice at all.  Child benefit already has been cut for next year.  It was announced in the budget of October 2008 that child benefit for children over the age of 18 would be halved in 2009.  That measure will cost each family with an 18-year-old €1,000 in 2009.  In addition, from 2010, any family with an 18-year-old in full-time education will receive no child benefit for that person.  In 2010, this will cost each family with an 18-year-old the enormous sum of €2,000.  It constitutes a huge disincentive for such families, many of whom need this money to keep those children in education and some of whom cannot afford to do so without this support.  This measure is akin to shooting ourselves in the foot economically, because people must be trained and educated and everyone values the impact of so doing on the economy.  Consequently, making the choice to take away that support is not good for anyone and I urge the Government not to do so.The position of families with children has deteriorated relative to families without children throughout the boom, because the economic boom was all about individualisation of the taxation system and individualisation of society.  In the budget for 2000, the then Minister, Charlie McCreevy, announced individualisation of the taxation system to give £900 million in tax breaks to double-income families and to single individuals.  None of this money was given to families with children, which in many cases had only one person earning.  The resulting backlash meant the Minister was obliged to rewrite his budget twice.  He introduced the home carer's allowance to appear to rebalance it in favour of families with children.  Subsequently, in the following year, he announced that he would double child benefit payments to rebalance the system as it had become clear that the effect of the Government's actions had been to disadvantage people in single income families with children and who face big bills.However, over the years, the doubling of child benefit payments, which was to have taken place over three years, was never delivered on.  At the same time, individualisation of the taxation system was continued, first by increasing the individual tax band to such an extent that a second earner in a family who does not have small children to support and who can afford to go out to work can now earn an additional €25,000 for the family at a marginal tax rate of 25%.  While this is a good benefit about which no one is complaining, the issue pertains to the actual choice.  In addition, more was given for such families.  In reality, this was a huge disincentive for those with larger families or with single incomes.  The increased child benefit was not delivered, which strikes me as being particularly unfair because a consequence of the changes to the taxation system changes is that the Government is now short of money.  It now complains that not enough people are in the top tax rate.  Only 10% of workers are in that rate, which is due to individualisation.  However, when this fact hit home, the Government's first act is to hit the families with children on single incomes.  It seeks to cut child benefit payments and make such families pay for the mistake of individualisation of the taxation system.One major issue is that our international financial reputation has been damaged by the Government's management of the economy because we have a major deficit and this message has gone out to financial markets.  However, our reputation is not the same as our character.  A famous American college basketball coach, John Wooden, coined the phrase that failure to prepare is to prepare to fail.  Another of his many maxims is that reputation is what others think we are but that character is what we really are.  Our character has demonstrated down through the years that we defend children and families with children.  This has been evident in the Supreme Court and elsewhere.  Article 41 of the Constitution states:The State recognises that by her life within the home, woman [these days, it can include man] gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers [and I presume fathers these days in some cases] shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.Cutting child benefit goes to the heart in undermining the character of the Irish nation and is a big mistake.  One cannot say from the outside which families need the money.  For example, I know one businessman, supporting employment, with a business mortgage of €1 million from the bank.  He lives on €200 a week and supports his family.  Cutting child benefit to such an individual would bring his business down, causing others to become unemployed and further deflate the economy.Cutting child benefit will be a deflationary and bad choice.  The country needs the support it provides for families.  Families with children are the ones with the least money to spend in general.  When their money is cut, so is their spending.  If money is taken from those who have much spare money, many of whom do not have children, it will tend to affect their savings.  This in essence is less deflationary a measure and will not have a knock-on effect on the rest of the economy.The motion is correct that there are other alternatives to attacking children by cutting child benefit to raise moneys for the Exchequer.  These would be less deflationary.  I urge the Minister to take note of the motion and make different choices in how the State raises revenue.  It is critical to our character and character is everything.

She should allow anyone else who wishes to speak to make their point, however.  It is a gross discourtesy to anyone not to allow them.Fianna Fáil continues to get little credit for all the moneys that went into social welfare benefits every year since it took power.  Every time there was only caterwauling and crying from the Opposition benches that it was not enough.  Child benefit has increased from €638 million in 2000 to €2.5 billion in 2008.  That is a huge amount of money on a very worthwhile and laudable allowance.  Every woman in the land welcomes the fact that it is paid to the mother, a change introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Women, by and large, have used it for the good of their children, be it for clothes, education or medical costs.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, has ensured that those in the greatest need continue to get the greatest payments.  That is the right sentiment to have.  Many Deputies encouraged people to apply for the family income supplement when it was a little known allowance.  Its allocation has increased from €39.4 million to €200 million this year.  It is an enormous State subvention to people at the very bottom of the ladder in the economy who genuinely need it.  The qualified child increased rate of payment is €26 per child per week, up from €21.60 per child in 2006.  It is targeted at those on social welfare or family income supplement going back to work.  They can keep it for 13 weeks after they have entered employment.  These are great improvements in how we treat children.I commend the various social welfare Ministers who have improved social welfare benefits.  I hope whatever is announced next week will be for the benefit of those in the lowest bracket of economic life.  They need it very much.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	579	Child benefit is hugely important to all families, particularly in the current economic climate.  In the past number of months I have heard much from women and families about child benefit and how dependent they are on it.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs outlined the ways in which families, whether low, middle or high income, depend on the benefit.  Their uses for it vary from basic food to paying the mortgage to making other loan repayments to paying for child care costs.  The benefit allows women the opportunity to work and is paid directly to mothers.  For many women, it has given them the necessary independence, dignity and ability to deal with many household bills related to their children.Some question whether the benefit means anything to middle or high-income earners.  However, while some families may appear to be well-off, often they can be under severe financial strain.  It is important the State cherishes and values each child equally, irrespective of their parents' income.Having said that, it has to be recognised child benefit costs the State €2.5 billion per annum.  This year the social welfare budget will come to more than €21 billion.  All sides of the House recognise a cut of €4 billion must be achieved in the forthcoming budget.  Unfortunately, the Government side is not in the happy position of being able to agree with every single group lobbying for its area to be left alone.  We hear the Opposition calling for no cuts to public sector pay or social welfare.  If so, one then must ask from where will the €4 billion cuts come.It has been evident over the past nine years that child benefit has been a fundamental priority for Fianna Fáil.  Since 2000, we have increased the rate of child benefit from just €53.96 per month for each of their first and second children and €71.11 per month for the third and each subsequent child to €166 and €203 per child respectively.  That shows the commitment on this side of the House to put our money where our mouths are, by allocating significant funding to child benefit when we were in a position to afford it.  This has benefited over 600,000 households.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, has gone to great lengths to ensure she has listened to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the National Womens Council, CORI and all sides of the House in this debate.  The Minister has various options.  She could tax child benefit or means test it.  I disagree with both options.  She could take a straight cut off the top or leave it alone, the preferable option.  Although there has been deflation of approximately 5% in the past year, if the Minister must go down any of these roads, she should take a small amount off the top and keep it to the smallest margin possible.I welcome that from 1 January 2010 a free preschool place will be made available to all children in the year prior to their starting school, which is an important development.  The Government gave a commitment to provide equal access to all children.  Many children who would not have had an opportunity of obtaining a preschool place in a crèche will have such opportunity from next year.

We are delighted that, despite comment by the Opposition that these places would never be made available, 98,000 places have been made available. This scheme which provides direct support to families and direct benefit to children is, I believe, headed for great success.  My message, as a mother of young children — I am conscious of this having met with many people with young children — is that child benefit is important to all families.  Families need it and are dependent on it now more than ever given the times in which we live.  I ask the Minister to bear this in mind and to be as fair and equitable as possible in next week's budget.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	582	The fundamental criticism of the Government by the Opposition at this time is that it has spent too much and has let the public finances get out of control.  Child benefit has increased from €638 million in 2000 to €2.5 billion this year.  Is it this to what they are referring when they say spending is out of control?  The Government has spent a large amount of money in this area.  We must ask the fundamental question of the Opposition, when the leaders of the two main parties appear on important television programmes and announce with great authority that the public finances must be cut by €4 billion, in what areas will they impose cuts to achieve this €4 billion?  They are telling groups who appear before them campaigning on this issue that they are not the ones on whom they will impose cuts.  However, it is important the campaigners on all of these issues are aware that the Opposition is telling that to every group they meet.  There is a fundamental dishonesty at the heart of the Opposition's policies.The fundamental pro-family agenda of Fianna Fáil has been demonstrated by our record during the past few years.  Our record is second to none in terms of supporting families and children.  I know this only too well as a representative of a constituency with one of the youngest age profiles in the country.  There are more children in my constituency than in many others when one averages out the population.  That record must be acknowledged.It must also be acknowledged that the public finances are in deep disorder.  If we fail to make tough decisions now, what will happen next March or April when the Minister or Finance or the National Treasury Management Agency tries to borrow from the world markets the €2 billion per month we require and they say "No?"  What will we do then?  We will be castigated by the Opposition for not imposing enough cuts, which is not what they are saying now.  We must take a prudent approach to the public finances.  I plead with the Government to take the tough decisions and to be as tough as possible to save the country and children.

While their current child benefit payments are generous they are vital to them.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	605	I thank Deputy O'Rourke for sharing time with me.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.We all recognise the difficult economic situation in which we find ourselves.  The Government is cognisant of the fact that this is a difficult time for many families throughout the country.  We have a growing number of people looking to the State for support.  This is, unfortunately, increasing on a daily basis owing to the increase in the number of people on the live register.  The Government has done its best in the past few difficult years to prioritise social welfare with the overriding principle that we will be fair and equitable while protecting the most vulnerable people in our society.  This will continue to be its overriding principle.  The Minister was clear on this in his contribution last night.As a country, we are borrowing €420 million per week for day-to-day living, which is not sustainable.  I recall when on holiday a number of years ago that my husband bought me a postcard which said: "If your outgoings are more than your incomings, your upkeep will be your downfall".  If we are increasing our borrowing this means our interest repayments are increasing, leaving us with less money to spend on day-to-day living.  If we continue to do this we will find ourselves in a much worse situation and facing the possibility of having European agencies coming in here to take a closer look at what is happening.When we had money to do so, we gave significant increases in payments to families.  It is widely recognised that the increases in child benefit during the good years helped all families.  They have played a major role in reducing child poverty.  Many members referred this evening to the requirement to cherish all of the children of the nation equally.  In 1944, child benefit was only paid in respect of a third child.  In 1963, all children under 16 years of age became eligible for child benefit.  In 1974, the payment was vested in the mother.  We have come a long way.Child benefit is in the main paid to women, who are good managers, in particular when it comes to dealing with money in the household.  Child benefit payments are utilised in many ways.  I agree with those speakers who stated that there are wealthy men in this country who do not give to the woman of the house that to which she is entitled and deserves and that for this reason women depend on child benefit payments.  Often women are waiting on child benefit payments to buy clothes, shoes, books or to even put food on the table.  This payment is important, in particular at Christmas time, given the expense involved.I cannot pre-empt what the Minister for Finance might do in the budget.  However, I am sure he will strive to find a fair and equitable way of dealing with child benefit payments, with the overriding principle of protecting the most vulnerable in society.  The Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Health and Children and Education and Science are the three biggest in terms of spending.  We cannot exempt any of these Departments from the cuts.  Every area must be considered.There have been huge investments and major improvements in child care, which have given women greater opportunities particularly in terms of seeking employment.  At the end of last year, people approached me to discuss the ending of the early child care supplement.  The same people now tell me they are delighted their child will have a free preschool year.  They consider it to be a wonderful achievement that this opportunity will be available to all children.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	608	I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  I compliment our colleague, Deputy Róisín Shortall, on giving us the opportunity to make these contributions.  I do not remember 1944, but I remember bygone days when, as a small child, I was aware that my mother collected the child benefit.  It was a long time ago but on those days, which is probably why I remember them, one got an extra penny for going to the shops.  At that time it was not compulsory for the mother to draw the benefit but in our case my mother did.  I do not hesitate to support calls on the Minister to do her utmost next week where child benefit is concerned.Many people have been saying to me in recent days that they wish today was budget day because, as the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said recently, there has never been so much debate, speculation and comment on a budget.  That has been the case throughout the past number of weeks.  In Tallaght, where I live, one can see posters on almost every lamp post — they have been produced by the Socialist Party, to which I do not mind giving a plug — urging people to turn up at my clinic in Tallaght Welfare Society next Saturday morning to protest.  If I tried to advertise my availability, the council would summons me and take down the posters.  However, the socialists can do it.  It is a reminder of the season we are in.Like other colleagues, we have been meeting various groups in recent weeks.  They make strong cases on behalf of their causes.  As Vice Chairman of the committee on social and family affairs I, along with Deputies Róisín Shortall, Thomas Byrne and other colleagues as well as the Chairman, Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae, have met the carers, the Alzheimers group and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Every group can make a strong case for their cause.  We have been listening to them on the Government benches and we are anxious to represent what they say and their serious concerns.  To be parochial again, I am a member of the board of Tallaght Welfare Society.  It has been in existence for 40 years, serving the disadvantaged in a caring way.  The society made a pre-budget submission this year as always, which mentioned all the issues that concern communities.  The society highlighted the importance of child benefit.I listened to the Minister's contribution last night and I was glad she made the point that at this important time in our history child benefit remains a priority for the vulnerable families who need it.  I will not get into the argument about millionaire families receiving the benefit.  I have a clear view but I must be careful how I express it because the last time I expressed it I was misquoted.  I do not mind being misquoted because any publicity at my level is appreciated, but it is important to make the point that I want to continue to represent people who are in the less well-off bracket and people who are vulnerable.  We always said that at a time when big boats were rising it was important to remember the little boats.  If all boats are struggling, it is absolutely imperative to look after the little boats.All the organisations I mentioned, and others, have spoken.  There were protests outside this building today and yesterday.  Everybody has a strong case to make and a cause all of us would wish to support.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, well over the next week because she will have a difficult job.  I hope even Members on the Opposition benches will support her.  She will have to fight her cause and I suspect she will do it very skilfully.  The announcement will be made this day next week, although, as I said earlier, many people are saying to me, "For God's sake, let us have it today".  I hope the vulnerable are protected, and that includes child benefit.

Anybody who has had the privilege and responsibility of raising children knows what the costs are and how those costs change as children grow older.  Sometimes it amazes me that, to judge by some of the comments that are made, people do not recognise the huge improvements that have been made in recent years with regard to child care and particularly child benefit.  It is interesting to look at the numbers.  In 1982, child benefit for the first five children was €8.86 each and €13.78 for the sixth child.  In 1992, it was €20 each for the first three children and €29.07 for the fourth child.  There have been major increases each year over the past ten years.The reasons for those increases are as valid today as they were ten, eight or five years ago.  This Government has always recognised the importance of the child benefit payment for all families.  There has been some discussion about wealthy families compared to other families but, in my experience, every family uses the child benefit, and particularly those on low incomes.  These are the people we must protect, and we must make tough decisions to do that.  They depend on child benefit more than others.  In light of the increases that have occurred, there can be no argument but that things have improved over the years.  As the Minister said last night, families who are dependent on basic social welfare payments are entitled to extra payments.Child benefit plays a huge role in many families.  Every week in my constituency, I encounter family units, be they couples or single parents, who are dependent on all the payments they receive, including child benefit.  To sustain the current position and to ensure those payments continue to be made each week and month, we must make some tough decisions next week.  Everybody in the House would argue that we must protect the most vulnerable and those who depend on welfare.  We must keep people in jobs.  Basically, we must ensure that the children of this generation and the next are not burdened with huge debt whereby they will be unable to pay any welfare payments, including child benefit.I have no hesitation supporting the Government's amendment because, when we were able, we have made a difference to people's lives on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.  If we are to continue to do that, we must make a decision to protect those who depend on welfare the most, those who are losing their jobs or are under threat of losing their jobs and to sustain people who are in employment.  Our decisions in the next week will feed directly into how children are treated.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	617	I welcome the opportunity to have even a few minutes to speak on this important Labour Party motion, which I support strongly and on which many Labour Deputies, given their experience with children and families, are likely to speak.We have listened to a great deal of wind from those opposite.  If people are in favour of children and their welfare, they will have an opportunity at 8.30 p.m. to vote with us on this motion.  Let us take what I just heard.  We were asked whether we ever believed that child benefit would rise in cost from €638 million to €2.5 billion.  Is this not interesting?  One does not find people on the Government side of the House discussing the €600 million that goes on rental income for landlords, the €400 million the Government gave in property reliefs or the hundreds of millions of euro that it allowed through pension contributions from people on the highest incomes.  In fact, the windy statement is that tough decisions must be taken.  One of the toughest decisions will be to put an end to the gross inequality in tax reliefs and benefits that managed to puff up the economy to the point of collapse.I want to discuss children realistically.  People mentioned the increase to €2.5 billion, but significant things have happened to the Irish family.  Former European Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, presided over the cuts in question when he was the Minister for Finance, but I remember, when I entered the House, children used to live in a home.  Then, it became a question of putting one's foot on the property ladder à la McCreevy and the rest of the property people on the other side of the House.  They suggested that people should keep on speculating.  Suddenly, it was not sufficient for one person to have an income and to get a mortgage amounting to three and a half times that income.  Both people were conscripted into work in the property racket, in which people paid greater amounts for houses that had nothing to do with building costs or the houses’ reasonable values.  Now, the property people are telling us that we all lived it up.  We were not all Seanie FitzPatricks.  We did not all borrow €106 million from our own banks.  We were not shifting money from a bank to a building society.  It is time for all of this “We” stuff to stop.What will be decided at 8.30 p.m. is whether child benefit will be left intact from any measure.  There are good reasons for leaving it alone, including the principle of universality.  Let us say we are building a new kind of economy and society and that we accept all children as being equal.  If one accepts the concept of universality of child benefit, one also assists citizenship.  Whether we are here a day or 20 years, we all know that the earlier one intervenes in a child's welfare, the better the chance of achieving equality.  We also know that, given our society, it is mothers who use the payment, sometimes to ensure the child's survival and sometimes for the most minimal benefit.  We know that the way it is allocated does not create a poverty trap.  The ESRI, the Commission on Taxation and others have examined child benefit, but have not suggested a mechanism to change it.  Therefore, the Labour Party asks that children be left alone at least and that this benefit be left in the homes that need it the most.We have heard a lot of what I would call "stuff" about how, when times were good, we did such and such.  When times were good, the Fianna Fáil Party looked after property speculators.  When times are bad, it cannot be trusted to look after the poor.  To the person at the back who suggested that an election would be awful, I say the sooner the better.  It is important to state that none of us on this side of the House has been invited or is willing to participate in some kind of consensus that would keep the rackets or property circulation going.  We want to acknowledge that they are gone forever.  As we begin putting something new in place, we want to know whether all children will be treated equally and whether this minimal benefit will go to those who need it desperately.  For this reason, the test is not whether people claim they know this or that or that they met someone with triplets or twins.  At 8.30 p.m., they will have their chance.  They will either vote with us or against us.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	619	In the wake of the Murphy report, given what probably will be the worst budget on record and with divisiveness on the airwaves, it is essential that we start developing a set of values with which everyone can concur.  This is a question of leadership.  A core value must be the common good.  We hear about it in other countries, but Ireland seems to have forgotten it.  I concur with my colleague, Deputy Higgins, in that the greed that drove the country for the past ten or 12 years must be wiped out and replaced with a set of proper values, including valuing children, which we have not been doing.In terms of children, one aspect that was handled well was the universal children's allowance or, as it has become, child benefit.  Last night, Deputy Tuffy outlined the benefit's history and the importance of the concept of universality at the time of the benefit's introduction, the concept that all children are equal and have a right to be given money that should not be used for any other purpose.  This concept is at the core of what the Labour Party is trying to maintain in the context of this debate.  Given the scandals of the Murphy and Ryan reports and the abuse of children, we have not valued children centrally.  We have not given them a position in the Constitution, although it is now a priority for the Dáil.  The concept of a universal payment for all children is central to the core value to which I referred.Ireland has a great sense of solidarity, as was evident during the recent floods.  I visited various communities in my constituency in which neighbour rallied around and supported neighbour.  Anyone who listened to the airwaves this morning would have heard of the woman from the west who set up a website to allow people to help victims of flooding with things in kind and with kindness.  She received a flood of responses from all over the country.  It is not as if we are bad people or that we do not care about each other, but we do not have the necessary leadership in Government and public policy to put such matters at the heart of what we are about.  It is a question of paying one's fair share of tax and, in return, getting one's fair share of public services that are available to all on the basis of need or, in this case, being a child.  This concept is core to what the Labour Party has been about for a long time and people are crying out for a set of values that are similar to our proposal.  People are looking for leadership so they can be proud to be Irish and be republicans in the true sense of that word.The universal payment for children goes alongside what we believe to be a universal right to access to education and, on the basis of need rather than ability to pay, health care.  During the so-called Celtic tiger years, such values were broken up and people were set against one another.  There was a climate of greed in which the Seanies of this world were up on top and could do what they liked.  They were protected within the taxation system and through the way in which business was done.  We need to turn around this situation and start examining our values.  We need to embrace the concept of the common good, particularly the good of children, who are society's most vulnerable members.  They need to be protected from poverty and exploitation.  Statistics are available to show that families with children are more likely to suffer from poverty than other categories of family in this country.  This is a core value.  If it is taken apart in some way by the Government in next week's budget, or during tonight's vote, we will have cast aside part of what it means to be a Republic.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I compliment Deputy Shortall on the motion she has brought before the House.  It is particularly important as we approach next week's budget.  We need to consider carefully how we intend to create a fair and equitable society.  We need to pay more than lip service to the idea that all our children are cherished properly.  As we have just heard, the core values of pure republicanism need to be considered when we speak about the issue of universal payment.  I suggest that the central issue is one of rights.  When the early child care supplement is abolished next month, no form of State funding other than child benefit will be available to all families as a contribution towards the cost of raising children.  Nothing else will be specifically targeted at the child.  Every child needs to be cherished and recognised by the State, regardless of the circumstances of the child's parents.  The availability of child benefit on the basis of means testing the parents does not take the child's needs into account and therefore discriminates against the child.  We have to look at this matter carefully from the point of view of the child, rather than from the perspective of the parents' means.  It is important that we approach the issue of child benefit from the position of the child and set aside the parents and any other consideration.  It is a question of the basic human rights of the child.   The State has paid lip service to the concept of cherishing the children of the nation equally far too often.  It has considered everyone except the child.Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about the Murphy report on child abuse in the Archdiocese of Dublin.  Earlier this year, the Ryan report on the abuse of children in industrial schools and reformatories demonstrated how poorly Ireland has protected, nurtured and cherished its children.  When the House debated the issue of adoption last week, reference was made to the criticism by UNICEF of the manner in which Ireland conducts adoption proceedings with Vietnam.  It has warned against further adoptions until the Hague Convention has been ratified in Irish law and appropriate structures have been put in place.  We have not been good in our dealings with our own children or children from overseas.  When we dealt with the trafficking of women and children the week before last, it was once more pointed out that the relevant international conventions have not been enacted in Ireland to ensure children are not trafficked into this country.  All of this shows that we have not pursued the rights of the child in a proper fashion.  The lack of a constitutional provision to uphold the rights of the child spells it all out.  We have constitutional provisions on the rights of the family and adults, but the rights of the child are neglected in the Constitution.  That area should be addressed.The withdrawal of child benefit from any family would be a retrograde step for children's rights and children's welfare.  Those who do not agree that child benefit should not be reduced argue that certain parents do not need child benefit.  Of course there are very wealthy people like Mr. Smurfit and Mr. O'Reilly in this country.  If we are really interested in organising society on a rights-based, fair and ethical fashion, we should use the taxation system to that end.  We should tax those adults who can afford it, without interfering with the rights of children.  The Labour Party has proposed the development of a third tier of taxation.  A 48% rate of tax should apply to those who are well off.  We should proceed in such a manner, rather than by taking from this sector of the population the one State provision that is available to it.  Nothing else in the budget will be directly targeted at the child, as distinct from the family, adults, education or some other consideration.  We should hold onto this universal core payment.  It should not be reduced.  We should not provide for the testing of income in this case.  It should be maintained down the line.  If we ensure child benefit is not reduced in the forthcoming budget, we will enhance the rights of the child.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13510	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	621	I would like to quote from an academic analysis that suggests an additional unit of income earned or gained by a female is more likely to be spent on child care, or children's clothing, than an additional unit of income earned or gained by a male.  The report in question, The Kids are Alright: Who Benefits from Child Benefit?  An Analysis Using Irish Data, which was published by Dr. David Madden in March 2000, states:Child Benefit in Ireland is unlike most other transfer payments in two respects.  First, it is a universal non means-tested payment made to all families with children.  The second unusual feature regarding child benefit is that it is normally paid to the child's mother or step-mother.  If the child does not live with the mother or step-mother, then it may be paid to the child's father or step-father.The report continues:The combination of these two factors implies that analysis of child benefit and the pattern of expenditure from child benefit can throw light on a number of features of interest.  The first of these concerns the issue of within household allocation.  Much economic analysis treats the family as the unit of measurement and little attention is paid to the allocation of resources within the household.  Since child benefit is paid to the mother then analysis of how it is spent may shed light on the degree to which ownership of a source of income may affect its use.Dr. Madden's analysis refers to a report published in the UK, which shows how:A change in the payment of child benefit from fathers to mothers led to increased expenditure on children's clothing.  In a similar vein [another report showed] the different influence of male and female incomes on patterns of household expenditures.  They find that an extra unit of female income is more likely to be spent on childcare or children's clothing than is an extra unit of male income.The Madden report continues:If the propensity to consume "child-intensive" goods such as food or children's clothing is higher from child benefit than other sources of income then it seems reasonable to infer that children do gain disproportionately from child benefit.  The universality of child benefit lends itself in particular to the analysis of this issue since it implies that apart from the obvious difference of having children, families receiving child benefit should be reasonably representative of the population at large.Dr. Madden also refers to the 1994 Rottman report, which examined some of these issues.  Although it relates to an original survey from 1987, I suggest that the same principles continue to apply.  The report states:He uses a sample of 625 households who were part of a follow-up to a major survey carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1987.  He finds that the source of income appears to be important from the point of view of sharing of resources.  Households with income derived mainly from social welfare sources share about 33% of their income compared with an average of about 63% for other households.  With regard to child benefit households appear to divide fairly evenly between those who use it for general household spending and those who use it for child specific goods.  That breakdown is sensitive however to who controls the spending of child benefit.  Where it is jointly controlled there is a significantly lower proportion spent on children's goods as opposed to the case where the wife [I assume he means "partner"] controls child benefit.  He also finds that when asked how a windfall increase of £20 per month in household income would be spent, 18% of wives listed children's clothing as a priority as opposed to 10% of husbands.A total of 18% of wives listed children's clothing as a priority, as opposed to 10% of husbands.  The fundamental point here is that this a payment to women for their children.  It is used in households for children, is protected by women for their children and goes directly towards the welfare of children.Although this study may be dated, I believe it stands the test of time.  If the payment goes to women for the welfare of children, then there is a logical case for it to be preserved, as has already been elucidated by my colleagues.  That is our central point.

One thing we can say about this Government is that it is consistent when it comes to cuts.  I will give it that.  It consistently expects the poor, the unemployed, pensioners and low-paid workers in the private and public sectors to bear the brunt of its plans to come out of an economic crisis.  I shall return to the Government's plan, if such exists.The Government seems hell-bent on finding money in places where cuts will be most damaging while remaining intent on protecting the wealthy, the banks and developers.  What does this tell us about the Government's perception of what Irish society should be?  It is shameful.  The Government seems intent on adding to the inequality which grew during the Celtic tiger years.  During the recession years it will increase that inequality and make those on low incomes and low pay who are struggling to make ends meet pay for the mistakes, the mismanagement and the bad planning of this and previous Fianna Fáil Governments and their friends, the developers.The child benefit payment provides much needed support for parents who leave the workforce in order to care for their children.  For those still working, it contributes to the crippling cost of child care fees.  Child care costs in Ireland are far above the EU average.  Irish families spend 20% of their income on full-time creche facilities, compared to 12% spent by families in the rest of Europe.  Child care costs are so high that they are now out of reach of most people on low incomes and many of those on middle incomes.  One must add to that the high costs of food, fuel and electricity prices in Ireland, the high cost of free education and the general high cost of living for those on or near the poverty line.The impact of the proposals to cut child benefit will force many women, in particular, out of work and will leave women working in the home with less support.  For families where women are now the main breadwinners, it will cause increased financial hardship, strain and stress on the family at a time when support is most needed.  Families with massive mortgages will find the child benefit cut to be another setback as they try to manage to keep their heads above water.  This is especially true for those families who, regrettably, have lost a job or two jobs, and are struggling to cope with the change from a time when they could afford the different services to now, when they are totally dependent on social welfare payments.There are very few on the opposite side of the House, or, indeed, on this side, who have ever had to survive on social welfare payments alone.  Very few of us in this House have been dependent for months or years on a social welfare payment.  It is not something I ever wished on anybody but I wish that members of the Government would be made unemployed and that they had to suffer and live in poverty on the breadline for a number of months.  I do not say that lightly because it is not something one would wish on another person.  However, if a person were to live on social welfare, he or she might at least have some understanding of the consequences of cuts in social welfare payments and of leaving people for months and years dependent on social welfare, and the effects on their mindset, their children and the community in which they live.That is exactly what is happening now.  The Government has no plan in place to rescue from the dole queues the 420,000 people who are now unemployed.  We have not seen a job creation package.  The easiest way of dealing with the large social welfare bill facing the Exchequer is to make people employed again.  That will not be done by cutting social welfare payments or reducing child benefit.Let us not forget there have already been significant cuts in child benefit in the past two budgets.  Now, in dire financial times, many people need help most and, by the looks of it, they are going to be most hit once again by the Government.  Already in April, many of the families that will be targeted by this cut were targeted when they lost the Christmas bonus.  That cut is nothing short of Scrooge-like, removing the little top-up for those who are dependent.  We must remember that it was only those people who are entirely dependent on social welfare who received the Christmas bonus.  They will be the ones affected by the cut.  There is no logic to this because, apart from those dependent on welfare, the people hit most will be the local businesses, shops and suppliers of fuel to the pensioners who will not get that payment.  The Christmas bonus payment did not sit in a rich man's or woman's bank account but was spent immediately.  It needed to be spent to bring a bit of festive cheer to many families, particularly children, but also to heat pensioners' homes.That is the small-mindedness of the Government.  It does not understand the consequences and does not poverty-proof any of its actions.  What it does is slash and burn.  It does not care as long as the bankers and developers are not affected.  It hits the people it sees as not having a voice.  However, they have a voice in this House and that is why I support this motion.  It gives a voice to the hundreds of thousands of people who will be affected by any cut in social welfare.Orla O'Connor, head of policy for the National Women's Council of Ireland, said: "At a time when it is reported that €300 million has been lost in the deal to save Anglo Irish Bank, the obsessive focus by the Government in cutting Child Benefit as if it was the only source of saving at this critical time is unacceptable".  It is unacceptable to target the poor in society now, or at any time.  Those who have money must pay most.  One taxes the rich, not the poor.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey, to bring the message home to the Minister for Finance and the rest of the Cabinet that this is unacceptable.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	623	I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the Labour Party motion on the subject of child benefit and to sum up the arguments in favour of the Government's counter-motion.As the Minister for Social and Family Affairs highlighted last night, the improvements that have been made in both child income supports and child care provision in recent years have been unprecedented.  Since 2000, we have increased the rates of child benefit from just €53.96 per month for the first and second child and from €71.11 per month for the third and any subsequent child to €166 and €203 per child, respectively.  In the same period, expenditure on the scheme has grown from just €638 million to €2.5 billion per year.  Improvements have been made in both the qualified child increase paid to welfare-dependent families and the family income supplement paid to low-income working parents.  These improvements in funding for families have been supplemented by increased support for child care programmes, which are expected to create some 65,000 child care places when fully implemented.  From next January, all children will be entitled to a free preschool year.Child benefit is the main thrust of the motion.  As a result of the increases of recent years, a family with four children now receives €738 per month, or €8,856 per year, in child benefit, regardless of how high the parents' earnings are.  The Government is proud to have been able to deliver such significant increases in payments to families when the resources were available.  However, in the current economic environment, we simply cannot afford to keep spending at the same level as we did when our tax revenue was much higher.  Failure to stabilise the public finances would jeopardise our ability to fund social services in the future and make circumstances worse for everyone, including welfare recipients, in the longer term.  In that context, it is important to examine the €2.5 billion being spent on child benefit and to consider how savings might be made in this area.The Commission on Taxation and the authors of the McCarthy report have made proposals on the child benefit programme.  As the Minister for Social and Family Affairs stated last night, in considering these and other options regarding changing the payment, the Government has been determined to find the fairest way of achieving savings while protecting those on low incomes as much as possible.Let me touch on anti-fraud procedures for child benefit payments, as raised a number of times in the earlier part of this debate.  Given the significant changes in the child benefit customer base and in the value of payments, the control policy for the child benefit scheme has been reviewed to ensure controls against fraud and abuse of the schemes continue to be effective and relevant.  As a result of the review, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised.In the case of non-Irish national recipients whose children are resident with them in Ireland, certification that the children continue to reside here is required.  Such proof can be provided by showing details of the school or college the child attends or, if the child is not of school-going age, details of the doctor or crèche they attend.In the case of EU nationals who are working in Ireland but who have qualifying children living in another EU state who are entitled to Irish family benefits under EU law, certification by their employer of continuing employment is requested.  In either case, where the required certification is not provided within the specified timescale, the child benefit payment is suspended pending further inquiry and is ultimately terminated if confirmation of continued entitlement is not forthcoming.

I am reliably told it was in the 1920s.  If this Government cuts child benefit, as it intends, it will be remembered in the same vein.  It is outrageous that the only support mechanism for children in homes should now be targeted by the Government, which gave tax reliefs to developers and landlords like snuff at a wake.  The only people it can now think of targeting are the low paid and those with children to support.The esteem in which the payment is held is demonstrated by the groups that support its retention.  These include the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Children's Rights Alliance, One Family, OPEN and Protest Against Child Unfriendly Budget, PACUB, which is an on-line support system that has attracted 16,000 members in a very short period.  That says it all.  The Government does not want to hear what the cut to the benefit means to families, including children.This is probably the only country in Europe that does not recognise children in any way other than through a child benefit.  It does not recognise them in the tax code or in terms of work or child care, despite what Government backbenchers are saying.  The Government has actually saved money through the introduction of the free year of preschool education because parents do not get a child care supplement for their qualifying child up to the age of six.The Government may rattle off all the figures it likes but should note the payment is only €38 per week per child.  Any mother or father who provides for children every week knows it would not buy a pair of shoes.  We all know this and that is why what I say is important.  The benefit is part and parcel of what we do to provide for children.When individualisation was introduced by Mr. Charlie McCreevy with razzmatazz we had never seen before and to his mantra "party on", it forced women into the workforce.  There was no further recognition for women in the home.  The only recognition of their contribution in the home was child benefit, over which they had control and which they spent on their children.Earlier in the debate, Deputy Mary O'Rourke hailed Fianna Fáil for introducing a mechanism in 1974 whereby child benefit was paid to the mother.  Fianna Fáil did not introduce that policy.  It was introduced by Frank Cluskey and Brendan Corish.  At that time, those two men realised child benefit in the hands of men was not always handed over to women and the children suffered.  Once again, the Government is discussing cutting the payment.There are many people in the country who could do with a cut in terms of income or additional taxation, but children should not be affected.  I find it amazing that when we discuss pensions in this country, we always refer to the fact our population is falling and we need to increase it because in the future we will need people to work in order to ensure pensions are paid.  It is the current income of future workers which will be cut.Children have no protection under the Constitution or the law.  At a time when the Ryan and Murphy reports which referred specifically to crimes against children are in the public domain, the Government is talking about cutting the essential funding now going into homes.  The proposal will not be the first cut to child benefit.  In the last budget the Government cut child benefit payments to the mothers of 18 year olds, who are still in school and whose parents have to support them on a low income.  It is outrageous.Of all the things this Government can cut, child benefit is not one of them.  I wonder if the Government is building up a straw man in order to knock it down.  If the Government hears groups of the calibre of the National Women's Council of Ireland, One Family and other such groups telling it this proposal is not correct and that supporting families and children is the only way we will come through this crisis, that is something of which it must take notice.

The Government will not fall if the Labour Party motion is passed tonight.  Our motion is simply calling on the Government not to touch child benefit in next week's budget.  It is a call and an appeal.  The verb in the Labour Party motion, "calls", is the same verb which is in the Government amendment.  The Government amendment has a curious phrase which I have never seen before, that is, it "calls on the Government to consider the various options around Child Benefit and their implications for the needs of families with children".It is the first time I have seen a member of the Cabinet submit an amendment to a Private Members' motion which calls on her own Government to do something.  In this case, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, is calling for some kind of consideration.  She seems to think the Government is comparable to the ESRI and can spend some time considering the various options in terms of child benefit and the implications for the needs of families.As an alternative, this House can call on the Government to not cut child benefit in the budget next week because family incomes have already taken a substantial hit in the last two budgets, Ireland is still a very expensive place to raise a child and child benefit is the only recognition by the State of this high cost, cutting child benefit will have a deflationary impact on the economy and any of the proposed reforms will create poverty traps, work disincentives, and will increase the numbers of children in poverty.Let us not forget why we are here.  We are debating the Government's stated intention to take money from mothers and children in order to plug the hole it has blown in the public finances.  We are here because Fianna Fáil brought us here.  The same Deputies on Government benches, who now throw up their hands and say that cutting child benefit is the only way, are the very ones whose greed allowed our good economy to be turned into a property bubble.

In this, they are sadly aided by the Green Party, a party ostensibly so committed to children that it put them at the heart of its election campaign in 2007.  Where are those values now?  I do not recall any proposal being put to the Green Party conference which required a two thirds majority to cut child benefit.  It was not in the revised programme for Government.  There is no obligation under the revised programme for Government for it to support this measure.The Government has focused on its role in increasing child benefit payments to families in the past.   However, this motion is not about the past.  Rather, it is about the effect of a cut in child benefit payments will have on families and children now and into the future.  The cut in child benefit is coming on top of a significant reduction in family incomes over the past twelve months.  Families have already been hit with a reduction in mortgage interest relief, the cutting of child benefit for 18 year olds, a large increase in school transport costs, the halving of the early childcare supplement, which will be abolished from January and income levies.  For the 150,000 people who have joined the live register since this time last year, child benefit is often a lifeline which helps keep food on the table and the house warm, even if one parent still has a job.Since the emergency budget in April I have received hundreds of letters, many from concerned mothers who say that between the income levies and the pension levy for public servants they are barely able to make ends meet.  For young parents with large mortgages and high child care costs, a cut in child benefit will create a genuine crisis.The Government has indicated it favours a three-tiered system for child benefit, comprising those on social welfare and low incomes, those who are very well-off and who identify themselves as such to the Revenue Commissioners and those in the middle.  This is a deeply flawed and fundamentally unfair proposal.  First, making child benefit conditional on receiving social welfare or the family income supplement will act as yet another poverty trap, where it costs people money to move into paid work.  Second, it is risible that the Government, which has consistently facilitated tax avoidance by the super-rich, should propose to rely on those same wealthy people putting their hands up and handing back their child benefit.  We all know who is going to bear the brunt of any cut in child welfare.  It will be those in the middle, namely, PAYE workers who pay for everything and who receive little for it who will bear the brunt.One can only tap the same source for so long before it runs dry.  Child benefit is not, as some would characterise it, a contribution towards the luxuries of life.  For the overwhelming majority it is money which parents count on to pay for child care, for trips to the doctor, for food and clothing for their children.  For tens of thousands of families in this recession it is a crucial source of household income which just about keeps them afloat.Fianna Fáil congratulates itself on the generosity of the child benefit payment, but it must be seen in context.  Child benefit is the Swiss knife of the social welfare system.  It is supposed to compensate for the fact that Ireland's tax code does not recognise the cost of bringing up children, to address child poverty, to make up for the lack of affordable child care or the fact that Ireland, almost uniquely in the European Union, does not have a universal pre-school system.  It is meant to compensate for the absence of free medical care for children.No welfare payment, however generous, could achieve all of these objectives.  It requires the vision to invest in an affordable, national child care system.  It requires the courage to introduce universal health insurance for children, as the Labour Party has proposed since 2002.  In short, it requires a value system which works the well-being of children and families into the permanent structures of our society and State.There is, however, little evidence of such values in the policies being pursued by this Government.  Ministers never miss an opportunity to remind people that they increased social welfare rates during the good years.  However, now that the good years are over they tell us they can no longer afford these payments.  The Government's policy now appears to be Fianna Fáil giveth and Fianna Fáil taketh away, but the people's answer to that in the course of time may well be that the people giveth and the people taketh away.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  From 7 December, for two weeks, environment Ministers and officials from around the world will meet in Copenhagen for the 15th UN climate change conference to thrash out a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, will represent Ireland at this critical summit where agreement on a new legal framework to tackling global warming from 2013 must be reached.I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  It is fair to that we have no one better or more committed than he to represent us.  He has spent all his political life, if not all his adult life, committed to the environment and we are very lucky to have a Minister like him representing us there.Today we heard the positive news that India, in common with the other major greenhouse gas emitters, China and the US, is likely to announce its emissions target in advance of next week's conference.  This shows real commitment that larger countries are now prepared to tackle the very real challenges of climate change.  Over the past decade and beyond, the larger countries did not make any great commitment to reaching their targets.Last week Ireland witnessed at first hand the devastating effects of climate change.  I listened to Mr. Gerald Fleming telling Cathal Mac Coille that in his opinion the unprecedented rainfall we have witnessed is more than just a freak event, rather it is the very real effects of global warming.  The awful scenes we have witnessed of families struggling to pick up the pieces of the lives, homes and businesses in which they have invested so much time and commitment drive home the reality that immediate action must be taken to combat the issue of climate change at an international level.The Government clearly recognises that we must also lead the way at home in Ireland on this issue.  A few weeks ago the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security discussed the committee's report which included outline proposals for a climate change Bill.  The report is a valuable input to development of a climate change Bill, the heads of which are now being developed.  There is clear all-party support for this legislation and in early December a framework document on the proposed legislation will be published.The recently reviewed programme for Government also reiterated the Government's commitment to climate change.  It stated that a new climate change Bill will give a statutory basis to the annual carbon budget incorporating a target of 3% annual average reductions on greenhouse gas emissions.There was also a commitment within the programme to introduce a carbon tax in the budget on 9 December along with an adjustment in the ratio of expenditure on new Transport 21 projects.  Between public transport and national roads programme, there will be a ratio of 2:1 in favour of public transport.  Certainly, that is an achievable objective if we are committed to it.Likewise, the Government's action plan, Smarter Travel — A Sustainable Transport Future, is a very positive development in the Government's response to the significant challenges presented by Ireland's transport system.  The plan recognises the need for a fundamental shift from private transport to more sustainable modes of transport.  I am pleased to mention one project, the new DART underground, currently at consultation stage, which on completion will treble the greater Dublin area's rail service capacity from 33 million passenger journeys annually to 100 million passenger journeys annually.  Its construction will be of enormous benefit to people and will be critical in assisting the shift from private to public transport.The action plan also highlights the pivotal role spatial and transport planning will play in tackling Ireland's urban sprawl and, by default, our carbon emissions.  The report recommends that the instance of urban generated one-off housing in peri-urban areas must cease and recommends general minimum housing density of between 35 and 50 dwellings per hectare in urban areas of suitable size and population, and requiring substantially higher densities where local circumstances warrant it.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	653	While the Minister is away in Copenhagen, I can guarantee that the constituency will be well looked after.This plan also highlights the need for the promotion of targets which would require a minimum percentage of new residential and mixed-use development to take place on brownfield and existing sites to consolidate urban growth and enable organic development of urban areas from the centre out.  Dublin City Council is looking at its development plan and this brings challenges on heights and densities.  It is a difficult issue with which to deal.In the period 2008 to 2012, Ireland is required to meet a challenging greenhouse gas emission reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol.  This target is binding in international law.  In addition, by 2020 Ireland is committed under the EU climate and energy package agreed in December 2008 to achieve a 20% reduction on 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the sectors of the economy not covered by the EU emissions trading scheme.  This target is binding in EU law, as will be any adjustment to it in light of the outcome to the conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen next week.  Under a new international agreement on climate change, these cuts will become binding on Ireland.  I certainly support this Government which is determined in its efforts to tackle climate change on a national level through a climate change Bill and the introduction of a carbon tax.  This will lay the groundwork for achieving targets set under a new post-Kyoto international agreement.  In April this year, the Minister requested that the National Treasury Management Agency stop buying carbon credits abroad on the basis that Ireland will now meet its targets under the Kyoto Protocol due to the economic slowdown and the reduction in business here.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has asked the NTMA to put its programme of carbon purchasing on hold for the foreseeable future.  The Government clearly recognises that we need to move towards a low carbon economy at home and abroad to prevent increased poverty and catastrophic changes to the natural environment.Like many others, I am a newcomer to the issue of climate change.  We can certainly learn from the Green Party and that is why it is a benefit having that party in Government because of that commitment.  The Green Party's members have been long-time advocates of making changes at national and international level to improve our position.  I fully support the Government's efforts to tackle climate change and believe that we will make huge progress in this regard over the next year.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	654	I thank the Whips for providing additional time for this debate, which is greatly appreciated.  The importance of what we are discussing must be stressed, which is the preparation for the UN convention on climate change which will take place in Copenhagen from 7 to 18 December.  We should all recognise that climate change is probably the most significant threat to the global environment currently facing humanity.  It is being brought about for the most part as a consequence of human activity.  Unless we are prepared to face up to this reality, climate change will create a very different living and working environment, especially for those less fortunate people living in the Third World.  Anybody with eyes to see can read the documentation and learn that what is happening in the Third World is no accident or temporary change in climate patterns.International concern about climate change is increasing rapidly, but action to deal with it lags far behind.  I sincerely hope the Copenhagen convention will be taken seriously by all 192 countries due to participate in the event.  It is hoped that a common plan can be satisfactorily concluded to prevent the world's climate being disrupted by human activity.  The convention faces great challenges and will demand great leadership.In fairness to the European Union, it made the first commitment to take action, which Ireland has bought into.  As the previous speaker said, this is not a party political issue.  It is one that faces all of us, irrespective of who is in Government.  As chairman of the Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, I can say that it operates on an all-party basis.  Any report that the committee produces has all-party agreement.  If those who go to Copenhagen adopt a similar attitude, and do not try to throw their weight around, we might reach a satisfactory conclusion.The EU was first into the field and has committed itself to a 20% reduction on 1990 carbon emission levels by 2020, or up to 30% if there is an international agreement.  This contrasts with the United States, which has not yet reached agreement on the relevant legislation currently before the US Senate.  Even if agreement is reached there, however, the proposal would amount, at best, to a reduction of approximately 7% below the 1990 levels by 2020.  Looking at the problems facing the US, it is clear that their representatives need to cop on very quickly.  They should leave aside the vested interests that are persuading many members of the Senate not to support the legislation.  It is worrying that no Republican senators are prepared to back the legislation at present.  It is quite frightening to see a situation where party politics are playing a major part in preventing the leaders going to Copenhagen to represent the United States from having a sound mandate from the US Senate.  One can expect that the US legislation will not be passed before the end of December because they need 60 senators to vote for it from a total of 100.When one looks at what is happening in the United States, one can see the effects of climate change, including water shortages.  The governor of one US state was reported as saying that 100 million trees were dying in one region because warmer winters allowed certain insects to hatch, thus spreading disease in woodlands.  That concerns one area, but it demonstrates what can happen as a result of climate change patterns.In addition, America's national security would be enhanced through a lack of dependence on continuing oil and gas imports.  These are small examples of what could happen on a larger scale if climate change is not tackled.  It must be faced without people playing politics.There is a problem between developed and developing countries in the context of the forthcoming Copenhagen conference.  EU members states, including Ireland, are part of the developed countries, which have carbon reduction targets to achieve.  The developing counties, however, are not expected to reach particular targets, but will qualify for assistance and will give commitments to take steps to reduce CO2 emissions.  Unfortunately, the developing country category includes China.  Yet China and the United States are together currently producing 40% of all greenhouse gases.  On a per capita basis, however, that is still below what Ireland is producing.  The developing countries caused the problem because of industrial development over the last 100 years, even though China is now catching up.  If one adopts the attitude that China should not be restrained from doing something concrete about the problem, it will give rise to a tricky situation in Copenhagen.  It is also part and parcel of the ongoing investment in dealing with the problem of coal being used to produce energy.  A lot of investment is going into carbon capture and storage, whereby one can extract CO2 and store it.  If that is successful, Ireland should also make provision for the possibility of that technology being developed to the stage where it becomes viable.  It is important to commit ourselves to such targets.  It is also important there is agreement at Copenhagen that the United Nations will have the authority to carry out the inspections required to see that all of us are living up to the targets we are agreeing to.  Having caused the damage, all of us will have to contribute the financial help that will be required by developing countries and the Third World generally.  It is expected that we will be part of a pool that will provide $140 billion for adaptation and mitigation by 2020.This is a subject one could speak on at length.  It is important that all of us here take the problem seriously.  We should not be frightened about dealing with this issue.  There are tremendous investment opportunities in this country if we take on board the whole issue of dealing with climate change and energy security.  For example, there is the whole area of ocean energy, where we have the potential to produce sufficient energy without having to import fossil fuels.  With inter-connection to Scotland, England and France, we have a tremendous export opportunity, but the ball is at our feet.  We have slipped up in terms of wind energy, because Denmark is to the fore in that area.  Let us not lose the opportunity to develop wave and tidal power, which is in abundance along our coastline, particularly in the west.  We need to use this opportunity and not let it pass because there are jobs go leór to be had.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	655	I welcome the fact that we are having this debate and the work done on it by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security in terms of its plans for climate change legislation.  A climate change Bill was originally proposed by the Labour Party and the committee has taken the legislation on board.  The idea is that mitigating and adapting to climate change should be central to Government policy.  The legislation, as proposed, is not prescriptive in any way and neither is it binding in the manner in which the Government, or indeed all of us, might tackle climate change.  It is not even binding regarding the reduction of emissions, although it has targets, and it is expected that the Taoiseach would report on these in the event that they are not reached.Heretofore, climate change has been something of a niche subject.  It is very important, however, that it becomes core Government policy and is driven by the Taoiseach.  It is something that affects everything we do and, as such, it has implications for policy in every Department.  I understand that is the idea behind the legislation as proposed.  Most of the prominent world leaders, such as President Obama of the United States, now tend to talk a great deal about climate change and our leaders in Ireland tend to do the same.  It is somewhat akin to talking about sustainable development for the future.  We should talk about development which will help us mitigate the effects of climate change and adopt initiatives that will help us to adapt to their impacts.  We have to rebuild the economy from here on in.  In doing that, we must ensure that we do not replicate the cycle we have had until recently where economic growth meant increased carbon emissions.  That was going to cost us in the long-run and it is something we need to think about now.  The type of growth we have in the future needs to be cleaner and involve fewer carbon emissions, less pollution and so on.The other side of this is to ensure that everything is influenced by the climate change legislation when it is enacted.  In the past we talked a good deal about protecting the environment.  However, in order to do so, the issue of climate change must be tackled as well.  We have moved away from the values we had heretofore regarding protecting the environment and many of the initiatives that were in place were good.  We tend to recycle more, something the Irish are good at, and this helps because if the habitat is protected, this helps to tackle climate change.  It is not just the environment.  Many of the initiatives needed to protect the environment and mitigate climate change are good in general for society.  Public transport infrastructure enables a more sustainable economy and that is good for people's quality of life.  It ensures affordable transport and also helps to tackle the problem of carbon emissions.If steps are taken to promote biodiversity and our habitats, they will become more robust in terms of adapting to climate change.  Protecting our habitats and encouraging biodiversity is something that needs to be done in itself.  Doing so will also help our habitats to adapt to climate change norms and become more robust in terms of whatever impacts occur.Regarding climate change adaptation, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has said there is to be a climate change strategy by the end of this year, and this is very important.  There is much talk now about the floods, climate change, etc.  I do not necessarily agree there is a link, but, in any event, we will have to deal with the impacts of climate change in the future.  There is a good deal of research which indicates that our climate is already changing.  There has been significant studies on how climate change will impact on Ireland.  Much of it has been carried out by NUI Maynooth and people such as Professor John Sweeney.  Some of the impacts of climate change in Ireland will not be that bad.  Some areas will do better than others, but many areas of activity will be under threat.  Some agricultural activity will be affected and some coastal areas.  We need a national plan for adapting to climate change, and this needs to be brought right down to local level.  The sooner that is done, the better.  It is very important that we do not just have a national climate change strategy and that each local authority, for example, has its own strategy.  Some of them do already, although most do not.We need to bring the impacts of adapting to climate change down to local community level, so that people are involved in doing something in their areas to deal with flooding, coastal erosion or whatever issues may arise from coastal change.  Local communities should be given leadership through the national climate change adaptation strategy.  In turn, they must prepare their own plans.  This needs to be done without delay.  Such initiatives have been carried out in places such as Washington State, I believe, and they tend to raise awareness among people about the issue of climate change and make them conscious of the need to reduce their carbon footprints.For some years we have been talking theoretically about reducing carbon emissions, but we have never really come up with concrete practical proposals which can be put in place at ground level.  We tend to talk in exalted terms about the Copenhagen conference and carbon emission targets.  There is much in this debate to which people on the ground cannot relate.  For example, one could involve children in projects to make schools more sustainable.  In so doing, one would educate children, their parents and teachers about the issues on climate change.  One could take actions such as making the buildings more energy efficient.  Alternatively, a school could have solar panels or save rainwater for subsequent use.  There are many things one could do in a school environment that could make a contribution to reducing our carbon emissions and help the awareness of children and the wider community of climate change.Similarly, one could think small in respect of public transport and achieve a lot simply by investing in more buses.  I have made this point many times.  While we tend to talk about projects such as the Luas, the metro and so on, I am uncertain of their future, given the current state of the economy.  However, buses are the most flexible form of public transport.  They are relatively cheap and one is not obliged to dig up roads to deploy additional buses.  One could take initiatives such as having cheaper fares in certain areas.   Much more could be done to get people out of their cars and into buses.These examples are a flavour of some of the steps that could be taken.  In addition to thinking big in respect of climate change legislation and targets, we should also think small by thinking about the small, practical things that could be done.While I acknowledge this issue is being considered in the drafting of legislation, it will be important for the future organisation of our society for us to deal with climate change in a way that will protect the poor and the vulnerable.  We must bring about greater equality in respect of people's income to help them deal with the issue of climate change.  The United Nations' reports have made the point that those who are poor are much more vulnerable to the impact of climate change.  Consequently, many of the suggestions made such as having environmentally-friendly cars and so on will be of no help to those who are poor.  If one deals with the fact that people are poor, one can help them to tackle better the issue of climate change.  This must be an important part of the debate.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	656	First, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject.  It is appropriate to do so on a day when Members have been debating a Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, in which much emphasis has been placed on flooding.  As this is deemed to be a symptom of climate change, it highlights the importance of this discussion.  In addition, today saw the launch of the report, Meeting Ireland's Electricity Needs post-2020.  I understand a report on greening the economy was published this morning also.  This issue must be considered in the context of something which must be done but which also presents opportunities.  After oil became a required energy source and when people in the Gulf states found they had oodles of it, they capitalised on it.  On its own, the report launched today on meeting Ireland's electricity needs highlights the country's potential, given its 140,000 square miles of ocean and water.  This resource has great potential in the fields of ocean, wind, wave and tidal energy.  However, although much research on that capacity and potential has been carried out here, mainly driven by the Marine Institute as regards offshore energy, another country would have tackled the impediments to developing such energy sources.  For example, one of the Irish companies which has developed advanced prototypes is going to carry out its final tests in Norway because it cannot secure connection to the grid.  We must consider the impediments to developing this raw resource we possess and which has great potential.  This must be done if we are to reach the requisite target, an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  In effect, this will be an energy-neutral lifestyle that will be sustainable by virtue of not taking from the planet but by recycling back into it the essentials — food, energy and medicines.  I acknowledge that medicines may have less of an impact.  The challenge to achieve this should be seen as an opportunity.I will turn to the first element which is highly relevant.  I am a member of both the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as is Deputy Aylward.  The emphasis on the agricultural impact on our greenhouse gas emissions per head of population is sometimes misconstrued.  Ireland has a high dependence on agriculture.  It has high agricultural output because this island of 6 million people is a bread basket that can feed 36 million people.  Ireland is one of the most carbon-efficient producers of food.  We are far more efficient, per unit of food, than any other country in Europe — New Zealand is probably the only country that can compare with us.  However, there are no standards of equivalence for proper comparisons.  This should be borne in mind before simply suggesting the number of cows must be cut to reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.  Ireland does not have heavy industry.  It lacks major coal and steel plants, iron ore plants or heavy industrial plants such as those that can be found on the River Rhine, for instance.  Consequently, this must be borne in mind.  Ireland has never had such industries and to return to 1990 emissions levels, we must reduce our emissions by 13%.  As the economy then was a fraction of its current level, we must think about how we can retain our current levels of economic development while meeting these targets.  This presents us with both a challenge and a great opportunity.As for research and development, if there is to be a carbon tax, the money should be recycled into stimuli that will reduce Ireland's carbon footprint, create jobs in the process and keep people at work.  If it can be ring-fenced to do this, it will save money, rather than pulling in money as a tax take, by putting people to work and keeping them there.  We should consider the issue in that context as there are great opportunities.  The all-party Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security produced the heads of a Bill.  The committee which is chaired by Deputy Barrett has worked in a non-confrontational all-party consensual manner since its inception and I implore those in power to bear this in mind when the committee produces reports.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	657	Earlier this year most people living in the counties now affected by serious flooding would have paid little attention to a person talking about climate change.  However, in recent months the effects of flooding have made people realise that change is happening.  I disagree vehemently with Deputy Tuffy who suggested climate change had little, if anything, to do with the flooding in many parts of the country.  As for the flooding and the climate change with which it definitely is associated, people may state this climatic cycle has only lasted for 200 years.  This raises the question of what will happen in parts of County Galway during the next 200 years.  The Stern report was produced in the context of the introduction of legislation in the United Kingdom on climate change.  It included one extremely important and striking statement to the effect that the cost of inaction was far greater than the cost of taking action now.  While this comment was made in a British context, it appears as though the Government and various Ministers have ignored such statements and warnings.  The Government would do well to take on board the point that investment is necessary now.  In Ireland reports are produced and then ignored.As for the flooding in County Galway, I note that €1.2 million was spent on the famous Peach report.  Every possible aspect of the environment in the south County Galway area, including the physical, social and wildlife environments, was investigated in great detail.  A cost-benefit analysis stated these were unimportant issues which would not affect justifying the expenditure involved.  Ten years later, massive flooding occurred again.  The cost of this flooding to the Government is an indication of the truth in that statement.  Galway was promised funds by various Deputies coming up to elections for action to alleviate the problem of flooding there.  However, it was forgotten soon afterwards.The ESB frustrates and stifles connectivity to the national grid for many potential wind energy producers which could increase the percentage of renewable energy used in the country.  The situation with regard to Gate 3 national grid connectivity projects is a classic example of how the ESB stifles these producers.  With the ESB and Airtricity in control, those wanting to invest in the provision of wind energy are forced to wait indefinitely until it suits these two players to allow them on the national grid.  I hope the Government will change the criteria under which the ESB allows connections to the national grid in the interest of climate change.  The opportunities in other areas of renewable energy production should not be postponed because of a repetition of such actions.Diversification in agriculture, such as the growing of bio-fuel crops, can also assist in reducing the effects of climate change.  Miscantis, for example, has huge potential as this country has very favourable growing conditions for it.  However, if we had 1,000 hectares of it tomorrow, we would not have the capacity to process it to our advantage.  Likewise, some years ago there was a run on rapeseed oil but Ireland had no capacity to process it to its advantage to reduce carbon emissions.  With a negative attitude in Government thinking, we will continue to lose out in time and opportunities in these areas.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	658	To reduce one's carbon footprint and tackle climate change means one must change the way one lives.  The first issue in this is about sustainable living, where we live and how we get to work.  It is about how our cities and towns are planned for sustainable development.  The Government needs to have more decisive thinking in planning legislation as to what is sustainable development.  There needs to be joined-up thinking for public transport, park-and-ride facilities on the outskirts of our cities and railway timetables.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Kennedy, knows as well as I do of the problems with the new Iarnród Éireann timetable for the northern commuter line.  It now takes longer to get to work for commuters on this line than it did 30 years ago.  If one wants to attract more users to public modes of transport, they must be good and enjoyable experiences.  Iarnród Éireann has good rolling stock but its timetables leave something to be desired.When developing our future towns and cities, we need to examine higher intensity rather than high rise development.  This does not mean where once there were two-storey houses, there should be 17-storey blocks.  Instead, we should be examining triplexes with zones moving from a city centre of lesser intensity but higher density development.  These should be developments which allow people to live with proper recreational spaces and facilities and travel to work on efficient public transport networks which are open to competitive choice.We cannot have a repeat of the awful urban sprawl of the Celtic tiger.  Vast areas of the country have been left with large housing estates with no schools, transport infrastructure or support services.  It means people need to use their car to commute, shop and travel.  In turn, their carbon emissions are high and they do not have a sustainable lifestyle.When it comes to choosing a house and getting to and from work, the order should be, first, by foot, second, by bike, third, by public transport and, fourth and last, by car.  Unfortunately, this has been the other way around in Ireland.  Some changes are being made to city transport.  I welcome the idea of bus-gates and pedestrianisation of town and city centres.  We must, however, continue to change people's mindsets to acknowledge they cannot drive their cars everywhere as it is simply unsustainable.I am critical of the Green Party's recent stance on nuclear energy.  In 2001, I marched with the great and the good, including the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, against the Sellafield plant.  We marched in the darkness of early morning and stayed there all day to protest against the facility's treatment of nuclear waste.  Deputy Gormley may remember when his mobile telephone gave out that I gave him mine so he could do an interview with RTE.  We stood firm that day and resolutely opposed to nuclear energy.I regret, however, that last week in the Dáil, having refused to answer my questions, the Minister chose to say he had an open mind on nuclear energy and he might change his mind, the futurum esse.  For a Green Minister to be about to change his mind on this matter is unacceptable.  The key problem with nuclear energy is that in the long run it is wasteful of our environment.  Other issues are nuclear terrorism and that the waste must be stored for 250,000 years until it is safe.  For example, the UK stores much of its nuclear waste underground in the Irish Sea.  Any tectonic activity over the next 250,000 years which may release that waste would have a direct impact on Ireland.While the Minister, Deputy Gormley, may not object to the necklace of nuclear plants facing Dublin and the east coast from the United Kingdom, I certainly do.  I challenge him to answer these charges in here, man to man.  How can one argue nuclear energy is sustainable when one considers the risks to life and the thousands of years of pollution it poses?  The carbon footprint cost in terms of the construction, manufacture and after-work required, including the decommissioning costs, is massive and in this regard the Minister's sums do not add up.Our energy future is in wind and wave energy and in research and development.  Deputy Coveney on behalf of Fine Gael has produced an important and costed programme in regard to our future energy needs and how we should deal with this issue.  The programme is also carbon friendly.  The key point is that we must change the way we think about our energy use, how we live and how we travel.  Hard questions must be asked.  I put the following idea for debate.  Other countries are examining the issue of road pricing.  If I drive my car from A to B, I burn up fuel, which does not reduce my carbon footprint.  There is a case to be made in respect of arterial routes in some countries, namely, motorways in France, for motorists to pay as they go whenever they enter a motorway.  In other words, the amount one pays in terms of road pricing is directly proportional to the distance travelled.  I believe there is equity in that proposal which should be considered.  Obviously, this is not a panacea for all ills.  I am not suggesting this be enforced on rural or regional roads.  If we are investing heavily in vehicular transport we must ensure motorists pay as they go in terms of carbon footprint.  I merely throw out this issue for discussion.What we need in our county councils are people charged specifically with achieving reductions in carbon footprints.  There should be in our councils a designated official who would advise schools, hospitals, industry and households on how they can reduce their carbon footprint.  We should have in place an information office whom people could contact to obtain advice in regard to changing how they live.  We have all the thinking in terms of Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, and so on but we need to bring this down to ground level where people live and work.  I believe the county councils have a particularly important and influential role to play in terms of providing an energy officer to advise constituents on how to reduce their carbon footprint.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	659	As the Minister, Deputy Gormley, stated at the outset, the Copenhagen conference is one of the most widely anticipated peace time events.  This anticipation reflects the seriousness of the threat presented by climate change and the urgency of reaching agreement on an effective global response.  I believe it is timely and useful to hear the views from both sides of the House and I welcome the strong support voiced for a positive outcome to the Copenhagen conference.In summary, we need and must press to reach agreement on a global and comprehensive legally binding treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol with effect from 2013.  There can be no gap in the international response to climate change and all parties, countries and elements must play their part.  Deputy Barrett referred to the fact that international action lags behind.  I believe everybody in the House agrees with him.  If we do not underpin the need for a new treaty that broadens the scope and effectiveness of the international response to climate change in the post-2012 period, we will not have served the needs of mankind at this time.It must be acknowledged that Ireland has fully and consistently supported the EU proactively and in its leadership in the international climate change process.  That position stands and we will play our part in seeking to influence a positive and effective outcome at Copenhagen.  A fully fledged legally binding agreement may not be possible.  It may take a little longer to get that result but the parties must take a significant incremental step towards that end.It has been interesting to hear the debate on all sides, informed to some extent by the effects of the flooding in recent weeks, initially more severe in the west and south and more recently in Kildare and surrounding counties.  People have been quick to point to some of the deficiencies that have led to the difficulties that have arisen.  It is important to point out that in virtually all of the areas which were badly affected, the level of rainfall was considerably higher than previous levels in those areas, in some instances dramatically higher, and not always over a wide area.  It is interesting that in County Clare we generally look to the weather results from Shannon.  Even though Ennis is only 15 miles from Shannon, the level of rainfall there was approximately 50% higher than in Shannon.  This was a factor in the difficulties which hit Ennis.  Subsequently, a much larger catchment along the Shannon basin right up to the northern end, including Leitrim to Limerick city, was affected.  All kinds of challenges are posed arising from this.  There is almost universal agreement that the extraordinary high levels of rainfall are an element of climate change.  This has occurred much sooner than many of us might have anticipated and is certainly much more dramatic than people were prepared for.On the other hand, it is true to say that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and various Ministers down through the years, back to pre-Kyoto times, have been considering ways to address the threats posed by climate change.  Many people who have considered the strategy put forward by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government seven or eight years ago are impressed by how well placed it was in terms of predicting what we needed to do.  Heretofore, the emphasis has tended to be on coastal communities and the likelihood that the melting of the polar ice-caps would raise sea levels.  There seems to be an indication that an interim problem is arising much sooner in terms of increased levels of rainfall.  Of course, what is impossible to predict is whether this incidence is likely to recur at long intervals, say, 60, 70 or 100 years or a new pattern that is likely to be repeated more frequently at, say, five, six, seven or ten-year intervals.  In either case, there is a particular challenge facing us.Many Deputies pointed to the level of building on flood plains.  There is no doubt that houses have been built in places previously flooded.  At the same time, on this particular occasion floods occurred in parts of the west never before flooded.  This must be taken into account in terms of future planning.  The type of flooding that occurs is very much influenced by the topography of an area and by geology.  In the Burren,  because of the underground systems of drainage, one cannot see where the rivers are.  It is difficult to know where the swallow holes and other geographical features are and, as such, it is difficult to predict where water may come up through the ground.  There are changing patterns in this regard as seen in the Ardrahan area of south Galway during the past week when seven or eight days after the heavy rainfall had stopped, flood levels rose dramatically in one particular area.  While these can drop off fairly quickly, winter water levels in the turloughs are likely to remain for several months, an issue which we must consider carefully.  Thankfully we have people who have a great deal of expertise in this area, including hydrologists and others, who have been of enormous assistance.The role played by the emergency services has been, in my experience, extraordinary.  People have worked 24 hours a day for several days to achieve a successful outcome to the challenge posed.Tomorrow I will be taking in the House the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2009 which seeks to transfer responsibility for foreshore in respect of major projects to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  That legislation brings together the planning function on land with planning functions on the foreshore.  This is an important precursor to addressing many of the issues we will face in terms of maritime and seaside defences, in particular in built-up areas which may be a lot nearer to many of us than we think.Deputy Ulick Burke, whose constituency was badly affected by the flooding, outlined the concerns people have and the received wisdom that places the blame for the flooding, to some extent, on planning decisions.  However, the level of rainfall was an enormous factor and there should be a general acknowledgement among the population that this is a function of climate change occurring more quickly than has been the case heretofore.  The mitigation measures outlined in the climate change strategy published by the Department some years ago showed a degree of foresight.  It is the type of strategy that is needed to address that area.Deputy Fergus O'Dowd concentrated on transport.  When one sees the levels of emissions from transport one must admit there is considerable urgency about dealing with that issue.  It seems likely that the resolution for the transport issue lies in two directions.  One, which the Deputy outlined in some detail, is public transport.  That is an important element, but in the backs of our minds we all hold the suspicion that western society, and particularly Irish society, has become wedded to the motor car.  According to the best current scientific knowledge, the way to enable that to continue in the future is to concentrate on electrically powered cars.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	661	Of course, a number of other issues will remain, particularly if the number of vehicles we currently use is maintained and there was a complete transfer to that.  The failure to put in place a strong public transport system would exacerbate the difficult situation with congestion, parking and other issues.  Notwithstanding that, however, a high proportion of the population is rurally based.  Even in the Acting Chairman, Deputy Michael Kennedy's, constituency, which is very near the city, there is a substantial rural area with small towns populated by people whose transport requirements are diverse.  They sometimes require their own transport.  In that situation it might be an enormous mistake to assume that our requirements for the provision of electricity will remain what they currently are.  One of the interesting aspects of our current requirement for electricity is that the requirement on the lowest electricity usage day in mid-July is just about 50% of the requirement on the day of the highest usage.  That is another challenge.  It means one must provide twice as much electricity at a particular time.The question of electricity generation is central to how we deal with climate change and our carbon emissions.  It is something we must examine carefully not only with regard to electricity usage for domestic, industrial and commercial purposes but also with regard to the burden that may arise in the provision of transport.  That is an immediate challenge which we must deal with very quickly.I am delighted the programme for Government has put such strong emphasis on the forestry sector.  It is a sector in which this country has enormous advantages.  We have, perhaps, a double advantage because our level of afforestation was relatively low in 1992 when Kyoto was agreed.  It has increased dramatically since then and, as a result, our capability for carbon sequestration is increased.  We had planting levels of approximately 20,000 hectares per annum ten years ago but it is down to approximately 6,000 hectares per annum now.  The programme for Government commits us to trying to increase it to above 10,000 hectares per annum.  If we reach our target by 2020 of having 17% of the country afforested, it would be necessary to plant 25,000 hectares per annum.  There is a strong case for arguing that it would be far better to invest resources in planting forestry, which has a carbon sequestration capability, than to spend it on carbon credits.  In so far as possible, the country's aim should be to minimise the amount expended on purchasing carbon credits and to try to provide by whatever means necessary for self-sufficiency in that regard.  Forestry is a very important element in that.We also tend to forget that there have been some very successful campaigns.  The Power of One campaign a few years ago, which was launched at a relatively early stage in people's consciousness of the impact of climate change, was driven by the Government and had a positive impact.  It showed it is possible to have successful campaigns of this nature.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Gormley, on his initiative on lightbulbs.  It was instructive to see some of the responses, which were extraordinarily negative and not based on the facts.I am also interested in the proposals coming from the Spirit of Ireland Group and its ideas, particularly for the generation of electricity.  The group has done a huge amount of work.  There are issues with access to the grid in some of the areas which have the most promising prospects.  Deputy Ring will be aware that some of them are in his constituency.  Fortunately, some of them are in mine and as there is a long history of electricity generation in Clare, there are very strong grid connections in the area, historically because of Ardnacrusha and more recently because of Moneypoint.  There are strong proposals for the creation of pump storage facilities.As Deputy O'Dowd said, there are many opportunities with regard to wind, wave and tidal energy.  There is much experimenting taking place and we are trying to stay to the forefront in that regard.  There are some great opportunities.  Sometimes we view climate change as an entirely negative story but there are some very positive elements and good prospects for people who are first with developments.  We are trying to develop that.

Seven have been built, the last one five years ago.  That is a very important point because unless we address the engineering, port facility and connectivity to grid issues, and if we continue to throw out unfounded and ill-conceived ideas, we will not progress this issue.  The debate in the House, in general, was marked by a willingness to engage with climate change issues, a capacity to understand what the threats to this country are and a capacity to see that there are opportunities.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for debate on the Adjournment.  The Minister will recall that in 2006 and 2007 there was very serious flooding in south Mayo.  A number of houses were flooded, as was shown on RTE at the time.  It was a terrible flood, particularly in the Roundfort-Hollymount area.Funding was provided last year but there was a major dispute about a report from the Office of Public Works, OPW, for the national parks and wildlife service.  This has been going on for 12 months.  Yesterday, I received a reply to a parliamentary question stating that the OPW report has been completed and has gone to the national parks and wildlife service.  I will not go over the top, but the family in question contacted me this week because it had to be evacuated from its home again three years on.  Once was enough.  Funding is in place but, because of disputes between two State agencies, the family's house has been destroyed again.  The Minister of State might not be able to confirm something for me now, but I hope he will over the next number of days, namely, whether the OPW will start the work early in the new year.  I tabled a question to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the NPWS to determine whether the latter is satisfied.Mayo County Council, the OPW and the NPWS are responsible for the home's flooding.  I met the NPWS in July and I asked it and the OPW, no matter the problems, to sit down and try to get the report done and the money spent before the winter season.  We waited and waited and I tabled question after question.  Lo and behold, nothing could be done until the house was flooded a second time.  Only then could everyone get together and get the report done.  I hold both agencies responsible for flooding the home.  If they had done what they were supposed to do, we would not have had this problem.Mayo County Council, the OPW and the NPWS told us for 15 years that the problem in Kilmaine could not be resolved.  Locals told them how to resolve it and a small amount of money got the job done.  This week, I was told by telephone that, despite all of the rain and flooding, not a bit of water had entered those people's lands or homes.The €200,000 was allocated by the Minister of State's Department.  I want it spent and the families protected.  If the money had been spent and they got flooded again, at least the Minister of State, his Department and the council would have tried.  The money was available, but two agencies instead fought over snipes and birds and showed no interest in families' homes.  I want the problem to be resolved.  I want the Minister of State to confirm in the House that he will take on this case personally, check it out and tell me that the work will start in the new year.  The NPWS will be happy with the Department's report.

The impact on communities has been severe.  Areas of south County Mayo, including Roundfort-Hollymount, also suffered badly from flooding in 2006.  I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to discuss in the House the serious flooding in the Roundfort-Hollymount area in the past week.The flooding, which has affected a house, agricultural land and the Hollymount-Tuam road, is a complex issue to deal with due to the nature of the terrain in the area.  A substantial part of the affected lands contains a number of interlinked turloughs.  These features are protected under the provisions of the EU habitats directive.  Any proposals for flood mitigation works or any works that would impact on the turloughs must have the consent of the NPWS of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Following the flooding in late 2006, the OPW drew up proposals to address the problem in Roundfort-Hollymount.  These involved extending the OPW's dredging operations into a channel in the area.  Although being a continuation of a channel forming part of the Corrib-Mask-Robe arterial drainage scheme, which is maintained by the OPW, it was not part of that scheme.  The work would be carried out under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.These proposals were distributed to landowners in the area at a meeting arranged by the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, in February 2008.  Mayo County Council was also consulted.  The complexity of the problem was recognised, including the view at the time of the need to balance mitigation measures with environmental constraints regarding water levels in the turloughs that would limit the extent of protection from flooding that could be provided.As is required, the OPW commissioned an ecological study regarding the environmental impacts of the proposals in March 2008.  The report of the outcome of this study was submitted to the NPWS in April 2008 for consent to proceed with the works.  The NPWS raised a number of issues and requirements.  It wanted a more detailed cost benefit analysis of the properties affected, an assessment of the impact on turloughs in the area using specified EU methodologies, a comprehensive examination of alternative solutions to addressing the problem, consultations with experts in turlough systems and an analysis of the frequency of the flooding.To address these concerns, the OPW extended the scope of the initial ecological study in May 2008.  The OPW also commissioned Dr. Roger Goodwillie, who is recognised as one of the foremost experts in the area of turloughs in Ireland, to examine the proposals.  Due to the complexity of the problem, the completion and synthesis of these studies took somewhat longer than anticipated.  As a result of the additional ecological studies, the OPW modified the original proposals for the works.  The modified proposals were submitted to the NPWS on 3 November 2009.  If the proposals meet with its approval, it would be the intention of the OPW to undertake the work as part of its 2010 works programme.As in the case of many of the OPW's proposals to carry out works, unexpected issues arise that are outside the direct control of the office.  Some of these issues relate to sensitive matters of an environmental or archaeological nature that must, under EU directives, be assessed by the appropriate authorities before works can proceed.  In the Roundfort-Hollymount situation, the OPW had no alternative but to refer the issues that arose to the NPWS.I assure the Deputy that the OPW will move ahead as quickly as possible with the works when they have been approved by that body.  Progress in this regard would be dependent on water levels in the river and environmental windows available for such works, which would have a significant impact on when the works could commence.  In the circumstances, it is unlikely that any substantive work will be done before next spring.In light of recent severe flooding over large parts of the country, a fundamental reappraisal needs to be undertaken of the appropriate balance between protecting people, homes and livelihoods and other important environmental considerations relating to habitats, wild life, rare plants, turloughs and other natural features.  While I am sure the different interests and priorities can be reconciled, I am firmly of the opinion that proper weight must be given to flood protection where people are concerned.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	677	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this important item on the Adjournment.  In recent weeks, much media attention and Government time was taken up by the difficult situations that the latter needed to deal with in the major crisis areas of Galway, Clare, Limerick, the west and even parts of my constituency.  Lost in all of this were the many small projects with which local councils had difficulties, namely, flooding on small country roads.  I am referring to a small amount of attention in terms of laying a pipe, dredging or patching.  The Minister of State well knows what I have in mind.  At places like Lagganstown, Golden, Knockavilla, Dualla and Ardfinnan in the Care rural area, the Clonmel rural area, Fethard, Carrick-on-Suir and west Tipperary, several roads were blocked by ponds.  Cars found the going difficult because of the resting water.  Urgent action is required.  I visited the sites with council engineers.  I have been in contact with other engineers.  The answer I get each time from members and staff of South Tipperary County Council is that the job needs to be done.I ask the Minister of State and his Government colleagues, including the Minister for Transport, to make funding available for such schemes.  I suggest that a block grant of some description could be provided.  I am sure money can be found in some Department to help these people.  As it is early December, we have a long winter ahead of us.  Local authorities have the manpower to do these small jobs but they have no money.  I ask the Government to make an allocation to every local authority in the country.  There is a list in every local authority.  I wish to be helpful by saying that the full co-operation of Members is not in doubt.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has the ear of the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  He has seen at first hand the problems I have mentioned which need to be dealt with.  I respectfully ask the Minister of State to ensure funding is made available to the local authorities in question.  He might not be able to respond to that request tonight but he can do so in the weeks ahead.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	678	I thank Deputy Tom Hayes for raising this matter, which relates to the constituency we share.  I visited Lagganstown, which was mentioned by the Deputy, last Saturday.  I express my sympathy to those who have been affected by the recent flooding in many parts of the country, including County Tipperary.In September 2004, the Government confirmed that the Office of Public Works is the State's lead agency in dealing with flooding.  It is tasked with delivering an integrated and multifaceted programme that is aimed at mitigating future flood risk and impact.  The repair and improvement of regional and local roads following flooding is a matter for the relevant local authority, to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants paid by the Department of Transport.  The initial selection of works to be funded from such grants is also a matter for each local authority.  The funding of national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority.  When grants for regional and local roads are allocated at the beginning of each year.  The Department of Transport does not hold back a reserve allocation at central level to deal with weather contingencies as such an arrangement would involve a reduction in the allocations that are made.  Instead, the allocation made to local authorities is inclusive of the weather risk factor and local authorities are expressly advised to set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.  This stipulation is clearly set out in the circular letter that is sent with the yearly road grant allocations.Grants totalling €447.477 million were allocated to local authorities for works on regional and local roads in 2009.  This allocation included a discretionary maintenance grant of €29.56 million and a discretionary improvement grant of €12.5 million.  These moneys are available at the discretion of county councils to fund contingency works arising from weather conditions.  The Department of Transport is prepared to consider sympathetically any request from local authorities to adjust their multi-annual restoration programmes or revise their specific grant applications to prioritise work necessitated by severe weather conditions.  Local authorities have been allocated a total of €144.951 million in restoration improvement grants and €85 million in restoration maintenance grants in 2009.  Local authorities are continuing to assess the extent of flood damage in their regions.  It will be some time before they can quantify the damage sustained to regional and local road networks.  More time will pass before repair works can be costed.Deputy Tom Hayes will appreciate that neither I nor the Minister for Transport can indicate at this time what funding might be needed or available to address damage caused to the regional and local road network.  Officials in the Department of Transport are maintaining contact with local authorities affected by flooding.  The current difficulties faced by those authorities are being monitored and will be taken into account in the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations to the extent that resources will allow.  As a Deputy who shares the Tipperary South constituency with Deputy Hayes, I am glad that many road maintenance improvements that have been undertaken by South Tipperary County Council in 2009, many of them on roads between his house and mine.  I am certain the council will give priority, within the funds available, to the repair of road structures that were damaged by recent heavy rains and flooding in certain parts of the county.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	679	I am delighted to get a chance to speak on this subject, which I honestly did not think would arise again.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and I had some heated debates about stag hunting two or three years ago.  The Minister insisted that certain regulations be put into place.  For example, it is now necessary for three officials from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to monitor stag hunting.  The Minister is aware that this system has worked well.  Has he received any complaints about anything going wrong in this regard?  While I accept that every party has its own programme for Government, I do not understand why the hunt is being targeted.  Attempts are being made to ban a sporting activity that has contributed a great deal to this country.The Ward Union Hunt has been in existence for 155 years, which makes it 30 years older than the GAA.  People like Paul Carberry, Philip Carberry, Nina Carberry, Peter John Carberry, Ross Geraghty, Barry Geraghty, Robbie Power, Adrian Maguire and Norman Williamson, who are household names in this country, are among the progeny of the Ward Union Hunt.  New names like Andrew Duff, Charles Greene, Keith Donohue, Megan Carberry and Donie Fahy are also among the progeny of the hunt, as are horse trainers like Noel Meade, Tommy Carberry, John Carr, Gordon Elliott, Tony Martin, Pat Rooney, Kieran Cromwell, James Halpin and Ronan O'Dwyer.The Ward Union Hunt is the last stag hunt in the world.  It is an iconic representation of rural life in Ireland.  It has in excess of 200 members, more than 170 of whom ride out.  Its premises, including its kennels, are regularly inspected by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which ensures the health of the pack and the deer is maintained.  An official report has confirmed that hunting does not affect the short-term or long-term health of mature male deer.  The hunt provides an essential knackery service, including a collection facility for fallen stock, to local farmers.  The knackery is licensed by the Department, which visits it every day.  The Ward Union Hunt raises between €50,000 and €100,000 for charity every year, even in bad times.  The hunt maintains a carefully monitored breeding programme to protect and preserve the Irish red deer.  It has been suggested that the hunt should be allocated funding to preserve and guarantee this aspect of Ireland's heritage.  It is estimated that the hunt contributes up to €1.6 million to the Exchequer every year.  It costs the hunt approximately €6,700 per annum to keep a horse.  That money is spent in the local area, benefitting vets, farriers, feed merchants and saddlers, etc.  The hunt directly employs four full-time staff.The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has made it a personal mission to target the Ward Union Hunt.  In all his years in government, however, he has never taken the time to sit down with representatives of the hunt.  Why is this the case?  It is certainly not for the want of opportunity.  Every rural Deputy in this House understands the importance of hunting and rural sports for local communities.  Hunting is worth €111 million to the Exchequer every year.  If it is not the case that the Minister is trying to rush an amendment through the House, why have the members of the Ward Union Hunt received a letter requesting a regulatory impact analysis?  I suggest that has been done in advance of the introduction of legislation banning stag hunting.  Why would the Minister ask for the opinion of the only remaining stag hunt in the world, when he has already guaranteed his party that a ban will happen?  He has added insult to injury.  The Minister's letter of last week asked for a reply by Friday, 13 December 2009, but there is no such date.  Perhaps someone will rectify that.The Minister seems to be obsessed with the plight of the red deer in Leinster, but why is the same courtesy not being afforded to the red deer in Connacht?  Can the Minister confirm that a number of complaints have been received by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to the effect that authorised officers from the Department are involved in the commercial exploitation of wildlife in the west?  I have it on very good authority that red deer in Connacht are being hunted and shot for up to €5,000 per head.  This is well known to the Minister and the proof of it is in his Department.Why has a commencement date not been set for section 36 of the Wildlife Act during the past nine years?  Such a commencement date would preclude any citizen from engaging in the commercial exploitation of wildlife without a licence, but a date has never been set.  This means that anybody can host hunting parties for profit in Ireland.With things the way they are, I do not know why the Minister is doing this.  What he did two years ago has worked very well and he knows that, although I did not like it at the time.  The Ward Union Hunt was the first to admit the new regulations put in place by the Minister and the people he appointed have worked very well.As a Deputy, I will oppose this.  It took the Labour Party in England 600 hours in the Houses of Parliament to get its anti-hunting ban through.  It took it ten hours to get approval for the invasion of Afghanistan.  If it takes 600 hours in this House, I will do everything to protect rural life in Ireland.

The renewed programme for Government includes a commitment to ban the practice of stag hunting.  I should explain that under existing wildlife legislation I can, as Minister, issue a licence for the hunting of deer by a pack of hounds.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, there is now only one hunt club in the State which continues to hunt deer using a pack of hounds and horses.  I have issued a licence to this hunt club to hunt deer with a pack of hounds for the 2009-2010 season which ends on 31 March 2010.However, I continue to believe that this particular hunting practice should cease for animal welfare and public safety reasons.  I believe a large proportion of the public consider such activity is no longer acceptable.  The Deputy may recall an incident a few years ago when a deer pursued by a pack of hounds entered a school yard during the school day.  I find an incident like this totally intolerable.  Since then, there have been other public safety incidents involving deer in flight leaping through hedges onto public roads.  Therefore, I recently obtained Government approval to the drafting of legislation to prohibit the hunting of deer by a pack of stag hounds.  This legislation will not have any implications for other activities such as fox-hunting, hare coursing or the shooting of deer.  This new legislation will also allow for regulations to control recreational activities, to address invasive species and to increase the penalties under the Wildlife Acts.There is a need to regulate certain recreational activities in ecologically sensitive areas.  This is in response to a judgment of the European Court of Justice which found that Ireland had failed to transpose adequately Article 6(2) of the habitats directive in the field of recreational activities.  Certain, currently unregulated activities, such as the use of quad-bikes, scramblers or jet-skis in inappropriate locations, have resulted in serious ecological damage, including degradation and erosion of upland habitats and the destruction of the breeding sites of protected water birds.  This problem must be urgently addressed if Ireland hopes to avoid further litigation at the European Court of Justice and the imposition of heavy fines.I refer to what are termed "invasive alien species".  These are plants and animals which, if released to the wild either by accident or on purpose, have the potential to cause substantial economic damage as well as damage the natural biodiversity of the country.  Examples we all know include the grey squirrel, muntjac deer, zebra mussel and the African pondweed, which is choking Lough Corrib.  Increased powers are required to enable us to take the necessary steps to regulate the import, sale and dispersal of these undesirable animal and plant invasive species and to take appropriate steps, if possible, to eradicate them or minimise the threat that they pose.The legislation will increase the maximum fines that could be imposed on a person following a conviction for an offence under the Wildlife Act.  The penalties were last increased in 2000. For example, the current maximum fine of £500 will be increased to €1,000 while the £50,000 will increase to €100,000.  It is my intention to publish the legislation as soon as possible.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	681	I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to raise this matter which is of great importance in my constituency.  It is also significant for the people of Dublin and nationally.  It relates to the implications of the decision by Dublin City Council, through public private partnership, to commence the construction of an incinerator in the Poolbeg area on 14 December.I am more than disappointed with the Minister, Deputy John Gormley's behaviour concerning this proposed incinerator in the past two years since he entered the Department of the Environment.  When he took up office, I had high hopes and expectations.  The high standards he set for his predecessor in Government in our mutual constituency, the then Minister, Michael McDowell, made it very clear that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, expected nothing less from Mr. McDowell, as a member of Cabinet, than to put a stop to the proposed incinerator.  In March 2005, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, said the time had come for the Minister to stop bleating and deliver to his constituents as promised.It is clear to me there is more than one sheep in Dublin South-East because there has been plenty of bleating from this Minister over the course of the past two years and many years prior to that when he was a very vocal and outspoken Opposition Deputy who was clearly opposed to this incinerator.  It is a pity that the high standards the Minister set for the former Minister when he was in office appear not to apply to him in his high office now.He has had two opportunities.  The first was in the original programme for Government which was negotiated in 2007.  I put it on the record then and I called on the Minister to seek agreement from his colleagues in Cabinet to commit to stopping the incinerator at Poolbeg.  He failed to do so, but he had a second opportunity some months ago.  Again, I hoped and expected that something would be achieved on that occasion, but, yet again, no agreement was secured at Cabinet level.  On two occasions the Minister has failed the people of Dublin South-East and has failed me as his colleague because I held him in very high regard.On 26 November, the company which was contracted to build the incinerator, Covanta Europe, lodged a notice with Dublin City Council to begin construction.  The plan is to start on 14 December.  I would like to know what the Minister plans to do about this.  There were plenty of reports in the media in recent weeks stating that Dublin City Council has threatened legal action against the Government if it acts to interfere with the process as set out by the council.  Has the Minister given any consideration to whether there is an opportunity for the Government to initiate legal proceedings, for example, with an injunction to prevent this preposterous monstrous incinerator from going ahead?  Has he consulted the Attorney General?I reiterate my point.  The approval to build this incinerator will create a monster.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, was very vocal on this issue until 2007 when he became a member of the Cabinet.  It is intended that the incinerator will have the capacity to burn 600,000 tonnes of waste on an annual basis.  That is far too much.  The report carried out by An Bord Pleanála inspector recommended to the board that the capacity of this incinerator should be reduced and, at very minimum, that it should not go ahead as a 600,000 tonne-eating furnace in its proposed format.  That was ignored by the board of An Bord Pleanála.If we are to take the Minister seriously in his role, both as a constituency Deputy for Dublin South-East and as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, surely the blatant and flagrant ignoring of the recommendations of the internal inspector's report to An Bord Pleanála merited investigation by him.  The Minister had the power and authority to do this but failed to act.  I am very disappointed by that.  The Minister is in the process of appointing somebody to initiate a review under the powers afforded to him by section 224 of the Local Government Act.  Clearly, however, this is an investigation that will be carried out after the horse has bolted.  According to a response the Minister gave less than two weeks ago to a parliamentary question I tabled, he had not appointed anybody to carry out the review at that point.  I am not aware that he has appointed anybody since then.  He may enlighten the House now.  Does the Minister propose to appoint somebody after the trucks have trundled down to Poolbeg to begin construction?  Will it be in January after the foundations have been laid?I do not understand the Minister's motive or purpose, which appears to be futile.  If something is not done before 14 December, we can hang up our boots and regard the development as going ahead.  That the Minister has failed to address this is a shocking indictment of him, bearing in mind that he has been in one of the highest offices in the land for more than two years.The Irish Waste Management Association agrees with my point on this matter.  Any objective observer will see quite clearly that, by having an incinerator of this magnitude, we are disincentivising recycling and waste reduction and negating all the values the Minister's party and he, as its leader, have espoused for many years.  That is very disappointing.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	682	I was on a television programme some nights ago being harangued by members of Fine Gael who were telling me I should do more about floods.  In the audience was a Fine Gael councillor who had rezoned land in a flood plain.  I now feel like I did on that night because, as Deputy Creighton will know, it was her party that introduced the legislation to provide for incineration and her party, along with other Opposition parties, that voted for this proposal in 1998.  Those are the facts and the difficulties with which I must deal.As the Deputy is aware, waste management infrastructure projects are advanced by private sector service providers or by local authorities.  It is a matter for the promoters of such projects to seek and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, i.e. planning permission and a waste licence.  In carrying out their functions, planning authorities, including An Bord Pleanála, and the EPA in regard to waste licensing, act independently of the Minister.  Similarly, the commencement notice is a matter for the local authority concerned and its private partner.Since taking office, I have continually stressed my twin environmental priorities of dealing with climate change issues and ensuring that we make the necessary quantum leap in how we manage our waste.  We must explore the full range of technical solutions in addition to modifying our behaviour in support of sustainable waste management.  Undue emphasis on incineration as the cornerstone of waste management policy is detrimental to the development of alternative solutions and the transition to sustainable management of waste and resources.  In particular, I am concerned that the provision of excess incinerator capacity can create an economic incentive to send waste to incineration which could effectively have been dealt with by reuse or recycling.As a first step in my approach to modernising and reorienting the waste management sector, I arranged for an international consortium of consultants to undertake a comprehensive study on the waste sector, to cover a wide range of issues which will help identify how best to proceed with further efforts to reduce waste levels, improve recycling rates and deliver equitable and cost-effective waste management solutions.  On 19 November, I published the consultants' report.  This will be the launching pad for the policies we now need to mark a new departure in our approach to waste management.I am discussing with my colleagues in Government proposals to give effect to recommendations of the waste management policy review which will, inter alia, ensure the proper ordering of the waste collection and wider waste management market.  I want to provide certainty for those in the waste management sector and a framework within which the necessary legislative changes can be brought forward.The quantities of residual waste currently being collected by the Dublin local authorities would not be sufficient to meet the put-or-pay requirement in the incinerator contract into which Dublin City Council has entered.  We have recently seen further increases in recycling rates in Dublin with a corresponding drop in residual waste volumes.  Importantly, the recommendations of the report published on 19 November, which I intend to implement, will have the effect of further reducing the volumes of residual waste generated and driving more waste towards recycling.I am, therefore, concerned that the proposed incinerator will prove to be seriously oversized and that a liability for the ratepayer and taxpayer may ultimately arise.  Dublin City Council is in a 25-year contract in regard to the incinerator and any liability is, therefore, potentially very substantial.  In these circumstances, I have decided that the most appropriate course of action is to appoint an authorised person under section 224 of the Local Government Acts to conduct a full review of the financial implications of the project for the State in the event that the incinerator is oversized vis-à-vis the quantities of residual waste available in the Dublin area and the quantities controlled by Dublin City Council.

This commitment takes into account, inter alia, that there would be negligible negative impacts on the economy or on the level of competition and, having regard to the specific attributes and nature of the work involved, it is subject to consistency with EU competition rules.I intend to give effect to this commitment in the legislation being prepared in the context of a review of competition law generally, the proposed merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency and the Report of the Media Merger Advisory Group.  Work on the Heads of a Bill is at an advanced stage and I plan to bring proposals to Government early next year.  I expect that the Bill will be published during the course of 2010.

The Agreement (para 9.4) also commits the Government to bringing forward legislative proposals to prohibit the victimisation of trade union members and to prohibit the incentivisation of persons not to be members of a trade union.With a view to progressing work on both commitments, a Review Group  — chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and on which my Department; the Department of Finance; trade unions; and employers are represented — has been put in place to examine these issues.Two informal meetings of the Group have taken place and position papers have been submitted by the employer and trade union representatives on the issues requiring the Group's consideration.  I understand that the Group's work will now focus on the issues raised in these position papers and that further engagement between the parties is anticipated over the coming weeks.  The Group has not set a date for the completion of its activities.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	685	As at 30.11.09, there have been 37 workplace deaths reported to the Health and Safety Authority. In the years 2002-2008, the numbers were as follows—  57 in 2008;  67 in 2007;  51 in 2006;  74 in 2005;  50 in 2004;  68 in 2003, and  61 in 2002.Non-fatal accidents, resulting in an absence of more than three days from normal work following the accident, are required to be reported to the Authority. There have been 5,850 non-fatal work related accidents reported to the Authority to date in 2009 (as at 30.11.09).  There were 6,998 in 2008, 7,816 in 2007, 7,844 in 2006, 8,104 in 2005, 8,453 in 2004, 6,622 in 2003, and 7,746 in 2002.  These figures add up to a lot of pain and loss for those involved and their immediate families and dependants and also to significant lost productivity.Many accidents are preventable.  Many occur because of lack of thought as to safety of oneself or others.  The basic procedures as regards workplace safety are often ignored.  These relate to the identifying and assessment of risk followed by the putting in place of a system to minimise that risk.In 2008, 75% of employers inspected had a safety statement prepared and 53% of the assessed safety statements were in full or broad compliance.Workplaces can ultimately only be made safe by those who control and work in them.  The State's involvement is via the Health and Safety Authority which is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the occupational health and safety code.Its current Programme of Work, which lists a comprehensive range of activities to help make workplaces safer, contains a good balance between prevention, advice and enforcement and, to date this year, the programme is being implemented on schedule.It is planned to continue in this vein in 2010 with a focus on the high-risk sectors of agriculture and construction.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	686	I established a short-time working training programme after the April 2009 Budget, which is training people who are on systematic short time for the days they are not working.  The training lasts for a year and individuals retain their social welfare entitlements while on the programme.The number of people currently participating on this Programme is 156.  I understand from FÁS that they are in the process of filling the remaining places up to a total of 277.My Department has examined the German approach to short time working measures.  In Germany these measures allow companies to temporarily reduce or suspend activity and prevents individuals from being made redundant by their employers during difficult trading periods.Under the German schemes employers can in the case of a temporary, unavoidable loss of employment due to economic factors, apply to the State for a subsidy.  Under the scheme the State pays 67% of the lost wages for workers with dependent children and 60% for those without.  These measures will cost the German Exchequer approximately €2.1 billion this year.In examining the German scheme, it should be noted that Irish employees on short time working are entitled to claim Job Seekers Benefit or Allowance for the days they are not working.The Government also recognised the need to implement a scheme aimed at supporting vulnerable but viable enterprises and importantly retain jobs in these difficult economic times.  We therefore earlier this year launched the Employment Subsidy Scheme.  The scheme provides a subsidy of €9,100 over 15 months to qualifying enterprises in order to retain a number of employers.The Government recently announced that there will be a second broader call for applications with extended eligibility criteria, which will be open to all firms (except those in the agriculture and fisheries sectors) who employ a minimum of 10 employees and are facing financial difficulty.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to manage the scheme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	687	This Government recognises the critical importance of reducing business costs at this time, when all sources of efficiency are in focus and when jobs are at stake in all sectors of the economy. Restoring cost competitiveness is a vital part of driving export led growth.Under the Framework for Economic Renewal we are taking a number of measures across Government to improve our competitiveness.  Cost competitiveness has been a particular focus of attention and we are already seeing results.Both the NCB Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers' Indices have shown a sustained and deep period of declining input costs for businesses in Ireland, driven, in part, by lower wage costs.  This is matched by a decline in Irish inflation that reached minus 6.6 per cent in the year to October 2009 — the sharpest fall in Ireland since the 1920s.We have also seen a decline in unit labour costs, which has a direct effect on competitiveness. We continue to exert further downward pressure on costs, including progressing those recommendations of the Competition Authority that have most effect on competitiveness.  We have taken action on energy costs, public sector wage costs, and we have been actively progressing recommendations to increase competition and remove anti-competitive restrictions in the sheltered sectors of the economy.  These include competition in transport, pharmacy services and rent.  In addition, we are working to ease costs to enterprise in administered sectors of the economy under state control such as local authority charges.  We are also easing the administrative burden that regulations can create.The ESRI recently predicted that, with our current control of costs, productivity should grow by over 3 per cent in 2010. Combined with projected wage decreases of 2.5 per cent, this represents a significant improvement in the competitiveness of the Irish economy.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	689	The latest figures available relate to the period up to end October 2009 and indicate that the number of redundancy claims on hand and awaiting processing stands at 43,826.  I should point out that my Department has, since January to October 2009, already processed 38,149 claims and made corresponding payments totalling €248m which results in average weekly payments to the value of €6m being issued.My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums payable to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted by post from March 2009 and those filed online from April 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 8 to 9 months depending on the manner of filing the application.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first ten months of 2009 at 67,207.  This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 51.5 although the Section is currently carrying two vacant positions which are due to be filled;the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	691	As I have previously outlined to the House on a number of occasions over recent months, in supporting small and medium enterprises, the Government's focus has been on actions to sustain a positive business environment, including the proper functioning of the banking system, allied with specific targeted supports for SMEs through my Department's enterprise development agencies.Developments in the financial sector and wider economy during the last year have, in particular, broadened the concerns for SMEs in relation to gaining access to finance and bank credit.My Department and I have held regular meetings with the representative bodies of the SME sector and other stakeholders in relation to issues impacting on the sector.  I established the Roundtable on Access to Bank Credit and subsequently the Credit Supply Clearing Group with a dedicated e-mail contact point on my Department's website, to specifically deal with access to bank credit issues.The Government has focused on creating a fit for purpose banking system and taken actions to sustain the banks and facilitate the flow of credit to the wider economy.  The Bank Guarantee Scheme, the Banks' Recapitalisation Scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the passing of the NAMA Act are all aimed at this.  The NAMA Act has been further strengthened by the Government amendment providing the Minister for Finance with a power to issue guidelines, to the participating institutions in the NAMA process, on lending practices and procedures to improve the flow of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises and, if necessary, to other sectors.Under the Recapitalisation Scheme, additional measures were introduced to support SMEs including a commitment to increase lending capacity to SMEs by 10%; the establishment of a €100m environmental and clean energy innovation fund by each bank; the contribution of a further €15 million by each bank to new or existing seed capital funds; the introduction of the banks' Code of Conduct on Business Lending to SMEs, and the undertaking of an Independent Review of Bank Lending by Mazars published last July.  A second Review of Bank Lending again by Mazars is currently nearing completion and will also be published shortly.In the context of access to finance, Irish Banks have drawn down European Investment Bank (EIB) funding for loans for SMEs.  In 2009, the EIB made €300 million available to Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and Ulster Bank for onward lending to SMEs carrying out investment projects.  This was additional to €50 million previously made available to Bank of Scotland Ireland through its UK parent.  My colleague, Billy Kelleher, Minister for Trade And Commerce, met with representatives of these four banks last week to discuss progress on the take up of these funds.  The banks have confirmed that significant approvals have already been made to clients in respect of these funds and the funds should be substantially committed by the first quarter of 2010.  The banks are actively promoting their availability through their business managers and other contacts.  It is likely that Banks are also promoting new lending products to SMEs as evidenced by recent press and TV advertisements.Within my own Department, the enterprise development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the County and City Enterprise Boards continue to assist enterprises through their grant and advisory schemes.  Significant allocations were made in my Department's Estimates for 2009 to sustain the work of the development agencies.  I refer particularly to the Enterprise Stablisation Fund and the Employment Subsidy Scheme.Government has also introduced formal arrangements to reduce the payment period by central Government Departments to their business suppliers from 30 to 15 calendar days.  This commitment has effect on all valid invoices received on and from 15 June 2009 and is helping cash flow difficulties for enterprises.SMEs are central to our economic development and the range of measures and supports in place will continue to help the sector adapt to the current economic climate.  The services provided by the enterprise development agencies are kept under review and will be adjusted to respond to the current economic situation.I am prepared to consider any proposals for further supports for the SME sector.  Factors that have to be taken into account in considering any loan guarantee proposal include the likely cost to the taxpayer and the extent to which such schemes in other jurisdictions have actually increased lending.

Training in managing state agency performance is provided to departmental staff dealing with monitoring compliance with the code of practice.

The appointments will be made as soon as practicable when the Act has come into force.The Labour Services (Amendment) Bill, 2009 provides for a stronger governance and accountability structure at the State's employment and training agency.  It takes account of the recommendations contained in the Fourth Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts on Special Report 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the FÁS 2007 Accounts.  In relation to the appointment and operation of a new board for FÁS it provides for:a reduction in the size of the Board of FÁS from seventeen to eleven consisting of a Chair and 10 ordinary members (including the Director General of FÁS);appointments to be made on the basis of ability and experience;the introduction of a rolling system of appointments to the Board of FÁS;a limitation of membership of the board to 2 terms of not more than five years each;the removal of the automatic right to nominate individuals for appointment to the Board of FÁS from bodies not directly accountable to the taxpayer;the disclosure by directors of any conflict of interest and the banning of their involvement on matters where they have any such conflict.In anticipation of the enactment of the Bill, I recently arranged for the placing of an advertisement calling for expressions of interest from suitably qualified people for appointment to the Board of FÁS. Any person who had already submitted an expression of interest prior to the publication of the advertisement was not required to submit a further expression of interest.  The advertisement specified that, in order to qualify for appointment, a person must not have any conflicts of interest likely to interfere with his/her ability to play a full part on the Board. He/She must also have experience of and expertise in one or more of the following areas:the functions of FÁS, orfinance, trade, commerce, corporate governance or public administration.By the closing date of 30th November over 100 expressions of interest in appointment to the Board had been received. The appointments to the Board will be made in consultation with the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.

The Authority addresses its recommendations to any Government Department or body with responsibility for the sector as appropriate.Following on from the commitment made in December 2008, a prioritised list of existing Competition Authority recommendations, based on their impact on competitiveness, was drawn up by my Department.  Recommendations contained in the National Competitiveness Council's Annual Competitiveness Report and various OECD reports also informed the selection of recommendations for inclusion in this prioritised list.I have received the views of the relevant Government Ministers on how these recommendations, insofar as they relate to their Departments, can be progressed and I intend to bring an update to Government shortly on the progress achieved to date.A whole of Government response to any recommendations contained in future reports drawn up by the Competition Authority will be published within nine months in line with the original commitment in the Smart Economy document.

Under the scheme, Enterprise Ireland may provide up to €500,000 to viable companies with robust business models that are facing difficulties as a result of the current economic environment.  The fund supplies direct financial support to internationally trading enterprises that are investing in cost reduction or other measures to gain sales in overseas markets.Enterprise Ireland has approved approximately €56 million of which €50 million will be paid out this year.  To date, €42 million has been paid to applicants under this fund.  Enquiries have also been received from a further 100 companies.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	698	I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 72 together.The proposal for a Consumer Rights Directive was published in October 2008 and brings together in updated and consolidated form four existing Directives on doorstep selling, distance sales, consumer sales and guarantees, and unfair contract terms.  Unlike the Directives it is intended to replace, the proposal has been drafted on a full harmonisation basis and, if adopted on this basis, would preclude member states from going beyond its protections in national legislation.In the case of a complex proposal like the proposed Consumer Rights Directive, arriving at an overall assessment of its implications for consumer rights is not a straightforward matter.  Some proposals, such as the proposed extension of the withdrawal period for distance and off-premises contracts from seven to fourteen days and the provision that risk would pass with delivery in consumer sales contracts, would enhance Irish consumer rights.  Other provisions, such as those on unfair contract terms, broadly reflect the existing legal position here and would neither enhance nor diminish consumer rights.Concerns about the proposal's impact for consumer rights in Ireland centre mainly on its provisions on consumer remedies for faulty goods and, in particular, on their implications for what is known as the right to reject.  By this is meant the right to return faulty goods, obtain a refund of the price, and, in so doing, to terminate the contract.  This is a well-established feature of Irish sale of goods law and, though qualified by quite complex provisions on the acceptance and rejection of goods, is an important safeguard for consumers and one that materially strengthens their hand in dealing with recalcitrant traders.Though the proposed Directive makes provision for a broadly similar right to rescind the contract where goods are faulty, this applies only where the primary remedies of repair or replacement are unlawful, impossible or disproportionate, or are not made available by the trader, or fail to remedy the defect within a reasonable time or without significant inconvenience to the consumer, or if the same defect recurs more than once within a short period of time.  A fully harmonised provision along these lines would, if adopted, mean that the right to reject would be a remedy of second rather than first resort for faulty goods.The Sales Law Review Group, which I established in November 2008, in order, among other things, to assess the implications of the proposed Directive for Irish consumer rights and law, produced a comprehensive assessment of the proposal in a position paper published in July.  Though the Review Group acknowledged the positive elements in the proposal, it stated that the provisions on remedies for faulty goods and a related provision that would reduce the liability period for faulty goods under Irish law from six to two years presented "the greatest threat to the protections currently enjoyed by Irish consumers".  My Department has taken careful note of the points made by the Review Group and the Group's assessment has been of considerable benefit in informing our approach to the discussions on the proposed Directive.I would like to assure the Deputy that my officials have expressed our concerns at EU Working Groups about the relevant aspects of the proposed Directive in clear and forthright terms.  We will have the opportunity to restate them at political level in a policy debate on the proposed Directive at tomorrow's Competitiveness Council.It is important to recognise however that discussions on the proposed Directive have a considerable way to go at both official and Ministerial level.  The European Parliament is also set to begin its detailed examination of the proposal in spring 2010.  While I am not in a position to disclose the state of play of discussions on the proposed Directive, I can say that the European Commission is fully aware of our and other member states' concerns about aspects of the proposal.  In an address to the European Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee in March, the Consumer Commissioner, Meglena Kuneva, stated that the proposed Directive "does not force Member States to give up their general contract law remedies in the case of faulty goods, for example the right to reject faulty goods..."  She acknowledged the "understandable and legitimate concerns about crucial issues" in member states, including the provisions on remedies and the liability period for faulty goods.  The Commissioner concluded by stating that she was "ready to work further on these questions" and that "it may be that certain consumer rights need to be reinforced.".
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	699	The Government have adopted a co-ordinated, integrated and innovative approach to support the unemployed and to provide these individuals with the necessary skills needed to prepare them for a return to employment as soon as possible.  This process is being co-ordinated by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal, which contains Ministerial representatives of the key economic Government Departments.  As a result of this process significant progress is being made in a number of specific areas between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.The capacity of the job search supports system provided by FÁS Employment Services and the partnership-based Local Employment Service has been almost doubled the annual capacity of places to 147,000 for National Employment Action Plan referrals by the Department and Social and Family Affairs.  The National Employment Action Plan process is now under review between the two Departments to see if improvement can be made for the future.Earlier this year Minister Hanafin and I launched the Work Placement Programme and the Short Time Training Programme.  The Work Placement Programme is providing 6 months work experience for 2,000 unemployed individuals, including graduates and young people.  Through the collaboration between both Departments, this Labour Market Activation Programme has been specifically designed to enable participants on the Programme to maintain their social welfare entitlements.  Following a review of the Programme, Minister Hanafin and I, announced recently a revised Work Placement Programme, with extended eligibility criteria.  I am optimistic that the revised eligibility criteria will make the Programme more accessible for potential participants and for potential providers.The Short Time Training Programme is providing training to 277 people on systematic short time for the days they are not working.  The training will last for a year and again like the Work Placement Programme, individuals will retain their social welfare entitlements whilst on the programme.Another initiative, which allows participants to retain their social welfare allowances, is the specifically designed Institute of Technology 11 week programme for redundant apprentices in the construction, electrical and engineering areas.The integrated approach adopted by the Government and which my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working under will continue to provide support to those who are unemployed and assist them back into employment as soon as possible.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	701	I have no plans to amend the existing eligibility requirements to qualify for agency assistance or the numbers employed by companies to benefit from the services of the particular agencies.The Enterprise Agencies (IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Forfás, Science Foundation Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta) have been involved in a process over the past 12 months to identify ways to further enhance collaboration to achieve more cohesive policy formulation and more effective client service delivery.  In November 2008, I established a High Level Steering Group to develop proposals and implement actions to enhance inter-agency collaboration.  The Group focused on client service as opposed to specific structural and operational aspects, such as shared services.  The Group has submitted a report on the process to my Department, containing prioritised actions.  On-going implementation has been a core objective of the process and the High Level Group is progressing a number of actions.The cross-agency process has identified opportunities for enhanced collaboration within two broad areas:1. Client company interaction with the enterprise agencies (accessing supports and transferring between the agencies);2. Making optimum use of internal resources — knowledge, capabilities and synergies — across the enterprise agencies.The core issue in relation to client company interaction with the enterprise agencies is the need to ensure that the client perspective and business needs are not compromised by agency structures and operating procedures, while at the same time understanding that the agencies operate within the legislative context of the Industrial Development Acts and State Aids rules.As a result of the cross-agency process, the High Level Group has overseen the development of revised procedures in relation to the transfer of client companies between the agencies.  The changes are already resulting in significant improvement to the efficiency of the process, enhanced clarity from the client perspective in relation to the process and a more proactive approach to ascertaining client service needs in the context and aftermath of a transfer — for example, the appropriate continuation of certain services provided by the transferring agency.The High Level Group is also advancing proposals in relation to facilitating (where legislation and State Aid rules currently allow) access to certain Enterprise Ireland services by clients of the other agencies.  It is envisaged that the EI/CEB Co-ordination Unit will be used as a framework to co-ordinate and manage the access of EI services to non-EI clients.The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) are developing a closer working relationship with Enterprise Ireland, particularly through the extension of the EI First Flight programme to eligible CEB clients ready to begin exporting or already exporting overseas and the Enterprise START initiative, facilitated through the co-ordination unit based in EI's regional headquarters in Shannon.In relation to making optimum use of internal resources and knowledge, a number of initiatives are being pursued by the High Level Group.  These include a more structured cross agency ‘on-the-ground' approach to the development of sectors being piloted that aims to:increase awareness of the full complement of companies and capabilities and capacities in support of international marketing programmes;stimulate effective networking and inter-linkages between foreign and indigenous firms andfacilitate the inclusion of indigenous firms on itineraries for foreign firms (potential IDA clients) where relevant and to the overall benefit of Ireland.A Cross Agency information sharing team has been established to drive a systematic approach to collating, updating, sharing and disseminating information that is relevant to all agencies.  A ‘ do once, disseminate widely’ approach is being taken across ALL agencies for:Economic context and background relevant to a wide range of internal and external reports;Slides incorporating common data, trends and graphs;A register of research/analysis work programmes underway in each of the agencies andSharing of sectorally related information in a systematic way (a lifesciences pilot is under way)A more structured and proactive approach has been recommended in the recently completed Regional Competitiveness Agenda, which envisages the establishment of regional level economic fora, that bring together the relevant stakeholders, expertise and competences to stimulate balanced regional development based on realising the potential of the regions.

The Court subsequently invited submissions on the issue.  Various submissions were received, including from IBEC, ICTU and the Department of Finance.  The Labour Court also held discussions with these parties.Under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, the Labour Court is required to have regard to the prospects for any general agreement that may be reached between employer and employee representatives on the appropriate national minimum hourly rate of pay.As the Deputy is aware, discussions are still under way between the Government and the Social Partners on the possibility of reaching an agreement on an integrated national response to the current crisis.  Accordingly, I understand that the Labour Court has not yet concluded — as it is required to do under the Act — that there is no prospect of a general agreement being reached between the parties.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further while

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	706	The Central Statistic Office released this morning the Live Register figures for November.  According to the Live Register there were 413,500 people claiming unemployment benefits at the end of October 2009.  This is 1,100 (0.3%) higher than October 2009.  The Live Register is 146,300 (55%) higher than this time last year.  Positively, the year-on-year increase for November is continuing to decline from its peak of 197,800 and furthermore the Seasonally Adjusted figure for November is 423,300, which is a monthly increase of 800 from October.A key priority for the Government is to support those most vulnerable to detachment from the labour market through the adoption of active labour market policies.  In order for the Government's labour market policies to be effective, it requires a sustained, co-ordinated, integrated approach to jobsearch, training, education and work placement supports.This is why I have doubled the provision of training and work experience places managed by FÁS to over 130,000 and I have increased the referral capacity of FÁS Employment Services from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to 147,00 persons in 2009.  I have also introduced a number of labour market activation policies that will provide support to those who need it most.The Work Placement Programme is aimed at providing 2000 six-month work experience placements for young people, graduates and other unemployed persons, who have finished college or have limited experience of the workplace.  There are 1,000 places ring fenced for unemployed graduates who before this year have attained a full award at level 7 or above on the National Framework of Qualifications and who have been unemployed for the last three months.  To date, 122 participants have been placed and have started on the programme, 87 graduates and 35 non-graduates.  Participants on the programme retain their existing social welfare entitlements for the duration of their placement.FÁS are also managing the short-time working training programme, which provides training to people on systematic short time for the days they are not working.  The training will last for a year and individuals will retain their social welfare entitlements while on the programme.An additional 400 places have been provided in the Community Employment Scheme bringing the total number of places to 22,700 this year.  My Department and the Department of Education and Science are jointly funding the provision of 1,500 part time third level places at undergraduate level for the unemployed.  The Department of Education and Science are also funding 1,000 part time places at postgraduate level. Individuals participating in either programme will retain their social welfare entitlements.The Government has also introduced specific initiatives, which will enable approximately 4,000 redundant apprentices to progress their apprenticeships or receive training.The Government is taking specific measures to ensure that job retention and creation is optimised to its full potential.  Enterprise Ireland have prepared a new recovery strategy to identify the actions that are being undertaken to help clients in 2009.  This strategy refocuses Enterprise Ireland's efforts in facilitating entrepreneurship and the enterprise environment in national, local and rural communities, developing existing clients in all regions and thereby protecting existing jobs.  Enterprise Ireland are also committed in driving the creation of innovation-based start-ups.The Employment Subsidy Scheme has been introduced to support the maintenance of vulnerable jobs and prevent people from being made redundant in this challenging national and global economic environment.  Given the low level of interest in the original Employment Subsidy, I have decided to have a Second broader Call for applications with extended eligibility criteria open to both exporting and non-exporting firms.  The Second Call will be open to many companies that were not eligible to apply for the First Call.  Enterprise Ireland will again manage the Scheme.The Enterprise Stabilisation Fund was launched earlier this year.  The Fund is an initiative aimed to support viable but vulnerable exporting companies who are experiencing difficulties because of the current economic climate.  Client companies of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Udaras Na Gaeltachta and Shannon Development across all sectors within manufacturing and internationally traded services are eligible to apply.To support the development of high potential start up companies, Enterprise Ireland offers the "Innovative HPSU offer" where Enterprise Ireland provides a financial contribution towards the company’s business plan to develop products, services or processes which are technologically new or substantially improved.  Enterprise Ireland also supports start-ups with high potential to scale up, meaning that in the future as the business grows there are likely to be significant gains in employment.On a daily basis, IDA is working with its client companies making every effort to keep those clients operating in Ireland while minimising the job losses encountered.  Despite the economic downturn, Ireland continues to be an attractive location for FDI.  To date in 2009 there have been 47 IDA announcements with a combined investment of €622.5m and the potential to create 2,560 jobs.In addition, during 2009 the County and City Enterprise Boards have reported a significant increase in the number of informal queries from members of the public in relation to setting up their own businesses over the last few months with many Boards providing additional Start Your Business Courses and increased levels of mentoring for owner managers who are experiencing trading difficulties in order to meet the demand out there.  The overall priority for capital expenditure by the Boards is on the development of sustainable growth-orientated micro-enterprises, which, over time, can develop into strong export entities.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	707	The Industrial Development agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland as well as the South Cork County Enterprise Board are making every effort to develop and promote industry in the Youghal area.IDA Ireland is actively promoting the greater East Cork region, including Youghal, to prospective investors across the full range of IDA targeted sectors.  The agency continues to target high value projects, which means that companies who decide to visit Ireland have more sophisticated business requirements.  Their key need in determining where they will visit, and consequently where they will potentially locate, tends to centre on certain criteria.  These include a high quality business environment, access to a large population base, close proximity to an international airport, a top quality road infrastructure and to other similar types of companies, adjacent to a third level institution, and located on a business and technology park with high quality office accommodation and telecoms infrastructure.Ireland is competing for investors who are looking at locations with a large population base, typically in towns/cities with a population in excess of one million.  Therefore, continued success in attracting Foreign Direct Investment must be viewed in the regional context rather than just on individual towns as regions can better demonstrate the necessary critical mass required by companies.  At present in Cork city and county there are 132 IDA supported companies employing over 21,000 people and the area continues to demonstrate its attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment with over 950 new jobs having been announced in IDA supported client companies in Cork since the beginning of 2009.In order to drive enterprise development, Enterprise Ireland plays a key role in partnering and actively engaging with the Youghal Socio Economic Development Group and a sub-committee of that group, the Youghal Employment Creation sub-group.  On a wider level, Enterprise Ireland is represented on the Cork County Development Board and the South Cork County Enterprise Board.Since 2006, Enterprise Ireland has made payments of €58,779,468 to its client companies in County Cork.  This figure includes support to over 45 High Potential Start-Up companies in County Cork since 2006.  Overall, Enterprise Ireland has a client base of over 700 companies in County Cork, employing circa 18,000 people.  Enterprise Ireland works closely with Community groups in the towns of East Cork, including Youghal, to foster further embryonic enterprise and to encourage young graduates to set up businesses in their own localities.  In June 2006, Youghal was successful in their application for funding under the Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Centre Scheme and received approval of €150,000 towards the development of a new Community Enterprise Centre.  Development of the centre, known as Enterprise Youghal, commenced in 2007 and was completed in 2008.  St. Mary's College was developed to house the 3,500 square ft. facility.  A number of clients are already in situ and Enterprise Youghal continues to market the Centre.Enterprise Ireland also works closely with University College Cork and the Cork Institute of Technology to foster links with industry, thereby encouraging industry to increase use of technology.  Under the EI Innovation Partnership and Commercialisation of Research Programme, Enterprise Ireland has, since 2008, made payments of €17,153,864 to third level colleges in County Cork for research projects with industry.Since the County Enterprise Boards inception in 1993 to end 2008, South Cork County Enterprise Board has issued over €5.8 million in grant assistance to 424 clients.  This intervention has assisted in the creation of 942 jobs in the area.  In the same period 1,970 people participated in training programmes.  During 2009, the Board has continued to support enterprise development through the provision of both direct financial assistance (grants) and through indirect or "soft support" assistance and will continue to ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development at local level.County Enterprise Board assistance in the Youghal area has included support of an enterprise centre, direct grant support to eligible micro-enterprises, the promotion of enterprise related activities and of an enterprise culture in Youghal through networking and business development activities to attract new entrepreneurs from the area.

These reports are to be submitted by the 15th day of the month following the end of the quarter.  The first such reports were due by 15 October 2009.  Departments are also required to include information on the implementation of the measures in their subsequent Annual Reports.As a result of the above measures, Departments are required to give greater priority to making timely payments and to ensure that suppliers themselves are aware of how they can assist the process by meeting the requirements of Departments in relation to the submission of invoices.My Department is currently in the process of examining and collating the first returns received from Government Departments.  An initial examination of returns received for payments made by Government Departments during the period 16 June 2009 to 30 September 2009, shows that the majority of these were made within 15 days.As part of the Government Decision of 19th May, the Government also stated that an assessment would be completed of the impact of extending this requirement to the local authority, health and education sectors and this remains under review.  Organisations within the sectors are committed to meting their current payment periods.  Suppliers experiencing difficulties in securing timely payments should, in the first instance, contact the relevant section within the organisation with which the contract was agreed.The application of the 15 day payment period requirement does not extend to semi-state companies but semi-state companies too are already committed to meeting their current payment periods.My Department has made an arrangement through the auspices of the Credit Supply Clearing Group, whereby representative bodies of the SME sector can bring to the attention of the Clearing Group, individual cases of late payments by semi-state bodies which are adversely impacting on the cash-flow/working capital of SME's.  Under this arrangement, my Department will have such late payment practices examined by the parent Government Department involved and reported back on to my Department.In the light of the above arrangements, I anticipate that compliance with the new procedures, should improve overall cash flow to suppliers, including in particular for small and medium enterprises.

These include developments in international accounting standards and the publication of two EU Directives — Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum transparency requirements ('Transparency Directive') and the 8th Company Law Directive on Statutory Audits (Directive 2006/43/EC). Certain sections are also under consideration in the context of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill.

FÁS frontline staffs have been briefed on the changes to the eligibility criteria and are, in turn, informing the public of the changed criteria.Promotional material, information packs, ‘flyers', aimed at prospective candidates and providers are being finalised.  FÁS have just completed a promotional campaign via regional newspapers and radio to promote the programme and to encourage people to refer to the FÁS website or to call the freephone 1800 number.In addition FÁS have met with IBEC to brief them on the changes to the criteria and have provided IBEC with material to circulate to its members.  A meeting has also taken place with the City and Council Managers' Association at which the Work Placement Programme and the expanded criteria were discussed and the future involvement of the local authorities in the programme was explored.Previously all universities, libraries and chambers of commerce, alumni student bodies were contacted to inform them of the programme.  An updated circular is being sent to these organisations to inform them of the revised eligibility criteria.  A renewed publicity campaign for Work Placement Programme, targeting social networking sites e.g. Facebook, Bebo, Twitter; existing informational sites, e.g. Citizens Information, Inclusion Ireland, Politics.ie; media interviews etc., is being finalised at present.FÁS is also in the process of writing to all employers that have already been approved to provide placements, to update them on the revised criteria.  Those employers that applied and were not eligible under the old criteria are also being contacted to inform them of the new criteria.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	715	The Renewed Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to "implement a Code of Practice for doing business in the Grocery Goods sector to develop a fair trading relationship between retailers and their suppliers" and "to review progress of the Code and if necessary to put in place a mandatory code".The House will be aware that I launched a public consultation process seeking the views of all stakeholders in relation to the introduction of a Code of Practice for Grocery Goods Undertakings earlier this year. Responses were received from a wide range of stakeholders including retailers, producers, suppliers, public bodies, commentators and consumers. These responses are currently being analysed by my Department.The commitment to introduce a Code of Practice in the Grocery Goods Sector follows a series of actions undertaken by my Department and its agencies within the past 18 months, aimed at ensuring that there is the greatest degree of transparency possible as to the reasons for the differentials in retail prices, particularly between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland. These actions included National Consumer Agency Price Surveys; the Forfás Report on the Cost of Running Retail Operations in Ireland; and the Competition Authority Study on the Retail-Related Import and Distribution Sector.

Recruitment competitions have been held to bring the number of Inspectors from the original level of 31 Inspectors up to the level of 90 committed to under Towards 2016.  60 inspectors were assigned to NERA from these competitions. 18 Inspectors have left NERA over the past two years as a result of promotion or internal and external Departmental transfers and re-assignments.All new inspectors completed the NERA Inspection Services Introductory Training Programme and have undertaken further training, including on-the-job training with experienced inspectors.  This involves working with experienced Inspectors in carrying out inspections and other associated enquiries at places of work with a view to determining compliance with different employment rights legislation.  Sixty inspectors have completed the Introductory Training Programme to date.  The knowledge and skills of NERA Inspectors are continuously being developed through the provision of targeted training programmes and on-the-job training. All of these Inspectors are currently available for normal duties.The moratorium on recruitment and promotions in the Public Service introduced by the Minister for Finance on the 27th March 2009 makes it more difficult for NERA to further increase the number of Inspectors for the foreseeable future.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	717	The Government fully recognises the difficulties currently being faced by retailers and other businesses as an inevitable consequence of the current difficult economic climate and the importance of ensuring that we continue to have a viable and successful enterprise sector. It is all the more important in these difficult times that businesses, particularly those with a direct presence in the marketplace, ensure that they present as competitive an offering to the trade and the public as possible.Over the past few months we have seen significant downward pressure on costs and on prices generally.  Both the NCB Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers' Indices have shown a sustained and deep period of declining input costs for businesses in Ireland, driven, in part, by lower wage costs.This is matched by Consumer Price Index returns from the Central Statistics Office, which show that overall prices in Ireland fell by 6.6% in the year to October 2009.  This compares with a fall of only 0.8 % in the UK for the same period.  At the European level, the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is accepted as the most appropriate measure for community wide price comparisons, shows that in the year to August 2009 there was a fall of 2.4% in prices in Ireland as compared with an increase in prices of 0.6% throughout the EU as a whole.The above returns clearly show that prices are falling more rapidly in Ireland than in Northern Ireland, the UK and in the EU as a whole. This narrowing in the differential in prices is very much to be welcomed and clearly will help the competitiveness of Irish businesses.Whilst undoubtedly the single market offers opportunities to Irish consumers to shop anywhere within the European Union, the reality is that the majority of cross border shopping by Irish consumers occurs in Northern Ireland, which is not to be unexpected given our common land border and the current weakness of sterling against the Euro.The ESRI recently predicted that, with our current control of costs, productivity should grow by over 3 per cent in 2010. Combined with projected wage decreases of 2.5 per cent, this represents a significant improvement in the competitiveness of the Irish economy.All tax matters, including VAT, are a budgetary matter for the Minister for Finance.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	719	The new eligibility criteria applying to the Second Call of the Employment Subsidy Scheme will be announced shortly. Officials from my Department and from Enterprise Ireland are currently in the process of finalising all of the details of the revised eligibility criteria.I recently issued a Press Release in relation to the Second Call of the Scheme, specifically to inform the public that a Second Call was imminent and would be based on broader eligibility criteria. The Second Call will be open  to both exporting and non-exporting firms. Enterprise Ireland who are managing the Scheme will be placing advertisements in national newspapers calling for applicants for the Scheme and they will update their dedicated website with details of the new scheme.  I can confirm that the Second Call to the Scheme will also be open to companies who do not fall within the remit of my Department’s enterprise development agencies.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	720	As with all Group recommendations relevant to my Department, I am examining the recommendation in the context of Estimates for 2010 and evaluating its potential impact on the provision of services to enterprise and on my efforts to promote employment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	721	The First Call of the Scheme will provide subsidies directly for 7,773 jobs. In addition as part of the application process to the Scheme a further 36,260 jobs have been committed. This means that a total of over 43,000 jobs will be retained as a result of the First Call of the Employment Subsidy Scheme.It is now clear that the initial criteria of the Employment Subsidy Scheme were a key factor for the low take-up under the Scheme's First Call. That is why I have decided to have a second broader call, which will be open to both exporting and non-exporting enterprises from all sectors of the economy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	722	On the 5th of November 2009 Tytex announced its decision to workers to close its operation in Youghal, County Cork, which will result in the loss of over 75 jobs.   FÁS are in contact with the company, and will offer a range of supports to assist those losing their jobs to secure alternative employment.The industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, continue to work to secure new investments for the Cork area.  IDA Ireland actively promotes the advantages of locating in Cork to overseas investors, which include a young skilled workforce, the presence of a University and Institute of Technology, and the availability of first class business parks, good infrastructure and an international airport.There has been very significant investment in both the pharmaceutical/ medical technology sectors and in the information and communications technology sector in the Cork region over the last number of years.  Most recently the foreign direct investment base has expanded with the addition of software, customer support and shared services activities, collectively known as Globally Traded Business.There are currently 132 IDA supported enterprises in Cork City and County.  Recent announcements of new investments in Cork include Big Fish Games, Hovione, Solarwinds, Apex Fund Services, and Marriott International. These projects will significantly add to the value and depth of the overseas industry in Cork.  In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients in Cork to encourage the expansion of their operations. The success of this is demonstrated by the recent expansions of several companies in the county including McAfee, Blizzard, Gilead, Boston Scientific, Trend Micro, Alps Electric, Option Wireless, Alcon, Pfizer, EMC, Siemens, dePuy  Arris and Alcon.Despite the difficult global conditions which are impacting on international companies, Cork continues to demonstrate its attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment with over 850 new jobs having been announced in IDA supported client companies in Cork since the beginning of 2009.

One of these Directives is currently overdue, namely Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual and consolidated accounts.  My Department aims to transpose this Directive by 31 December 2009.Full details on the state of play of all current EU Directives due for transposition are maintained on the Department's website, www.entemp.ie.My Department has received 26 Reasoned Opinions from the European Commission relating to Directives since 2002.

The Minister for Trade and Commerce approved the CLRG's latest work programme in August 2008.  Work is proceeding on all of the items in the programme and the CLRG will report on progress by end March 2010.The CLRG published its General Scheme of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill in July 2007. The Government subsequently approved the drafting of a Bill along the lines of the General Scheme. The proposed Bill will consolidate the existing 14 Companies Acts, dating from 1963 to 2009, as well as other regulations and common law provisions relating to the incorporation and operation of companies, into a single Act comprising more than 1,300 sections.  Given its size and complexity it is envisaged that the Bill will not be published until September 2010 at the earliest.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	725	Within my Department, the enterprise development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards have continued to assist enterprises through their grant and advisory schemes.Enterprise Ireland (EI) is the lead government agency responsible for the development of indigenous enterprise. The deputy is incorrect in his assertion that EI will only deal with companies between 10 and 500 employees if they constitute a high potential start up. The opposite is in fact the case with the majority of EI supported companies, regardless of their designation, employing 10 people or more. Enterprise Ireland is focused on providing support to clients to maximise export sales and consequently employment. This is achieved by investing in companies to help them plan strategy, build capability, access markets and research, finance start-ups and innovation. Continued support of our indigenous exporting companies is an indirect investment in creating and sustaining employment.Earlier this year, I launched the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund, which enables internationally trading companies survive the current global downturn by supporting their drive to reduce costs and, through increased competitiveness, gain sales in overseas markets.In addition, this month, I announced that 7,478 jobs are to receive direct support under the first round of the Employment Subsidy Scheme (ESS).  A total of 453 companies engaged in manufacturing and/or internationally traded services are being informed of their successful applications. The Scheme provides a subsidy of €9,100 over fifteen months per qualifying employee in vulnerable but viable firms.The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. The CEBs deliver a series of programmes to underpin this role.I recently announced my intention to re-convene the Small Business Forum to gain its assessment and views on the impact of the current economic situation on the needs of the SME sector as it positions itself for recovery. This meeting of the Small Business Forum will take place in the coming weeks.Ireland's economic success is intrinsically linked to Irish industry achieving sales in international markets. I therefore, have no plans to expand the remit of the enterprise development agencies to incorporate indigenous companies that are not export-orientated. However, due to a lower than anticipated take-up, I will shortly be announcing details of a second broader call for ESS applications with extended eligibility criteria open to both exporting and non-exporting firms.I am satisfied that the range of measures and supports available through the enterprise development agencies will continue to help Irish industry to adapt and grow in the current economic climate.

FÁS as an agency of my Department operates Job Initiative (JI).The Job Initiative Programme (JI) was launched in July 1996 and provides full time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, unemployed for 5 years or more, and in receipt of Social Welfare payments over that period.The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities. The programme is sponsored by voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities.Following changes introduced on 10 November 2004 by Minister Micheál Martin no new entrants have been admitted onto the Job Initiative Schemes.  However, contracts for existing participants are renewed and CE participants to support the service being provided may replace those who leave voluntarily.This Government will continue to support the positive role of FÁS Employment Schemes in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.   The operation of the Scheme is being kept under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.

Following the outcome of consultations with the Social Partners and other interest groups, a number of changes were implemented for non-EEA nationals applying to enter the Irish labour market under the Work Permit and Green Card schemes from 1 June 2009, including provision for those employment permit holders who are made redundant.My Department will continue to keep employment permit arrangements under review to ensure they remain suitable and relevant to current labour market conditions. As before, the views of relevant stakeholders and interest groups will be taken into account in this ongoing review process.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	728	The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has carried out a total of 23,578 calls, visits and inspections up to the 27th of November 2009.  This compares with 26,781 for the corresponding period in 2008.  The number of actual inspections decreased by 1,135 while the number of calls and interviews decreased by 1,055 and 1,013 respectively.The decreased level of inspection activity in 2009 is mainly reflective of the decrease in the number of Inspectors available to NERA.  In the course of 2009, the number of inspectors has fallen from 80 to the current level of 71.Since it commenced operations on an interim basis in 2007, NERA has had considerable success in raising awareness of employment rights.  Early in 2008, NERA undertook a nationwide information and awareness campaign, which has been instrumental in bringing about a much greater level of awareness both by employers and by employees of their respective rights and obligations under employment law.In 2009, NERA Inspectors were, in addition, authorised to carry out inspections in relation to compliance with the Employment Permit Acts 2003 and 2006.  To date, 879 inspections have been carried out under this legislation.

Out of the 66 applications, 3 have started positions with companies under the programme. Currently there are 7 positions available to be filled under the Work Placement Programme in South Tipperary.Following a review of the Programme, I announced in November along with Minister Hanafin the revised criteria, that are intended to improve the accessibility of the Programme by amending its eligibility criteria for both potential participants and firms providing placements. The revised criteria came into effect yesterday 1st December and I expect that there will be greater opportunities for employers and individuals to avail of placements under the scheme.

Of these starts, 41 are placed in the Public Sector and 88 are placed in the Private Sector. There have been 1,516 graduates and 1,227 non-graduates who have expressed an interest in the programme to date. There are 628 posts available, 393 for graduates and 235 for non-graduates. The following table shows the location of the posts available.I have recently announced revised criteria for the Work Placement Programme, which came into effect yesterday 1st December. The revised criteria will enable easier access to the programme for the unemployed and companies.The key changes relate to the eligibility criteria for the unemployed are:Recipients of most social welfare payments, including Job Seekers' Allowance and Job Seekers' Benefit, will now be eligible to apply. Unemployed persons who are not receiving a social welfare payment will also now be eligible to apply.2009 graduates are now also eligible to apply.The period, for which participants have to be in receipt of a social welfare payment in order to be eligible, has been reduced from 6 months to 3 months.The key changes relating to the eligibility criteria of firms providing placements are:The Programme will be open to all sectors of the economy including, the private, public, and now the community and voluntary sectors.The requirement for a firm to have at least 10 employees has been removed.Previously firms could only participate if they did not have redundancies in the previous 6 months. This constraint has been reduced to 3 months and where the level of redundancies in the last three months was less than 5% of the workforce, these firms will be eligible to participate.The duration of the work placement has been increased to a maximum of 9 months.Graduate PostsNon -Graduate PostsDublin Central5547Dublin North3324Dublin South3623Midlands — Kildare, Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath3010Mid West — Clare, Limerick, Tipperary North469North East — Cavan, Louth, Meath, Monaghan3130North West — Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo719South East — Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary South, Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow5424South West — Cork, Kerry5324West — Galway, Mayo, Roscommon4825Total393235

Up to and including 2007, the average annual intake of redundancy claims was 25,000.  In the latter part of 2008, an increased influx of claims was in evidence with in excess of 40,000 claims received in that year.  Up to the end of October 2009, the intake of claims stood at 67,207 and by the end of the year, it is expected that the annual intake for 2009 could be of the order of 75,000 which would represent a threefold increase compared with the level of claims received up to and including 2007.It is important to note that these figures are indicative of the number of employees on whose behalf claims were submitted for statutory redundancy lump sum payments. They do not reflect those who lost their jobs with less than two years service in an employment.  Nor do the figures record levels of employment or unemployment which are measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, collated and published by the Central Statistics Office.In response to the Deputy's specific question, the number of redundancies reported to my Department for each of the past six months (May to October 2009) amounts in total to 39,518 ranging from 7,971 in May 2009 to 6,561 in October 2009.  A detailed breakdown of the claims by sector is provided in tabular form in a table attached.  The categories in which the highest claims occur are within those classified as Other Services, Building and Civil Engineering and Other Manufacturing.  The category Other Services comprises a range of sectors and would include retail, hospitality, restaurants and a variety of other service sectors not separately categorised.  This category constitutes the highest number of claims with a total of 13,782 for the six-month reference period.  This is followed by Building & Civil Engineering with a total of 8,707 claims and, by Other Manufacturing with a total of 7,617 claims.Overall, the figures captured in the tabular statement do not indicate a particular trend in the level of claims given that in the reference period, claims peaked in May 2009 and, although they reduced considerably in the June/July/August period, claims increased again in September and October.  Thus, it is not possible to conclude that there is any levelling off in the number of claims received.  On average the number of claims received monthly in 2009 is 6,000.Industrial GroupNo. of EmployeesMonth (s)MayJuneJulyAugSeptOctTotal May to OctAgriculture/Forestry & Fisheries8893824714670526Energy and Water172119172716117Extraction Industry (Chemical Products)593243483867287Metal Manufacturing & Engineering3182521681831661901277Other Manufacturing1,3991,7469611,0601,0401,4117,617Building & Civil Engineering1,7961,3871,7831,3341,3251,0828,707Distributive Trades5373425412772503692316Transport & Communications8683232264165959343362Other Services2,6342,2952,2162,2122,1902,23513,782Banking, Finance & Insurance2552892672942351871,527Total7,9716,7806,3065,8886,0126,56139,518

A redundancy situation arises in general where an employee's job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.  An employee is entitled to two weeks pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a maximum of €600 gross weekly pay.  It is up to the employer concerned in the first instance to determine whether or not in fact a redundancy situation obtains and to notify my Department using an RP 50 form which can be downloaded from the Department's website at www.entemp.ie.Disputes in regard to redundancy entitlements can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for adjudication.

Payment of statutory redundancy is, in the first instance, a matter for the employer.  In general, a redundancy situation exists where an employee's job no longer exists.  It is up to the employer concerned to determine whether or not there is in fact a redundancy situation.    In the event of a dispute, the matter should be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a decision.  It should also be noted that an employee must make application for a redundancy payment or seek a determination from the EAT within twelve months of ceasing his employment.A redundancy lump sum is calculated based on the normal weekly wage/salary of the employee on the date he or she is made redundant.  Where a change in wage/salary has been imposed and not agreed, and an employee is subsequently made redundant, it is the normal weekly wage/salary that is used to calculate the redundancy lump sum and not the revised one imposed by the employer.Any dispute between employee and employer in relation to the calculation of statutory redundancy entitlement may be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for adjudication.

Ireland's high dependence on oil and gas imports makes us price takers, sensitive to the volatility of the markets.In common with other economies dependent on hydrocarbons, it is clear that Ireland's economic recovery could benefit from stable oil prices at a reasonable level.  International fuel prices are a key driver of electricity price increases, which are a particular cost concern for the enterprise sector.The Government's energy policy is centred on three pillars, namely: security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability. As part of our response to our dependence on hydrocarbons, under the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, Ireland has a target of supplying 40% of Irish energy needs from renewable sources by 2020. The concerted effort to attain this goal will see Ireland's reliance on oil decrease in the medium to long term. As a result, Ireland will also be less susceptible by fluctuations in oil price levels.I receive regular analysis of the impact of our energy policy on the economy from Forfás and the National Competitiveness Council. Their most recent report on energy was published in September 2009. Forfás are also working on a series of papers on different fuel types, which will assist in forming a longer-term framework for energy policy into the future.

Of these courses there have been 73 clients (who are currently in training with FÁS) who had previously participated on the same course within the last five years.  The following reasons have been recorded on the clients' records for repeating the training:Left the course early to take up employment, wants to complete course now;Did not complete certification modules;Failed Certification; wanted to repeat;Left course due to personal reasons;Hospitalised during the course unable to complete;Family circumstances;Sick Child;Unable for the pace of the course, moved to lower level and progressed back at a later date.In a small number of cases the reason why the client had to repeat the training course was not specified.  However, given the date range specified in the question, PC operating systems and newer versions of software applications operated on some of the courses would have changed significantly, and this may be a factor in upskilling.

The table attached shows the location of the posts available.I have recently announced revised criteria for the Work Placement Programme, which came into effect yesterday 1st December.  The revised criteria will enable easier access to the programme for the unemployed and companies.The key changes relate to the eligibility criteria for the unemployed are: recipients of most social welfare payments, including Job Seekers' Allowance and Job Seekers' Benefit, will now be eligible to apply — unemployed persons who are not receiving a social welfare payment will also now be eligible to apply; 2009 graduates are now also eligible to apply; the period, for which participants have to be in receipt of a social welfare payment in order to be eligible, has been reduced from 6 months to 3 months.The key changes relating to the eligibility criteria of firms providing placements are: the Programme will be open to all sectors of the economy including, the private, public, and now the community and voluntary sectors. The requirement for a firm to have at least 10 employees has been removed; previously firms could only participate if they did not have redundancies in the previous 6 months — this constraint has been reduced to 3 months and where the level of redundancies in the last three months was less than 5% of the workforce, these firms will be eligible to participate; the duration of the work placement has been increased to a maximum of 9 months.Graduate PostsNon-Graduate PostsDublin Central5547Dublin North3324Dublin South3623Midlands -Kildare, Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath3010Mid West — Clare, Limerick, Tipperary North469North East — Cavan, Louth, Meath, Monaghan3130North West — Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo719South East — Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary South, Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow5424South West — Cork, Kerry5324West — Galway, Mayo, Roscommon4825Total393235

It is my understanding from the OPW that the yearly rental cost for this temporary office is in the region of €369,000 and that the fit-out costs were approximately €2,068,000.With regard to the property costs for a permanent building in Carlow, the OPW acquired a site, at a cost of €1,440,000, in Carlow town centre for the construction of a permanent office there.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Noel Ahern TD, announced on 13 December 2007 that the OPW had invited the Macquarie Partnership as the consortium to become the ‘successful tenderer' in respect of this project.  This forms part of a major PPP project, which also involves the provision of office accommodation in Portlaoise for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and in Mullingar for the Department of Education and Science.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	748	I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 120 together.There are many factors which influence a firm's decision to relocate.  Firms adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology or other competitive considerations.  The result is flows of investment and employment across borders.  Ireland has been successful in managing this process, while winning many prestigious and value added investments.As a small, open, export-led economy, our best response to the realities of globalisation is to ensure that Ireland remains attractive for investment and enterprise growth.  Our enterprise support policies have consistently evolved to meet the needs of both foreign direct investment (FDI) and growth-orientated indigenous firms.  Ireland has consistently been ranked highly as an economy in which it is easy to do business.According to the World Bank, Ireland is perceived as lightly regulated, which in itself, lowers costs for business.  Ireland also has the third lowest rate in the EU of corporation tax, which lightens the tax burden on business and gives them an advantage over competitor countries.  However, current operating conditions for companies are difficult and challenging due to a number of factors including the weakness of sterling, tough competition, and the global recession.  Some issues are outside the control of Government as a whole, but where possible we are addressing Ireland's cost competitiveness as an essential element of our economic recovery.  Recently published indicators are in our favour with inflation, commodity and other prices falling.  Both the NCB Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers' Indices have shown a sustained and deep period of declining input costs for businesses in Ireland, driven, in part, by lower wage and energy costs.  This is matched by a decline in Irish inflation that reached minus 6.6 per cent in the year to October 2009 — the sharpest fall in Ireland since the 1920s.  At the same time, EU inflation as a whole was minus 0.1% for the same period, and is expected to be rise by 0.6% in November.We have ensured that Ireland can offer the skills, education, research and innovation capabilities that modern mobile and indigenous firms need to be competitive in world markets.  In recent years, Ireland has undergone a transformation from a low wage/low cost economy towards a high value and knowledge-based one.  Arising from this transformation, the nature of FDI has changed and Ireland is now successfully competing for premium mobile investments against the most advanced countries in the world.Low wage costs are no longer an enticement but have been replaced by other attractions such as a benign tax and regulatory environment, a highly educated workforce, an improving infrastructure and a commitment to world-class standards of research, development and innovation.  These, combined with our can-do, responsive and open attitude, ensure that we remain a location of choice.  By utilizing these competitive strengths, our policies have been successful as many foreign companies continue to make significant investment in Ireland and in the skills of our labour force.The most objective indicator of a competitive economy is the rate of investment by the FDI sector in our country.  We have a firm focus on ensuring that we win for Ireland the leading companies that are at the forefront of global products and services.  Last year despite the global turmoil, 2008 saw Ireland win a total of 130 foreign direct investment projects (60% of which will be located outside of Dublin), worth circa €2 billion and also saw the creation of over 8,800 new jobs.  To date in 2009 there already have been over 40 IDA announcements with the potential to create in excess of 2,500 of new jobs.  The IBM Global Location Trends Annual Report 2009 in October 2009, ranks Ireland as the top performer per 100,000 population for attracting FDI and rising from 19th to 11th place overall in attracting jobs in R&D.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	751	The Consumer Price Index as published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for October 2009 highlights that for the tenth month in a row consumer prices were lower than the prices for the corresponding months in 2008.  Consumer prices were on average 6.6% lower in October 2009 as compared with prices in October 2008.  In so far as the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages is concerned, CSO's returns show that whereas prices increased by 4.6% for the year to October 2008, they fell by 6.4% in the 12 months to October 2009.In so far as the UK is concerned, the Retail Prices Index (RPI) for October 2009 as published by the UK Office for National Statistics shows that whilst overall prices decreased by 0.8%, annual food inflation in the UK increased by 0.07% in the year to October 2009.At the European level, the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is accepted as the most appropriate measure for community wide price comparisons, shows that in the year to October 2009 there was a fall of 2.8% in prices in Ireland as compared with an increase in prices of 0.5% (provisional) throughout the EU as a whole.The above returns show that prices are falling more rapidly in Ireland than in Northern Ireland, the UK and in the EU as a whole.  Whilst this overall narrowing in the differential in prices is very much to be welcomed and clearly will benefit consumers, there remains some areas where the differential in prices continue to be high.The Government continues to engage with the various elements of the retail chain to bring greater transparency as to the reasons for the differentials in retail prices between this jurisdiction and elsewhere, including Northern Ireland and the UK.  My Department and its agencies have undertaken a series of actions within the last 12 to 18 months aimed at ensuring that there is the greatest degree of transparency possible as to the reasons for the north south price differentials.  These actions included National Consumer Agency Price Comparison Surveys; the Forfás Report on the Cost of Running Retail Operations in Ireland; and the Competition Authority Study on the Retail-Related Import and Distribution Sector.  The Government is determined to continue to pursue this issue so as to ensure that Irish consumers receive and can expect to receive a fair deal in the goods and services that they buy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	752	Unemployment is increasing across the country due to the downturn in the economy and this has impacted on all regions.  This situation is unwelcome and the Government is determined to provide those who are unemployed with the necessary support services and training to enable them get back into employment as soon as possible.This is why I have doubled the provision of training and work experience places managed by FÁS to over 130,000 and I have increased the referral capacity of FÁS Employment Services from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to 147,00 persons in 2009.  I have also introduced a number of labour market activation policies that will provide support to those who need it most.In terms of the allocation of training places each of the 8 FÁS Regions develop appropriate plans regarding the range, mix and type of training courses appropriate to the needs of that region.  In this process each region will identify their training needs based on regional profiles, which include: response to the live-register activity of the region; the demand for specific training courses from jobseekers living in the region; response to regional redundancy situations; the skills required by local enterprises to sustain businesses; and current or future (short — longer term) labour market needs of the region.Regional variations in the type and level of training provided to meet the above will exist across regions. Budgets for training courses are allocated across regions based on these factors.  The Government is taking specific measures to ensure that job retention and creation is optimised to its full potential. Enterprise Ireland has prepared a new recovery strategy to identify the actions that are being undertaken to help clients in 2009.  This strategy refocuses Enterprise Ireland's efforts in facilitating entrepreneurship and the enterprise environment in national, local and rural communities, developing existing clients in all regions and thereby protecting existing jobs.  Enterprise Ireland are also committed in driving the creation of innovation-based start-ups.The Employment Subsidy Scheme has been introduced to support the maintenance of vulnerable jobs and prevent people from being made redundant in this challenging national and global economic environment.  I have decided to have a Second broader Call for applications with extended eligibility criteria open to both exporting and non-exporting firms.  The Second Call will be open to many companies that were not eligible to apply for the First Call.  Enterprise Ireland will again manage the Scheme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	753	The last six years have seen many positive trends on Irish Exports.  In the period 2003-2008, annual growth in total Irish exports has averaged 5.5%.  Over the five years in question our Services exports have risen steadily from €37.1bn or 31.1% of total exports in 2003 to €69.2bn or 44.5% in 2008.  Despite the global downturn this year, exports for the first six months of 2009 are actually marginally up on the same period in 2008. Our performance is even more impressive when compared to that of other Member States.  The latest data from the European Commission's statistical agency, EUROSTAT, shows that for the period January 2009 — August 2009, Ireland has the second largest trade surplus of the EU Member States, second only to Germany.  This analysis also shows that some of the major economies in the EU, such as the UK, France and Spain recorded trade deficits and that in many Member States, exports fell by over 20%.There are many positive trends in our export performance in terms of destination markets.  Implementation of the Government's Asia Strategy has, over recent years, resulted in a significant increase in our exports to the key Asian economies, with the value of our exports having risen to over €11bn annually.  Our wider programme of diversifying our markets has also resulted in significant progress in the new EU Member States, the Gulf States, Russia and Brazil. Both my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Commerce and I, have led and will continue to lead Trade Missions to significant markets to build on the momentum already achieved.Trends for Irish owned companies continue to show significant promise.  With the assistance of Enterprise Ireland, many indigenous companies, across varied sectors, are now successfully competing in world markets and providing a range of innovative goods and services.I am confident that these trends will continue, despite the challenging world economic climate at present.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	756	Restoring our national competitiveness is a key priority of the Smart Economy Document published by the Government in December 2008. The Document in setting out a framework to address the current economic challenges also identified a series of priority action points. Progress has been and continues to be achieved in implementing theses action points. Specifically, in the area of access to credit, the Government has provided a number of supports for SMEs, including:A commitment that recapitalised banks should increase their lending capacity to SMEs by 10 per cent over 2008.A Code of Conduct on Business Lending to SMEs, published by the Financial Regulator and in force since March 2009.Funding for SMEs of €300 million provided by the European Investment Bank for lending through three Irish banks.Empowerment of the Minister for Finance under the National Assets Management Agency legislation to issue guidelines on credit supply to participating institutions on an ongoing basis.Establishment of the Credit Supply Clearing Group to identify appropriate solutions where flows of credit to viable businesses appear to be blocked.In the area of local authority charges, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I met with representatives of the City and County Managers Association on a number of occasions to reiterate the importance of providing a supportive environment for business and ensuring that all local charges and levies are applied in a transparent, fair and proportionate manner.  Minister Gormley also wrote to the local authorities earlier this year outlining a number of measures that local authorities should consider in order to further support economic activity.  Local Authorities are aware of these needs and have already reorganised to provide one-stop shops, or equivalent services, for local businesses.Insofar as energy prices are concerned, following significant energy price reductions in May 2009, there has been a further significant reduction in gas prices and a modest reduction in electricity prices for medium business customers from this October.   Data from the CSO highlight this continuing downward trend.  The costs category that includes electricity, gas and other fuels has declined by almost 14% in the past twelve months.In the area of wage costs in the retail sector, employer and trade union interests through the established mechanism of the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) have agreed to a 12-month deferral of minimum pay rate increases in the retail sector that had been due to come into effect from 25 October 2009.In addition, an "inability to pay" mechanism will be introduced into the Joint Labour Committee/Employment Regulation Order system so as to assist in protecting employment in situations where employers are faced with severe economic challenges.Insofar as the Employment Subsidy Scheme is concerned, I recently announced a second broader call for applications with extended eligibility criteria, open to both exporting and non-exporting firms, including companies in the retail sector. Further details of the specifics of the Second Call will be announced shortly.Recent Consumer Price Index Returns from the Central Statistics Office show that prices in Ireland are falling faster than anywhere else in the EU, including Northern Ireland and the UK. This narrowing in the differentials in prices will also benefit the competitiveness of businesses, particularly businesses located in border regions.Government fully accepts the need to concentrate efforts to restore national competitiveness and is committed to pursuing those issues identified in the Smart Economy Document which are particularly affecting competitiveness such as high prices, cost of services, wages etc.

As is normal in the run-up to any budget I have interactions with the Minister for Finance and other Ministers on all areas of interest including VAT rates.However, policy responsibility for taxation matters, including VAT rests with my colleague Mr. Brian Lenihan, T.D., Minister for Finance. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on these matters.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	758	I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 to 129, inclusive, together.Funds are allocated to bodies, groups or agencies under the remit of my Department each year under the annual Estimates process.  I present my Department's Estimate to the Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and set out the allocations for each Agency operating under the aegis of my Department.The Annual Output Statement for my Department, which is also presented to the Committee, outlines the key areas in which the funding will be spent.  The Annual Output Statement includes specific targets to be achieved each year and reports on the progress in meeting the targets set for the previous year.As I indicated in reply to PQ 41080/09 to Deputy Durkan on 18th November last, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am directly accountable to the Oireachtas for the activities of my Department and my Department's own expenditure decisions.  In that regard, together with the Ministers of State assigned to the Department, I answer Parliamentary Questions, Adjournment Debates, etc, on our Departmental policies and strategies.  I also present, as I have already mentioned, my Department's Annual Output Statement to the Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment each year.Consistent with the duties and responsibilities assigned under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts and the Public Service Management Act, the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer and appears before the Public Accounts Committee to answer questions on the detail of the Department's expenditures.  Furthermore, those expenditures are examined each year by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who publishes his findings, and whose report informs the annual PAC consideration of the Department's Appropriation Account.In addition, a number of Agencies operate under the remit of my Department in supporting the development and delivery of our enterprise and labour market programmes in particular.  The roles and responsibilities of these Agencies are set out in their establishment legislation, as amended from time to time.  The chief officer of each Agency, and the chairman of each Agency Board, is directly accountable to the Oireachtas through our Committee system where they can be called to account for individual elements of Agency expenditures.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to answer for the day-to-day decisions and expenditures of the individual Agencies when Oireachtas members have such a direct facility to call to account the Heads of each Agency in relation to their stewardship of the Agency and the day-to-day expenditure decisions they take.In addition to the Agencies and Offices under our remit and in direct receipt of funding from my Department, the Department and our Agencies would also provide funding to independent bodies such as the Crafts Council of Ireland and Skillnets to name just two.  In all such cases, the awarding body, i.e. the Department or the Agency providing the funding, would be accountable for how it has overseen the funding so awarded and would be, in that regard, accountable to the Oireachtas in the manner I have set out above.These systems of accountability to the Oireachtas, which are well-established over a long period of time, operate, I believe, in an manner that strikes the appropriate balance between the principle of democratic accountability by me as Minister and the demands on the Agencies to perform efficiently and effectively the functions for which they were established in their own right.  They ensure that the Oireachtas can access all pertinent information on "day to day expenditure" directly from those who are immediately responsible for taking such decisions, while also holding Ministers directly accountable for overall policy decision or directions, thereby ensuring that the Oireachtas can superintend all Exchequer moneys invested by or under my Department.

In that regard, as is normal practice, my officials in conjunction with the Office of Revenue Commissioners and other relevant Departments will, if the need arises engage with those sectors involved in the implementation of the carbon tax to minimise, in so far as it is reasonably possible, practical difficulties.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	760	I am committed to the introduction of a carbon tax on a phased basis in the context of the 2010 Budget.  In relation to the issue of fuel poverty, it is acknowledged that appropriate measures may need to be put in place depending on the level of carbon tax introduced.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	761	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 170 together.The questions cover the same general issue.  I am aware there has been an increase in insurance premiums this year including motor insurance premiums. This increase however has to be considered against a backdrop of the continuing stress in the financial markets and the recessionary pressures in the economy which is affecting all financial service providers including the insurance industry.While the Financial Regulator does not maintain statistics on price increases in the insurance sector, or the extent to which the valuation of the items or property insured has increased or decreased in 2009, it has provided some background as to why insurance prices have increased in these deflationary times. It has advised me that while the non-life insurance market performed well up to the end of 2006, market sources indicate that much non-life business was written at a loss in 2007. This trend continued in 2008, but the companies were still willing to write business at a loss in order to maintain their market share. They were able to do this as a result of the reserves they had built up during profitable years. However, the situation could not go on indefinitely and indications are that firms are now taking action on pricing to underpin their financial positions.This position is supported by a report published earlier this year by Standard & Poor's titled ‘ A Testing 2009 for the Irish Non-Life Insurance Market, Despite Fundamental Strengths’. It provides an insight into the problems facing the industry at the moment. The report envisages a difficult year for the non-life industry as a result of rising claims and continuing intense competition which they say is limiting price increases. They add that this combined with anticipated lower investment returns is expected to hinder profitability.In the current difficult trading climate, there is a delicate balance to be struck between ensuring the long-term sustainability of the non-life insurance industry and at the same time making sure that the consumer obtains good value for money.  I am particularly conscious of the impact of a significant increase in premiums for both the consumer and business and I have informed  industry that it must be a priority for  them to ensure that insurance cover is provided as competitively as possible consistent with long term commercial sustainability and viability.Finally, the issue of further changes in pricing will be determined largely by the level of claims that the insurance industry receives as this ultimately is the main driver behind price increases.

However, as I said in my earlier reply, and as the Government has made clear on a number of occasions, all public expenditure, pay and non-pay, current and capital, is under review in the context of the Budget.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	763	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested is not available on the time basis requested and either the information could not be obtained or could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of the Revenue Commissioners' records.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 to 138, inclusive, together.With regard to the recapitalisations of AIB and Bank of Ireland, the Government, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, injected €3.5bn of Core Tier 1 Capital into each institution.  In return, the Government received €3.5bn worth of non-cumulative preference shares.  This recapitalisation programme was funded from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  €4 billion came from  the Fund's current resources while €3 billion was provided by means of a frontloading of the Exchequer contributions for 2009 and 2010.   Each institution was charged an arrangement fee of €30m for the recapitalisation, which has been paid by each bank.The €4bn capital injection to Anglo Irish Bank was made from Exchequer funds. As the Deputy will be aware, capital was provided to Anglo to protect the economy from the wider losses that would have occurred in the event of a failure of the bank, to protect Anglo's substantial deposit base, and to prevent the bank from becoming a systemic threat to the financial system. In this context, there was no arrangement fee charged to Anglo, which would have reduced the bank's capital base. However, under the terms of the Subscription Agreement with Anglo Irish Bank, I am in a position to recoup all costs incurred by the State in the process of providing capital to Anglo, and these costs will be recouped from the bank shortly, when the costs have been fully finalised and charged to my Department. The costs incurred in this regard are currently estimated at c.€120,000, in respect of legal and other expenses.In addition, under the terms of the Anglo Irish Bank Act 2009 which took the bank into public ownership, expenses incurred in the administration of the Act are to be recouped from Anglo. Costs incurred in this regard for 2009 are currently estimated at c.€1.9m and the Department is currently in the process of collecting this fee.In the context of the review of the charge under the CIFS Scheme, the NTMA reaffirmed their estimate that the long term cost to the exchequer for the provision of the guarantee remains 15-30 basis points, which roughly equates to €1bn.  As of November 2009, €548m is in the mandated account in the Central Bank and it is the Government's intention that we will at least raise the €1bn by the end of the Guarantee period.I have previously provided the information on the costs on the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 in a number of parliamentary questions.  The GADs which were signed by all the covered institutions provide that all administrative costs associated with the implementation of the CIFS Scheme are recoupable from the covered institutions.  In August 2009, a total of €2,495,449 was recouped and relates to the period, September 2008 to April 2009.  Officials in my Department are in the process of calculating the costs to which are liable to be recouped for the remainder of 2009 and the institutions will be billed in due course.  With regard to costs arising out of bank support schemes in 2010, it is my Department's intention to recoup all administrative costs associated with the CIFS Scheme, ELG Scheme and as in the case of previous recapitalisations, a recapitalised bank will be charged appropriately.

In the absence of clarification it has not been possible to answer the question.  In addition, in order for information to be provided on hydrological surveys that may have been carried out or EU moneys used in respect of such obstructions, it would be necessary for the Deputy to specify the location of the particular obstructions to which he is referring.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	766	I am aware that because of previous claims experience, householders in different parts of the country, including areas in Dublin, have found it difficult to obtain insurance against flood damage.  This is because the decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved. This risk assessment process which insurance companies apply is essential if a company is to be able to provide its services over the longer term and continue to remain solvent. Unfortunately, this means on occasions they have difficulty approving certain types of business because the risk of claims based on previous experience is too high.There have been no specific discussions between my Department and the Consumer Director about codes of practice in this area, as neither I nor the Financial Regulator are in a position under the existing insurance legislation framework to compel  insurance companies to quote for business. In this regard, flood alleviation measures clearly have an important role to play in helping to address instances where households and businesses have experienced difficulties in obtaining insurance against flood damage.Finally, it should be noted that the Government is very conscious of the difficulties caused to certain householders by their inability to obtain insurance against flood damage. This is a problem which will almost certainly have been exacerbated by the recent flooding and consequently will have to be considered as part of its broader review of this general area.

No application was received from Kilkenny County Council in relation to Inistioge or from Carlow County Council in relation to Leighlinbridge.  The OPW will shortly seek applications in relation to works to be undertaken in 2010.  It will be open to the County Councils to apply for funding under the scheme to address the problems in these villages.

This would result in a reduction in the tax relief on pension contributions available to higher rate taxpayers and an additional incentive to pension savings for standard rate taxpayers. However, the full detail and timing of the introduction of this measure have yet to be decided.I have received a pre-Budget submission from the organisation referred to by the Deputy which deals in part with the issue of pensions tax relief.  I will bear in mind its views on this issue and those of other interested parties in the context of  delivering on the Government's commitment in this area.

However, since my reply to the Deputy's question on this matter on 3 February 2009, the Government has decided to defer the reporting of the Advisory Forum.  The decision was taken in light of the more pressing priority of preparing and implementing significant changes to institutional structures for financial regulation and to commit resources for this purpose, and of the high likelihood of changes in the regulation of financial services that could not be anticipated by the Forum.  There have been no meetings of the Forum to-date in 2009.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	773	I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 161 together.The Combined Code on Corporate Governance is a non-statutory code published by the UK Financial Reporting Council, for Stock Exchange registered companies. It sets out standards of good practice in relation to issues such as board composition and development, remuneration, accountability and audit and relations with shareholders.All companies, including banks, which are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange in Ireland, are required under the Stock Exchange Listing Rules to report on how they have applied the principles of the Combined Code or, where they have not applied the principles, to justify any instances of non-compliance in their annual reports.As the current application of the Combined Code in Ireland is to companies listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, consideration of any statutory application of the Combined Code to such companies would have to have regard to existing obligations on such firms under the Companies Acts and is therefore a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the first instance.The commitment in the revised Programme for Government to put the Combined Code on Corporate Governance on a legislative basis for all banks, public companies and State sponsored bodies will complement the revised and updated version of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, which I published in June 2009.The Code of Practice sets out the governance framework agreed by Government for the internal management, and the internal and external reporting relationships, of commercial and non-commercial State bodies. The provisions of the Code do not override existing statutory requirements and other obligations imposed by the Companies Acts. The updated Code reflects a range of changes since 2001 in legislation and administrative guidelines that have implications for the governance framework of State bodies; including revisions to the Ethics and Standards in Public Office legislation, guidelines on the pay of CEOs of commercial State bodies, and tax clearance procedures for public sector contracts.The possible statutory application of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance to State sponsored bodies is under consideration in my Department. In this regard, it will be important to have regard to the current application of my Department's Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies as well as to existing statutory requirements applying to the governance of state sponsored bodies.In relation to the application of the Combined Code to banks and other credit institutions, the Deputy will be aware of the related commitment in the Programme for Government to develop new statutory rules in relation to the governance of major financial institutions in the context of the planned reform of the regulatory structures for financial regulation. I expect to publish legislation to reform the institutional structures for financial regulation in Ireland early next year and its enactment and implementation will follow thereafter.  In developing new statutory rules for the governance of major financial institutions, the Government will take cognisance not only of the Combined Code but also proposals in relation to the reform of governance of credit institutions that are being developed by the European Union and at the G20 level.

The latter category would include applicants who were satisfied that they would not qualify once the terms and conditions of the exemption were explained to them in detail and applicants who were not prepared to undertake the necessary administrative procedures such as adopting a formal legal structure or drawing up a Governing Instrument.I am advised by Revenue that there are many and varied reasons for refusing to grant a charitable tax exemption but the most common relate to situations where the objects of the body or trust are not considered charitable or where the public benefit test is not fulfilled.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	782	I am informed by the CBFSAI that it undertook a survey of institutions, looking at the number and value of accounts covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS), in mid-2008.  The survey was based on data as of June 2008.  At the time the survey was conducted the deposit guarantee scheme provided for compensation of 90 per cent of eligible deposits up to a maximum of €20,000, per depositor.  Institutions were asked to supply data on deposit accounts covered by the DGS for certain ranges.  The survey did not include the ranges referred to in the Deputy's question.The findings of the survey suggested that approximately 10 million deposit accounts fall under the DGS with an aggregate value in the region of €200 billion.  Of these, approximately:97 per cent of accounts, by number, had a balance less than €50,00020 per cent of accounts, by value, had a balance less than €50,00092 per cent of accounts, by number, had a balance less than €22,222 (representing 100% of a deposit where the maximum payout of 90% would be €20,000 as above)12 per cent of accounts, by value, had a balance less than €22,222.As the Deputy will be aware, since the original question, I announced on 20 September 2008 that the Government had decided to increase the compensation limit for the Deposit Guarantee Scheme in Ireland from €20,000 to €100,000 per depositor per institution.  The cover now applies to 100% of each individual's aggregate deposits up to the prescribed limit per financial institution and also applies to deposits held in credit unions (the Registrar of Credit Unions has advised that 2.94 million credit union members held €12.5 billion of savings in Irish credit unions as of June 2009).  The Deputy will also be aware that amendments were made to the DGS Directive through Directive 2009/14/EC in March of this year.  The Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009 provided a statutory basis for the making of subsequent regulations (European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 228 of 2009)) in order to give legal effect to the Government decision on deposit guarantee arrangements and to transpose Directive 2009/14/EC.    The European Commission is undertaking a further review of the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes.  The purpose of this review is to ensure over the longer term the greater effectiveness of the Directive and address any deficiencies or risks that may have arisen as evidenced by the current financial crisis.  The review is ongoing and the Commission is expected to bring forward legislative proposals, if deemed necessary, early in 2010.

However, I would like to make clear that the arrangement to which the Deputy refers has been agreed to purely as an interim measure and it is not foreseen that this situation will persist beyond the short term.Regarding the appointment of internal candidates, I would remind the Deputy that this is a matter for the bank in the first instance. I am aware that a search to fill the position of Chief Executive Officer of the specified bank was carried out using professional recruitment consultancy services, and that this search was extensive and international in nature.The Deputy also raised the question of signals being sent to the international investment community. In response, I would point to the signals being sent by this Government that it is far from business as usual in the Irish banking sector. Reform of the regulatory structure is being advanced and as the Deputy will be aware I have intervened in the matter of the level of salary for the incoming managing director of the particular bank.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	786	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs controls at Weston Airport and at private airports in general are risk-based.  The controls are carried out by mobile Customs enforcement staff, whose attendance is selective and targeted, based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators.  Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence.  Traffic with origins and destinations with a high-risk rating would attract particular interest.It is important to note by way of context that the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than anti-smuggling checks.  This is particularly relevant in the case of small private airports where passenger traffic is predominantly intra-Community.  The approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.I have been assured by the Revenue Commissioners that, while the situation is kept under review, they are satisfied with the current level of Customs controls at these locations.  In particular, they are satisfied that the risk-based approach remains valid and that the controls applied are on a par with, and may even exceed, those of many other EU Member States.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	789	Any building society which has been formed, registered with the Financial Regulator and incorporated in accordance with the requirements of the Building Societies Act, 1989, may undertake any of the activities permitted under the Act. Such activities include, but are not limited to, the making of housing loans. Decisions in relation to which permitted activity or activities an individual building society undertakes is a matter for that building society and its membership, subject to approval, as appropriate, by the Financial Regulator.  Notwithstanding this, I have indicated, during the Committee Stage debate on the NAMA Bill, that it is desirable that the State should continue to have at least one functioning building society whose business, rather than concentrating on commercial lending, operates for the primary benefit of its membership.

A historical breakdown of outstanding residential mortgages is available on the Central Bank's website. However, the series only begins in December 2003.  The value of outstanding mortgages for principal dwellings issued by credit institutions' Irish domiciled offices to Irish residents was €113.5 billion at the end of Q3 2009, an increase of 1.9 per cent over Q3 2008, according to figures from the Central Bank Sectoral Developments in Private Sector Credit September 2009 (as published on www.centralbank.ie (Table 1)).  Data on new business volumes indicate that approximately €31 billion in new mortgages were issued over the year ending Q3 2009.  However, these figures for new business include renegotiations of existing mortgages and would also include investor mortgages.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	792	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that approximately 322,000 of the 564,000 mortgage accounts that were in receipt of mortgage interest relief up until the seven-year rule change introduced from 1 May 2009 have continued to receive mortgage interest relief.  In the case of accounts where the payment of relief was terminated and subsequently reinstated after receipt of the necessary information by the Revenue Commissioners, either from the lender or direct from the mortgage account holder, any arrears of relief were or are being automatically credited to such accounts by the lender, without the need for any further action by the account holder.  I understand that 242,000 accounts are no longer in receipt of mortgage interest relief as a result of the Supplementary Budget measures.The Revenue Commissioners are finalising the processing of some 2,000 of the more complicated cases involving mortgage accounts with consolidated or top up loans as a key feature of the mortgage account. I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the processing of these cases, following the provision of detailed information from the account holders, will be completed as soon as possible and payment of relief will, in appropriate cases, be reactivated and any arrears of relief credited to the accounts.

As the Deputy is probably aware, school age childcare services are not subject to specific regulation and I have already signalled that this is an issue I would like to see addressed at the earliest opportunity.  A commitment to introduce a regulatory framework for school age childcare services was included in the recently agreed revised Programme for Government and I would fully support this course.The Deputy will also be aware of the current difficulties arising from staffing and other constraints and the fact that, in the short to medium term, these will necessitate prioritisation of both new and existing work commitments.  Notwithstanding these constraints, I would hope that my Office will be in a position to commence preparatory work on the development of a new regulatory framework for school age childcare services during 2010 — 2011.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	798	I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 178 together.The supply of prescription only medicinal products by Internet suppliers (online) is prohibited in Ireland by the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, S.I. 540 of 2003, as amended.  While it is impossible to ascertain exactly the extent and value of medicine purchased online here, in 2008 the Irish Medicines Board, working in cooperation with Revenue Commissioners Customs Service, intercepted almost 3000 instances of imports of prescription only medicinal products supplied by Internet websites. These imports were detained. This amounted to a total of 393,067 tablets and capsules. Each intending purchaser was advised of the legal position as outlined above. All these supplies were unlawfully made.  The Irish Medicines Board’s focus is to prevent the supplies reaching the consumer so as to protect public health. In doing so it cooperates with other agencies nationally and worldwide in the combating of pharmaceutical crimes and to identify the suppliers and put them out of business wherever they may be operating.12 instances of confirmed counterfeit product were found in 2008 among the almost 3000 online supplies. Due to the extent of diagnostic and analytical work that would be involved in examining the contents of each package in order to determine if it was genuine or counterfeit, it is not possible to accurately estimate the actual amount of counterfeit product within those supplies. It should be noted that these products were supplied to individuals, apparently for their own use, and were not in bulk for re-supply.The Irish Medicines Board monitors the legal supply chain closely through inspection and authorisation of manufacturers and wholesalers of medicinal products. Wholesalers must comply with European guidelines on Good Distribution Practice which include a requirement to have a procedure to check for counterfeit products and to report any suspicions to the IMB. Particular obligations are placed upon each wholesaler to establish the legitimacy of its suppliers, and its systems for doing so are examined during IMB inspection.  The IMB works closely with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and with the Health Service Executive in relation to the supply of medicinal products in pharmacies and joint activities have been conducted in this regard. The IMB also monitors general sale medicines that are available in non-pharmacy retail outlets.  To date, no counterfeit medicinal products have been found on the legal supply chain in Ireland.

The SLAN study was last conducted in 2007 and does not cover the period in question.The Office of Tobacco Control (OTC) also monitors cigarette smoking prevalence and behaviour on a monthly basis to gain a detailed picture of smoking patterns and to identify trends in this pattern. The data set is compiled from a monthly telephone survey of 1,000 people over the age of 15.  With effect from May 2008 the survey methodology changed to the use of a combination of landlines and mobiles, as opposed to landlines only, to reflect changes in demographics and technology. The OTC is currently recalibrating the survey data collected prior to May 2008 and will shortly complete its analysis and publish the results. Therefore, data for the period April 2009 onwards will not be available until the New Year.

In the period referred to by the Deputy there have been two such programmes: the Transport Operational Programme 1994-1999 and the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme 2000-2006.  The source of EU assistance in both cases is the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).  For the period from the start of 1999 to date, the ERDF assistance approved by the European Commission in respect of the national road elements of the two programmes concerned amounted to €781 million, of which €196 million was provided under the Transport Operational Programme and €585 million was provided under the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme.  In addition, my Department has lead responsibility for the management in Ireland of EU Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) funding.  TEN-T funding allocated for national road projects since the start of 1999 amounts to €43 million.  EU funding for national road development has also been provided for programmes in respect of which other bodies in Ireland have the lead management role under EU Regulations.  These include the Cohesion Fund, the Interreg Programme, the Peace Programme and the Regional Operational Programmes.

The decision to restructure the three airports was considered the best way to equip them to deal with the challenges and opportunities facing the aviation sector at that time.  Under the Act, both the Minister for Finance and I have to be satisfied as to the state of operational and financial readiness of the three airports before any vesting of assets can take place.  In the meantime, the Act provides that both Cork and Shannon Airport Authorities would remain within the operational control and ownership of the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA).  In December 2008, following the recommendations of the boards of the three State Airport Authorities, I announced the deferral until 2011 of a decision on the separation of the Airports under the State Airports Act 2004 given the current very difficult circumstances in the aviation sector. As part of these arrangements both the Cork and Shannon Airport Authorities will have a maximum of nine directors each. DAA will have a board of 13 directors in all.  As to the costs of the DAA board, relevant directors' remuneration is disclosed in the annual report and audited financial statements which are laid before each House of the Oireachtas annually.  In the case of the Shannon Airport Authority and the Cork Airport Authority directors' remuneration in 2008 amounted to €178,000 and €124,000 respectively.

The Government's 2005 aviation action plan approved among other things the construction of a second terminal at Dublin Airport.  That decision reflected widespread concern about the adequacy of facilities in Terminal 1, which originally opened in the early 1970s. Construction work on terminal 2 (T2) commenced in October 2007 and terminal construction will be completed early next year.  The terminal will become operational on a phased basis in 2010.  T2 will provide a necessary gateway for short haul and long haul traffic into and out of Ireland over the coming decades.  The DAA considers that it is neither practicable, nor indeed would it make financial sense, to delay completion of the T2 project.  Remuneration of investment in T2 depends on the overall level of airport charges at Dublin Airport, as determined by the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR). In a direction given by me to CAR on 27 October last, I drew CAR's attention to Government policy on the development of T2.  It is now a matter for CAR to consider how it will address the direction in its final determination, which is due shortly.

A non-EEA national may be granted permission to remain in the State as the partner of an Irish citizen.  Each case is assessed on its merits and what counts is that the partnership is genuine and that the partnership has existed for at least two years.  It is a matter for the applicant to prove the relationship to the satisfaction of the Minister.  This may include evidence of joint bank accounts, utility bills etc.The illegal status of the non-EEA partner clearly complicates matters.  All foreign nationals have a responsibility to ensure that they have permission from the immigration authorities to be in the State and the fact that they have entered into a relationship with an Irish national in no way dilutes this obligation.  Any person who is unlawfully present in the State would be expected to leave.  However, such persons are not prevented from making an application for leave to remain while in Ireland.  This includes a person who is claiming to be the partner of an Irish citizen.  It should be noted that the making of this application does not of itself confer any additional legitimacy on their presence in the State.An applicant should provide full information of their immigration history in the State and their relationship with their Irish partner and also outline any extenuating circumstances in respect of their illegality.  The State must, in addition to ensuring that those who obey the rules benefit from doing so, be careful to ensure that any partnership is not contrived or constructed for the purposes of circumventing immigration controls.

Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned was informed, by letter dated 8 January 2009, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her child. She was given three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), to be exercised within 15 working days. Namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of Deportation Orders or to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her child should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.This communication also advised the person concerned of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations.

As stated in a previous Reply, Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, provides the Minister with a power to amend or revoke a Deportation Order. An application seeking to revoke a Deportation Order must set out any new facts or circumstances which have arisen since the original decision to deport was made. Any such application submitted would be considered on its merits, having due regard to all refoulement issues, and following such consideration a decision would be taken to either affirm or revoke the Order.

The Act declares that such specified areas are areas "being substantially Irish-speaking areas and areas contiguous thereto which, in the opinion of the Government, ought to be included in the Gaeltacht with a view to preserving and extending the use of Irish as a vernacular language".  Areas determined by Government to be included in the Gaeltacht may be in rural or urban locations.By means of the Gaeltacht Areas Order 1956, a total of 84 District Electoral Divisions (DEDs) and parts of a further 58 DEDs were determined to be Gaeltacht areas under section 2 of the above-mentioned Act.  Three further Orders have since been made — in 1967, 1974 and 1982 — determining additional areas for inclusion in the Gaeltacht.The Deputy will be aware that the draft 20-year Strategy for the Irish Language has been submitted for consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The draft Strategy contains a number of proposals with regard to Gaeltacht areas.  For example, it proposes that Gaeltacht status should be based on linguistic criteria only and given statutory status through a new Gaeltacht Act. It also proposes that there should be provision for "Network Gaeltacht Areas", which would be predominately in urban communities that have achieved a basic critical mass of community and State support for the Irish language, and would be afforded special status accordingly. The draft Strategy will be submitted for final approval by Government when the process of consideration by the Oireachtas Committee is completed.

In order to qualify for a rent supplement, from 27 July 2009, a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the relevant local housing authority. Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.The Executive has advised that the person concerned applied for rent supplement in August 2009. As he did not satisfy the qualifying conditions for access to rent supplement, he was advised to apply to his local housing authority for an assessment of his housing needs. An assessment, indicating that he is eligible for and in need of social housing support was completed by the Local Authority on 19 October 2009. In accordance with the relevant legislative provisions, rent supplement has been awarded from the 19 October 2009. The person concerned does not have an entitlement to rent supplement for any period prior to being assessed by a housing authority as being eligible for and in need of social housing support.The Executive has further advised that the person concerned appealed against the decision not to backdate the payment of rent supplement to August 2009, to a HSE Appeals Officer. That officer upheld the decision of the Executive. It remains open to the person concerned to appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

The Government recognises the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of the recent floods. Community Welfare Service staff throughout the country have been providing huge support to families every day since this flooding occurred.  They have already provided emergency financial and other assistance to households affected by the flooding to cover items such as clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs.  Community Welfare Officers have made over 470 initial emergency payments to people in areas impacted by flooding, including 200 payments made in Cork.  The average payment made was €300.  Officers will continue to make these payments as long as there is a requirement to do so.In addition to this, a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme is being set up to provide means-tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes.  An initial sum of €10million has been set aside by the Government for this purpose.  As the flood waters abate and people assess the full extent of the damage to their homes, qualified households can claim for essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods.  Assistance will also be available for structural repairs to homes not covered by household insurance.  Humanitarian assistance is not an alternative to insurance in cases where household insurance was available on a reasonable basis.However, where insurance cover is not available because of previous flooding claims, a person may claim humanitarian assistance.  All of the main insurance companies have 24 hour, 7 day a week dedicated phone help lines in place to assist people to make claims under their household insurance policies.  Depending on nature of the insurance policy held, some companies may make advance payments to help people replace their most important belongings immediately. Insurance companies have undertaken to process claims as quickly as possible.  Costs of medical treatment and supplies may also be considered in determining assistance where medical cover is not already in place i.e. private health insurance or medical card.The level of payment available under the aid scheme to any qualified individual will depend on the severity of the damage to that person's home and the extent of the loss experienced as well as household income and general family circumstances.  The scheme will provide hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation.  As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses will not be covered by the scheme nor will losses which are covered by household insurance.  Applications under the scheme will be means tested to ensure that available assistance will be prioritised for those who are most vulnerable.  Neither will it cover damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation, though humanitarian assistance may be considered in the case of a tenant's personal belongings.The basic principle of the means test will be to determine the household's capacity to meet the costs of restoring their home to a habitable condition.  All household income will be considered when determining entitlement to payment. However, account will be taken of outgoings such as rent or mortgage payments, other loans and travel to work costs.  In addition to the means test, other factors will also be considered by the Community Welfare Service in assessing individual applications, including whether the applicant is or was homeless as a result of the flooding, the age profile of family members i.e. babies, young children or elderly persons, the availability of support from the wider family; and the special needs that people may have as a result of illness or disability.  People seeking assistance should contact their local Community Welfare Office.  Further information and applications forms in relation to the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme are available from the Community Welfare Service in the affected areas and from the Department's website ( www.welfare.ie ) and the HSE’s website (www.hse.ie).  While this scheme is not intended to provide full compensation for all losses and damage it will go towards alleviating the hardship which many hundreds of families have had to endure.

In this regard, the Bereavement Grant is a once off payment designed to assist families in dealing with funeral expenses on the death of an insured person.  It is paid by cheque to the spouse, partner, next of kin or personal representative of the deceased or to the person responsible for the payment of the funeral bill.  The scheme covers virtually all insured persons, including the self-employed and people covered by the modified rate of social insurance, for example, public servants.  A payment in the amount of €850 was paid to the spouse of the deceased on 23/10/2009.  Mr. Brereton also received an Exceptional Needs Payment of €2,000 from the Community Welfare Officer on the 28 of September 2009 in respect of funeral expenses in relation to his late wife who passed away on 22 August 2009.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	850	The Family Support Agency operates the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme (FRC Programme).  Funding for the FRC Programme in 2009 is €18.047 million. There are 107 Family Resource Centres (FRCs) nationwide.  Running costs for FRCs include the cost of employing between one and three workers (such as a coordinator, administrator or community development worker).  Running costs could also include rent (where applicable) and other overheads.  Running costs paid by the Family Support Agency to FRCs range from about €80,000 to about €200,000 annually depending on the nature of the FRC.  Family Resource Centres involve people from marginalised groups and areas of disadvantage at all levels in the project.  Over 900 people serve on voluntary management committees of FRCs with other volunteers contributing each year to FRC activities and programmes.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	852	The Child Benefit scheme has, in recent years, experienced significant expansion in the volume of claims received, the rates of payment and the diversity of the customer base.  The annual cost in 2008 was approximately €2.46 billion and the payment is made to children of some 190 nationalities living in Ireland.  Against this background, the control policy for the child benefit scheme has been reviewed to ensure that controls against fraud and abuse of the scheme continue to be effective and relevant.  As a result of the review, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised.  When implementing control initiatives, the Department is mindful of the need to target those areas that have been identified through Fraud and Error Surveys and on-going control projects as posing the higher risks.  Previous Fraud and Error Surveys, on both the Child Benefit scheme and other areas, indicated that non-Irish nationals pose a significantly higher control risk than the overall customer base.  All of the non-Irish mothers referred to by the Deputy — and also mothers from outside the EU — are required to produce the certificates.The certification review process has initially focused on the highest-risk categories of customer and will be expanded to include other customer groups in the future.  Currently the certification exercise in Child Benefit takes two forms.  Employment certificates are issued, irrespective of nationality, to everyone, including Irish nationals, who are paid under EU regulation 1408/71.  The majority of children in this group live outside Ireland.  Residency certificates are issued to all non-Irish national claimants, living with their children in Ireland.  The Joint Committee on Social & Family Affairs Welfare Fraud report in September 2009 welcomed the introduction of the revised and more frequent residency and employment certification and was encouraged by the savings made so far as a result of these changes.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	853	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Similarly, mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  Significant improvements have been made to the means test for rent and mortgage interest supplement in recent years.  The assessment of means now provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Those availing of part-time employment (less than 30 hours a week), community employment, and/or specified training opportunities can continue to receive rent or mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.A person is regarded as being in full-time employment where s/he is works for 30 hours a week or more and in general, a person is not entitled to rent or mortgage interest supplement while engaged in remunerative full-time employment.  However, where an existing rent supplement tenant has been out of full-time employment for at least 12 months and, has been accepted by a housing authority as being eligible for accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme, that person may engage in full-time employment and still be considered for rent supplement, subject to their satisfying all of the other conditions of the scheme, including a means test.  Arrangements are in place to allow a person to participate in approved employment or training schemes or engage in full-time employment and retain entitlement to mortgage interest supplement on a tapered basis for up to 4 years in certain limited circumstances.  The Department is actively considering the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements for those who participate in the graduate placement scheme and a decision will be made shortly.

The maximum valid contributions a person can have in a tax year are 53.  The person concerned has recently indicated that he had two employers in the relevant tax years.  The Department is in receipt of a P45 from the first employer, and the person concerned has been requested to supply a P45 from the second employer.

The Order sets out the basis on which the Society shall be governed.  It provides that there shall be a Central Council which shall exercise the powers of the Society, organise the Society and control and manage the affairs of the Society.  Membership of the Central Council is by way of appointment by the Government or by election in accordance with the rules of the Society.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Irish Red Cross Society Order, 1939 the Chairman of the Irish Red Cross Society shall be a member of the Central Council and shall be nominated by the President of the Society.  The Red Cross Act, 1944, provides that the President of Ireland shall by virtue of her Office be President of the Society.An individual must be a member of the Central Council of the Society before s/he can be appointed as Chairman.  In nominating persons to Central Council, the Government considers that it is highly desirable that the Society should have on its governing body, professional people with a wide variety of knowledge and expertise, gained through work experience in both the public and private sector and volunteer experience with the Society.  The Government, in recommending to the President a person to act as Chairman, will carefully consider and nominate a person who it deems will make a positive contribution to the affairs of the Society.

My Department has funded a pilot programme to test a range of new, small-scale waste-water collection and treatment systems under Irish conditions.  The objective of this pilot programme was to evaluate new approaches to meeting the waste water collection and treatment needs of rural communities.  The National Rural Water Services Committee, which is currently being established, will consider the Final Report on the performance of new infrastructure provided under this pilot programme.  I will review the future role of group sewerage schemes in the provision of waste water collections systems in the light of the Committee's report.In the case of group water schemes a grant of 100% of the cost of essential treatment and disinfection facilities is available for schemes participating in bundled Design Build Operate contracts.  Other necessary works like buildings, reservoirs, pipelines associated with the contract are grant aided at up to 85% of cost, subject to a maximum grant of €6,475.66 per house.  Grants of up to 85% of cost subject to a maximum grant of €6,475.66 per house are available for new group water schemes and for general upgrading of existing group water schemes using conventional procurement.  The current grants available for group water schemes are considered adequate and I have no proposals at present to review them.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	861	The purpose of the Major Emergency Development Programme was to enable the Principal Response Agencies (the Garda Síochána, Health Service Executive and the main local authorities) to respond to a major emergency which occurs in, or affects, their functional areas in any part of the country. Under the Framework for Major Emergency Management, the Major Emergency Development Programme organised by my Department in the period 2006 to 2008 resulted in the Principal Response Agencies adopting Major Emergency Plans on 30 September, 2008.The new system replaced a Framework in place since 1984.  Preparedness appraisals were undertaken by the major local authorities at the end of 2008, reviewed by my Department, and deemed valid in accordance with the provisions of the new Framework. Copies of the various major emergency plans are available from the local authorities. While no authority declared a Major Emergency for the recent flooding, the procedures set out in the Major Emergency Plans were utilized to ensure an interagency co-ordinated response to the flooding. The various authorities, agencies and voluntary bodies used the preparedness steps of the Major Emergency Plans to underpin their response. I am satisfied, from my own visits to affected areas, and from reports received from these areas, that the Principal Response Agencies, together with the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, voluntary bodies, community groups and individuals responded as effectively as possible in the difficult circumstances involved, in dealing with the flooding in various parts of the country.

While the number of connections may appear to be small, it should be noted that each of these connections is being used to provide services to numerous individuals, e.g. employees in organisations such as Wexford County Council and Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It should also be noted that just one connection by a broadband service provider can allow that service provider to provide onward services to many hundreds of its own customers.The cost of connecting to a MAN is a commercial matter between e|net and its customers.  A connection to a MAN primarily comprises construction costs.The MANs have played an important role in improving Ireland's telecommunications market.  An analysis carried out by e|net showed an estimated 570,000 people rely on the MANs for some form of communications services.  The importance of MAN infrastructure, in terms of helping to secure indigenous and foreign investment is highlighted by IDA data which shows that most of the foreign direct investment in 2007 went to MAN-enabled towns, which was not the case before the MANs became available.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	868	On 15th July, the Government approved my plan for a reorganisation of my Department's Local Office Network. The plan involves reducing, from 57 to 16, the number of offices from which the Department will operate District Veterinary, Forestry and Agricultural Environment and Structures support services in the future.The decision to close some forty offices of the Department was made only after we had completed a detailed study of the Department's operations at local level. Decisions were made in relation to the overall strategy and against a background of major changes in the Department's operating environment in recent years brought about by the impact of the Single Farm Payment, benefits derived from substantial investment in Information Communications Technology and significant reductions in the incidence of disease.As part of this plan the Mallow AES and South Mall AES/DVO offices will be closed. The work from these offices will be transferred to a new office to be located in Fermoy. No contractual arrangements have been entered into regarding accommodation in Fermoy to date. The Office of Public Works is in discussions in relation to this accommodation but no decisions have been taken as yet.As regards client concerns, improvements in business processes, information technology and communications will allow the Department to provide to all of our clients, such services as those referred to earlier, from the 16 enhanced offices set out in the plan. In essence, the new structure was designed to improve and enhance service delivery by integrating into regional offices a range of services that were previously delivered from a much larger number of local offices, thus delivering better levels of customer services through new regional ‘one stop shops'.The various staff associations are being consulted in relation to the redeployment of staff within my Department and to other Departments.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	869	The draft legal instrument to introduce a ban on the sale of raw milk from all species for direct human consumption is at an advanced stage.  Officials from my Department have been in consultation with the Department of Health and Children with a view to implementing the ban by means of a Statutory Instrument under the Health Act of 1947 (as amended).A public consultation process was undertaken last year and resulted in the receipt of submissions from interested parties relating to the proposal to extend the ban to milk from sheep and goats. Following examination of these submissions by my Department's experts, it was decided, with the agreement and support of the FSAI, that the consumption of unpasteurised milk is an unnecessary and unacceptable risk to public health and that a ban on the sale or supply of unpasteurised milk from all species should be implemented.Introducing the proposed ban will involve notifying the EU Commission as required by EU Directive 98/34, which deals with the provision of information regarding technical standards and regulations. This process will commence shortly.

These include having the necessary educational qualifications, having previously held no quota, and having their own lands, herd number and separate milking facilities. The detailed rules governing the scheme are available from my Department (including on its website) and from participating Co-ops. The first stage of the 2010/2011 Scheme will be completed shortly and a second stage will be implemented in the spring.The same criteria, together with the requirement to submit a business plan, applied to successful applicants to the recently completed New Entrants Scheme. This scheme is currently being reviewed with a view to deciding whether to implement a similar scheme in 2010.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	874	In 1990, greenhouse gas emissions from Ireland's agriculture sector amounted to 19.9 million tonnes CO2 equivalent. By 2007, this amount had been reduced, by 6.5%, to 18.6 million tones. This reduction was achieved despite a marginal increase in livestock activity in that period. The most recent EPA projections indicate that emissions from the sector will be reduced further, to an average of 18.2 million tonnes per annum for the Kyoto period 2008-2012, a reduction of 8.5% compared to 1990 emissions levels.  Even in its “best case” scenario, the EPA projections show that, apart from a reduction of 0.3 million tonnes in the residential sector, Ireland’s agriculture sector will be the only sector of the economy to deliver emissions reductions in the Kyoto period. To assist the Government in identifying the most appropriate means of achieving emissions reductions in the non-trading sector of the economy (which includes emissions from primary agriculture) the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security is examining the emissions reduction potential of the entire non-trading sector and will report to Government on the optimum alternatives to achieve our national emissions reduction commitments.While I recognise that achieving further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture sector presents a major challenge, I believe that the sector will continue to play its part in both reducing emissions and adapting to the impacts of, what seems now to be, the unavoidable changes to our climate. Accordingly, my Department will, where possible, continue to take measures designed to the reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that increase renewable energy option. In that context, my Department will continue to examine various abatement options in close liaison with Teagasc.Under my Department's Research Stimulus Fund there has been a significant commitment, of €15.5 million, to climate change research projects since 2005. This includes research into such areas as more efficient slurry application, increased use of clover, which would reduce nitrogen usage, non-inversion tillage and increasing the length of the grazing season.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	875	The National Economic and Social Forum (NESF) published its Report, "Child Literacy and Social Inclusion — Implementation Issues", on 11 November 2009. The  report, which I have welcomed, is the first to be produced under the National  Economic and Social Forum's current mandate from the Government, that is, to  focus strongly on the Irish experience of policy implementation.  The Report is  aimed at complementing the ongoing evaluation of DEIS. The project team for the  NESF report included representatives from my Department.The Educational Research Centre (ERC) is the independent evaluator of the  School Support Programme (SSP) component of DEIS. A comprehensive evaluation of  DEIS involving an in-depth programme of research to inform policy formation has  been commissioned and will be concluded in mid-2010.  As part of the evaluation  of DEIS, an ERC report entitled Educational Disadvantage in Primary Schools in  Rural Areas is to be published in the near future.In addition, the Department's Inspectorate has been undertaking work in relation  to evaluation of examples of good practice. The inspectorate has recently  published a report entitled "Good Practice in Literacy and Numeracy in  Disadvantaged Primary Schools" which is also relevant in this regard.  Furthermore, the Inspectorate's routine evaluations in DEIS schools as well as  recent reports by the ESRI and Barnardo's and the current NESF report will feed  into the evaluation.One of the key recommendations of the NESF report relates to enhanced  integration in service delivery. This is consistent with the integration of  social inclusion support services within the National Education Welfare Board.   With effect from 1 September 2009, the Home School Community Liaison Scheme  (HSCL), the School Completion Programme (SCP) and the Visiting Teachers Service  for Travellers (VTST) are now integrated under the NEWB and the NEWB is now  developing an integrated model of service building on the combined strengths of  the four services (HSCL, SCP, VTST and the Educational Welfare Service) to  deliver a child focused and integrated approach to school attendance, retention  and participation.The report includes a central overarching recommendation that a National  Literacy Policy Framework be put in place that has a ‘life-cycle' emphasis,  with the involvement of the various education and community stakeholders.Promoting literacy and numeracy skills is already a core element of the ongoing  work of schools as well as being a core objective of DEIS. National assessments  of achievement in reading literacy and mathematics are conducted at two points  in primary education, second class and sixth class, at approximately five-year  intervals. These assessments are conducted on behalf of my Department by the  ERC and the reports of the assessments are published.Having regard to the above, I will consider the recommendations to develop a  separate National Literacy Policy Framework in the light of the outcomes of the  review of the implementation of DEIS measures and of the assessment programmes  currently under way.

The programme  focuses on developing core skills in maths, ICT and business in order to  facilitate students progressing to other higher education programmes or to  completing their apprenticeship at a later stage. Participants will receive a  FETAC Level 5 Certificate in Construction Technology or Certificate in  Engineering Technology for the programme. The institutes have been working  closely with FÁS in making redundant apprentices aware of the scheme.  Programmes commenced in a number of Institutes of Technology September 2009.  This provision was sufficient to meet immediate demand. The institutes intend  to run further programmes in January 2010.

The application has been  assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large  scale building projects and assigned a band 2 rating.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all  assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred  to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published  prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the  Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of  which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching  to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my  Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget  of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.My Department sanctioned a devolved grant of €60,000 to enable the management  authorities of the school in question to build a Resource Room in March 2008.   It is understood that the school authority decided to build a Resource Room and  an All-Purpose Room costing €323,875.00 without the approval of my Department  and are now seeking retrospective funding.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is  the policy of my Department not to provide retrospective funding for works  which were carried out without Departmental approval.

Similarly tuition fees, under  the Free Fees Initiative, are not payable in respect of a second period of   college attendance on a course at the same level. These restrictions apply to  every student who already holds a qualification at the same level, irrespective  of where that qualification was obtained or whether or not funding was  previously awarded. Clause 7.6 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme refers.

These bodies do not  refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases,  where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the  relevant scheme is required.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a  maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one,  she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or  VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the  assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted  the schemes correctly in her/his case, an appeal form outlining the position  may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.No appeal has been received by my Department to date from the candidate  referred to by the Deputy.

The  third level institutions are autonomous bodies and, as such, may determine the  level of fees to be charged in such cases.   I have no role in this matter.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	882	The revised primary curriculum was launched in 1999 and provides an integrated programme of learning in the spheres of Languages, Mathematics, Social  Environmental and Scientific Education, Arts Education, Physical Education,  Social Personal and Health Education and Religious Education. Page 27 in the  Introduction to the Curriculum states "It is a particular feature of Irish  primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have  experience of language learning in two languages." The curriculum also  specifies a set of learning objectives for each area of the curriculum for 4  groupings — infant classes, first and second class, third and fourth class, and  fifth and sixth class. It also sets out a suggested minimum weekly time  framework for tuition. This provides that where a first language is being  taught, there should be four hours instruction per week, and 3 hours per week  where there is a shorter day for the infant classes. Where a second language is  being taught, the suggested minimum timeframe is 3.5 hours per week, and 2.5  hours per week for infant classes with a shorter day.My Department fully supports immersion models of education, but this does not  obviate the need for Irish medium schools to implement all elements of the  national curriculum. Furthermore the achievement of the curriculum objectives  in every curriculum area at each of the four levels of primary schooling is an  over-riding requirement in all schools. I am convinced of the importance of  ensuring that all children have access to the full primary curriculum from the  earliest possible stage. This approach is not in conflict with the strategy for  the Irish language.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	885	I am aware of the scheme run by the Jack and Jill Foundation whereby schools are provided with Interactive Whiteboards in return for recycling mobile  phones.  I understand that a large number of schools have registered for this  scheme.The recently published Advisory Group Report "Smart Schools = Smart Economy"  recommends an initial investment package of €150m over the next 3 years and I  am committed to making funding available for ICT in schools over these years.  As a first step, €22 million in grants was issued to primary schools last week,  with the priority on ensuring that there is a teaching computer and digital  projector in every classroom. Funding for post-primary schools will be made  available early in the New Year.One of the main recommendations of the Advisory Group Report is that, as a  minimum, a teaching computer be deployed in every classroom in 2009/2010, along  with a digital projector.  Schools who have been issued ICT grants are being  asked to prioritise the purchase of this equipment.  Once this level of  technology is in place in every classroom in the school, the funding may then  be used towards the purchase of other ICT devices such as interactive  whiteboards, digital video cameras, visualisers, speakers etc.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	887	My Department does not regulate the provision of private colleges.  In the context of a lifelong approach to learning, it would not be feasible to confine  all provision of education and training to providers which are nationally  accredited.  However, systems are in place to enable private colleges to access  external quality assurance and to offer programmes leading to nationally  recognised awards.The National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), was developed and is  maintained by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), a body  under the aegis of my Department.  The NFQ is a system of ten levels that  incorporates awards from basic literary awards up to doctoral degrees.  The NFQ  enables providers in public, private, workplace or community settings to offer  recognised awards in further or higher education. Quality assurance is central  to the NFQ and all awards which are recognised through the NFQ are quality  assured.Private colleges who comply with the relevant processes and standards can offer  courses leading to framework awards of the Further Education and Training  Awards Council (FETAC) or the Higher Education and Training Awards Council  (HETAC), bodies established under statute.   They must agree their quality  assurance arrangements with the relevant awards council, and satisfy the  council that the programmes leading to the awards are of an appropriate  standard, the necessary supports are in place for learners and the assessment  arrangements are fair and consistent. There are also procedures under which  international or professional bodies may seek to have their programmes aligned  with or included in the NFQ, if they wish to do so.  A substantial range of  such awards, including City and Guilds awards, have been aligned with the NFQ  and many private colleges offer programmes leading to such awards. My  Department is also bound by the Lisbon Convention and the EU Directive on  Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications to give appropriate  recognition to nationally accredited awards from other jurisdictions.It should be noted that under Sections 15 and 25 of the Qualifications  (Education and Training) Act 1999, State-funded providers of education and  training are required to have their programmes, other than recreational or  leisure programmes, validated by FETAC or HETAC. This does not prevent them  from offering the awards of other bodies such as City and Guilds in addition,  should they wish to do so. Awards bodies such as City and Guilds may also offer  their awards in the private sector, in line with EU obligations relating to the  provision of services.In addition to this, the Department's Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment  Policy Unit maintains an Internationalisation Register containing programmes  which are approved for the purpose of access to work by students who are  citizens from outside the EU/EEA and Switzerland. Only programmes which have  been quality assured and/or lead to recognised qualifications are included on  the Register. Both the Internationalisation Register and a list of recognised  higher education providers are maintained on the Department's website.  I will  also be providing for the introduction of a Code of Practice for colleges  providing education and training to international students and an associated  Quality Mark for those who can demonstrate compliance.  This will be provided  for in legislation being prepared to amalgamate NQAI, HETAC and FETAC and the  amalgamated agency will be responsible for adopting the Code of Practice and  monitoring compliance.Private schools may also offer the national curriculum if they wish to do so  and may seek recognition as examination centres from the State Examinations  Commission, or may enter students for certificate examinations as external  candidates. My Department does not quality assure or regulate schools which are  not State funded. However, under the Educational Welfare Act, there are  procedures in place for the purpose of ensuring that students receive a certain  minimum education in places other than recognised schools and centres of  education.

The Department of Foreign Affairs is  represented on the inter-agency group on international education which my  Department chairs, and will also be represented on the high-level group on  international education.  In order to ensure full awareness of the issues  involved in international education, my Department provides a full briefing to  Irish Ambassadors and other diplomats prior to their departure on overseas  posts.
